This is a redictation of a prior dictation that apparently did not go through. There is slightly rotated positioning. Compared with earlier the same day (___:___ p.m.), there is progression of opacification of the right lung, with only a small partially aerated portion of the lung seen in the upper zone. There may be some volume loss on the right, though this is difficult to confirm, due to rotation. The left lung is grossly clear, with resolution of previously seen left base opacity. No left-sided CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is identified at this time.Clips noted over lower mediastinum.
