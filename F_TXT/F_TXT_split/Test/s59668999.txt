The PICC line tip is in the mid SVC. There is bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, left greater than right; bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right; dense retrocardiac opacity and mild pulmonary vascular redistribution and alveolar infiltrate most marked on the right. Compared to the prior study, there has been some progression of the lower lobe infiltrates. The overall impression is that of CHF but an underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
