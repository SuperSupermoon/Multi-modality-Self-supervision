Cardiac silhouette size remains top normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with calcification of the aortic knob. There continues to be minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases which may reflect atelectasis. No pulmonary vascular engorgement is definitively noted. Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present, but no pneumothorax is identified.
