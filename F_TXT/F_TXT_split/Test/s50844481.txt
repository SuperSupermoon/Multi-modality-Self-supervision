An endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central venous catheter have been removed. A left internal jugular catheter follows a normal course terminating at the confluence of the left brachiocephalic and SVC. Surgical clips and mediastinal drains are noted in situ. Lungs are hyperexpanded. There is no new consolidation. Right mid lung triangular opacity persists and probably represents fissural fluid. Subtle right basilar opacity is similar to the prior exam, probably fluid. Left effusion and atelectasis have improved. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
