The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. Cardiomegaly is similar. There is continued mild to moderate pulmonary edema, slightly improved compared to the prior exam. Small layering bilateral pleural effusions also may be slightly decreased in the interval. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
