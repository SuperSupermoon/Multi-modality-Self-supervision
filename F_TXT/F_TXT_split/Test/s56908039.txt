A right internal jugular line ends at upper SVC, Swan-Ganz catheter through the left internal jugular approach ends approximately in the main pulmonary artery and endotracheal tube terminating 4.1 cm above the carina, all are appropriate in position. Two feeding tubes are seen coursing below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, their distal end is off the radiograph view. Two abdomen drains, one in the right hypochondriac region and other in epigastric region are unchanged in course and position. Bilateral lung volumes are low. Small right pleural effusion and lower lung atelectasis has improved. Increased retrocardiac density obscuring the left hemidiaphragm margins suggesting low lung atelectasis is unchanged. small left pleural effusion is stable. Top normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
