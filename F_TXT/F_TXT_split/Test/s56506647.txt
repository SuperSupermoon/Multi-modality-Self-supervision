In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little overall change in the degree of aeration of the lungs. Some suggested increased opacification at the left costophrenic angle could reflect some increasing effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax. Evidence of prior right upper lobe lobectomy and radiation therapy, better demonstrated on recent CT scan.
