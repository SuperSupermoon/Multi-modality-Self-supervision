AP chest compared to ___: There may be slightly less fluid in an air and fluid collection at the base of the right hemithorax lying just superior to a pigtail drain. With conventional radiographs, much less a single frontal view, it is impossible to say how the position of the tube relates to pleural collections. Right middle lobe is probably still collapsed. Left lung shows mild pulmonary vascular congestion as before, and a small left pleural effusion is stable. Heart size is normal. Right PIC line ends low in the SVC.
