AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Widening of the upper mediastinum to the right of the midline could be due to fluid filling in the esophagus, drained by an upper alimentary tube, ending in the lower third of the right paramedian mediastinum. ET tube is in standard placement. Lungs are well expanded. Pulmonary edema is mild. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema can be a normal finding this early after this type of surgery. There is no pneumothorax. The heart is normal size.
