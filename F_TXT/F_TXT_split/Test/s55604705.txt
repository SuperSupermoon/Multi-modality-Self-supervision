An endogastric tube courses inferiorly with its side port projecting over the stomach. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Bibasilar atelectasis persists with small bilateral pleural effusions. The lung parenchyma demonstrates minimally improved opacities, signifying improving edema or hemorrhage.
