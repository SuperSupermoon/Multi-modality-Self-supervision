The heart size appears moderately enlarged. The mediastinum demonstrates tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. There is perihilar haziness with vascular indistinctness, compatible with mild pulmonary edema. Hazy opacities in both lung bases likely reflect small layering bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar atelectasis. No large pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
