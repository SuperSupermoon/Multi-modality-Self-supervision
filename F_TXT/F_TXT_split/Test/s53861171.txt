Right IJ line and bilateral chest tubes, sternal wires and mediastinal clips are unchanged. A tiny left apical lateral pneumothorax is visualized. The right pneumothorax is probably still present but is very difficult to see. Both of these are smaller than on the film from the prior day. Continues to be retrocardiac opacity and volume loss/infiltrate in both lower lungs.
