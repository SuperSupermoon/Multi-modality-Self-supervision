As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube has been removed. There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions with relatively substantial areas of atelectasis. Size of the cardiac silhouette cannot be determined. No evidence of new parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. A left internal jugular vein catheter remains in situ.
