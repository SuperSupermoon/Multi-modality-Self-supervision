Sternotomy wires are unchanged. The heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits and stable. There has been interval decrease in a left-sided pleural effusion with some persisting left basilar atelectasis. The right lung is clear. A line between the posterior aspects of the left third and fourth rib space is more compatible with a skin fold rather than the visceral pleura of the lung, so pneumothorax is not favored. However, given the recent instrumentation, if growing clinical concern for pneumothorax exists, short-interval followup may be considered.
