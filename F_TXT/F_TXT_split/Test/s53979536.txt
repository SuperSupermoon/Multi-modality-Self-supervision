Opacification of the left hemithorax is a combination of increasing pleural effusion and a presumed increasing atelectasis in the remaining left upper lobe. Cardiomediastinal contours are midline. There is probably a tiny residual left apical pneumothorax. The right lower lobe atelectasis has improved. Left IJ catheter tip is unchanged. Left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema has improved.
