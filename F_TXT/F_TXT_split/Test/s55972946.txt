The patient is status post median sternotomy. Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the right atrium. Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the cardiac silhouette size which is likely mildly enlarged. Calcified mediastinal nodes are re- demonstrated reflective of prior granulomatous disease. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflect atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
