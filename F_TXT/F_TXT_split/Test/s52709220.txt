Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip being at least at the distal stomach. Right upper abdomen drain is in place. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC. The left internal jugular line crosses the midline with its tip continuing towards the right brachiocephalic vein and should be repositioned.
