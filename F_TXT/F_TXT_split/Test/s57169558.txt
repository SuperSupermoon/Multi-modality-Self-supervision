AP chest compared to ___: The patient has been extubated and lung volumes are lower. There has been a disproportional increase in caliber of the mediastinum, which could be due to bleeding or vascular engorgement due to cardiac tamponade. Lung periphery shows no vascular engorgement, so left heart function is not incriminated. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion, left basal pleural tube is still in place. Bibasilar atelectasis is only moderate and unchanged. Right subclavian line ends in the right atrium. ___ was paged as soon as this examination appeared for review and I discussed the findings with ___ at the time of dictation.
