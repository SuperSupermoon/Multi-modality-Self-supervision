The ET tube is 3.5 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach. Right IJ Cordis tip is in the proximal SVC. The heart size is moderately enlarged. There is ill-defined vasculature and alveolar infiltrate, right greater than left. This is markedly increased compared to the film from two hours prior and likely represents fluid overload.
