AP portable view of the chest. The lungs are relatively hyperinflated. Linear opacities at the left lung base again suggestive of atelectasis versus scarring. Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen particularly in the left upper and right lower lung. This could be due to asymmetric mild interstitial edema in the setting of the background of chronic lung disease noting that infection is also possible. The cardiac silhouette appears slightly enlarged. Median sternotomy wires again noted.
