Neither on the prior radiograph nor on the current study evidence of pneumothorax is seen on the right side. The patient's head obscures the left apex and prevents assessment of that area. Bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated, but there is interval improvement of pulmonary edema. Dilated right upper mediastinal contours relate to tortuous vessel as depicted by chest CT obtained at 12 prior to the radiograph.
