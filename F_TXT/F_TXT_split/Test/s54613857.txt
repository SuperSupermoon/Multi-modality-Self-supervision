AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 12 hours earlier during the same day. There is marked improvement of the previously identified massive pleural effusion occupying major portions of the right hemithorax. New pigtail end small caliber catheter is now seen on the right base and explains the evacuation of the pleural effusion that occurred during the interval. No pneumothorax has developed. The lung parenchyma on the right side appears free as this can be identified by the single AP chest view. On the left side, there is also a small caliber pigtail end catheter in the basal space of the pleura but no evidence of pleural effusion is seen. A previously described left-sided advanced PICC line remain in unchanged appropriate position and terminating just 2 cm below the level of the carina. An NG tube remains and is seen to point with the Dobbhoff tip towards the pylorus.
