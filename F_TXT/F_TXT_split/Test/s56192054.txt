AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Available for comparison is the next preceding similar study obtained six hours earlier during the same day. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. Diffuse hazy densities over the right hemithorax appear unchanged. The previously described right-sided pleural chest tube remains, but has changed its position, it points more towards the mediastinum at the level of the hilum. No evidence of residual or newly developed pneumothorax. As before, there is some soft tissue emphysema in the axillary area and right lower neck. These findings are unchanged.
