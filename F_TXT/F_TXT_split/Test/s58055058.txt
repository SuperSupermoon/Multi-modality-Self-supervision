In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2.8 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to at least the mid body of the stomach, where it crosses the inferior margin of the image. Right IJ catheter extends to about the level of the cavoatrial junction. Change in appearance of the right pleural effusion may reflect differences in patient position. Bilateral atelectasis and pulmonary edema are essentially unchanged.
