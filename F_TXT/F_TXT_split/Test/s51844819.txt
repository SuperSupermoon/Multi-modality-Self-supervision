The lungs appear hyperexpanded. There is mild increased pulmonary vascular congestion from ___. A small right pleural effusion is likely present with mild right basilar atelectasis. Right base consolidation is not entirely excluded. No significant left pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Suture chain material and scarring in the left upper-to-mid lung zone is not significantly changed. Multiple mediastinal surgical clips are compatible with history of CABG surgery. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size but unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits with moderate tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta. Lobulation at the apex of the left hemi thorax along the mediastinal border is stable, residual of slowly resolving hematoma.
