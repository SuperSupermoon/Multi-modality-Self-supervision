AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. Overall, there is no significant change from the recent CT performed ___ with innumerable metastatic nodularity involving both lungs and large consolidation occupying the right lower lung with a small to moderate right pleural effusion. There is no new area of atelectasis or new area of confluent opacity to suggest a superimposed pneumonia, though given the extensive underlying lung disease, a subtle acute process would be impossible to exclude. Heart size cannot be assessed. Mediastinal contour is stable. No pneumothorax is seen. Bony structures appear stable. Known metastatic lesions involving the inferior scapulae are not clearly visualized as well as the recently diagnosed nondisplaced fracture involving the right posterior eighth rib.
