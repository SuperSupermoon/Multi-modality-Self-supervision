AP chest compared to ___: Bedside frontal radiograph centered at the diaphragm shows nasogastric tube ending in the proximal duodenum, and the distal portions of a transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator and left ventricular pacer leads, as well as a right PICC lead that ends in the upper right atrium and retained epicardial leads. Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved, but there is still substantial consolidation at the right lung base probably largely atelectasis. There is no appreciable pleural effusion in the imaged portion of the chest. The apices of the lungs are not included in this image. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Intestinal gas pattern is unremarkable.
