Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The patient was intubated in the meantime interval with the ET tube tip being 4.2 cm above the carina. Additional right internal jugular line has been inserted with its tip at the level of superior SVC. The right PICC line tip is low in the right atrium and should be pulled back approximately 4 cm. Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged. Bilateral, right more than left pleural effusion is seen, but most likely moderate to large on the right and small on the left, potentially slightly increased since the prior study.
