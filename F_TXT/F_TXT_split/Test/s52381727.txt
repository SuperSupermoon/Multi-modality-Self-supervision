AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. The Dobbhoff tube has been inserted, currently following appropriate course. The left perihilar mass noted on the prior study is now associated with widespread opacities surrounding it, which may reflect bleeding or aspiration or interval development of infection. Bilateral pleural effusions have developed in the interim, small. No change in the right rib fractures is demonstrated, better assessed on the current study. Retrocardiac atelectasis has progressed in the interim. Given the multiple attempts to adjust the Dobbhoff tube, the bibasilar opacities and the left perihilar opacity may reflect aspiration, but infectious process cannot be excluded and should be closely followed.
