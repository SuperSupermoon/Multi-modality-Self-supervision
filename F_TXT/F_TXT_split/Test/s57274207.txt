Single upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours. However, subcutaneous emphhysema identified in the soft tissues of the neck and bilateral supraclaviaular region. Linear lucency tracking along the trachea concerning for pneumomediastinum. There is a stable left PICC line with tip at the cavoatrial junction. There is suggestion of a pleural fold approximately 4.5 cm from the apex with a paucity of lung markings in this region which may suggest a moderate-sized pneumothorax not evident on the prior study; however, there appears to be no evidence of the expected associated volume loss. Small rounded radiopaque density is noted projecting in the right mid lung and crossing a different bony structure than on prior study, indicating it is not within the bone and may represent a calcified granuloma. No pleural effusion evident. No osseous abnormality identified.
