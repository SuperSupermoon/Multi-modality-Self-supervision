In comparison to ___ radiograph, a tracheostomy tube is been placed, in standard position, with no visible pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Heart has slightly decreased in size in the interval, and pulmonary vascular congestion and edema have resolved in the interval. There remains dense opacification in the left retrocardiac region accompanied by a a decreasing small left pleural effusion. A vascular catheter courses from the inferior vena cava and extends superiorly beyond the right atrium into the superior vena cava, terminating at the level of the right tracheobronchial angle. Additional lateral chest radiograph may be helpful to determine precise positioning of the catheter.
