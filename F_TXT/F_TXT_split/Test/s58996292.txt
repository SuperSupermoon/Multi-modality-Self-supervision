The patient has received a new orogastric tube, which ends into the stomach but its distal end is looped with its tip reaching up to the fundus of the stomach approximately. Endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm above the carina and is appropriately positioned. Right internal jugular line tip is approximately at the level of the lower SVC/cavoatrial junction. Bilateral lung volumes are low. Mild diffuse haze in both lungs could be mild pulmonary edema, but given the low lung volumes, its appearance and severity may be exaggerated. Prominent hilus and azygos distension suggest increased venous pressure. Bi-basal opacity is due to combination of small effusion and accompanying atelectasis. Heart size is mild-to-moderately large, unchanged since prior studies. Increased retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung atelectasis has worsened.
