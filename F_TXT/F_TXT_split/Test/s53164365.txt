There has been interval worsening of moderate interstitial and airspace pulmonary edema. There is new collapse of the right upper lobe with superior retraction of the major fissure, likely due to bronchial encasement by right hilar adenopathy as seen on CT. There are innumerable metastatic pulmonary nodules and multifocal hazy opacities, better characterized on CT. Moderate cardiomegaly and central vascular congestion persist. Small bilateral pleural effusions, multiloculated on the left.
