Comparison is made with prior study performed eleven hours earlier. There are lower lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities are worsened, consistent with worsening pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis. Moderate pulmonary edema is stable with no pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Right HD catheter is in unchanged position.
