Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Aortic knob is densely calcified. The mediastinal contour is unchanged. Right hilar opacity is similar to the previous examinations. Rounded opacity projecting over the right mid lung field likely reflects fluid loculated within the major fissure. A moderate right pleural effusion and trace left pleural effusion are noted, and there is mild pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration is not excluded. No pneumothorax is present. Emphysematous changes are again seen in the lungs.
