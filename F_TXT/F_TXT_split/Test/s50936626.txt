In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better inspiration. Hemodialysis catheter is unchanged. The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size, although at this time there is no definite pulmonary vascular congestion. The left hemidiaphragm is not well seen, which could reflect small pleural effusion and atelectasis, though also could be related to overlying soft tissues. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
