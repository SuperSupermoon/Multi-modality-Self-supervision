AP chest compared to ___: Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular and hilar vascular engorgement are chronic, consistent with global heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. I do not think there is acute pulmonary edema, appreciable pleural effusion or evidence of pneumonia. Asbestos-related pleural calcifications noted.
