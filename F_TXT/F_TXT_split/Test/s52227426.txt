Bilateral lung volumes remain low. Pulmonary vascular congestion has significantly decreased. Over the last 24 hours, the right lower lung opacity likely from atelectasis and effusion has significantly decreased. Left retrocardiac opacity due to a left lower lung volume loss and probably associated small effusion is unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Orogastric tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach and is appropriate.
