Mild pulmonary edema is present. Left lower lung opacity is likely a combination of small atelectasis and probably a small effusion. Right small pleural effusion is presumed. Heart size is mildly enlarged, and the pulmonary vasculature is minimally congested. A right central line tip ends at lower SVC.
