There is mild cardiomegaly. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is a similar mild interstitial abnormality with prominence of central pulmonary vascularity, suggesting mild vascular congestion. In addition, patchy streaky opacities in the right mid and lower lung suggest a background of minor scarring or atelectasis. Although evaluation is limited, there is no definite pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is demonstrated, although it is noted that the left lung apex is obscured by a flexed chin.
