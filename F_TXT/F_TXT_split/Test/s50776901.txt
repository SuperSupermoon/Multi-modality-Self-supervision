There has been interval removal of a right internal jugular central venous catheter. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in patient position. Mild prominence of the hila suggest central pulmonary vascular engorgement with mild peribronchial cuffing. No definite focal consolidation is seen. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
