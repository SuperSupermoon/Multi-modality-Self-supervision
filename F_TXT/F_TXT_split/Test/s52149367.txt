AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. As before, the patient is status post sternotomy, aortic valve replacement and bypass surgery. Cardiomegaly as before. A right internal jugular approach central venous line remains in unchanged position and terminates in a location compatible with the upper portion of the right atrium. The diaphragmatic contours are bilaterally obscured and the lateral pleural sinuses are blunted. This is indicative of increasing pleural effusion in comparison with the previous portable postoperative chest examination. Pulmonary vasculature remains congested with considerable perivascular haze. No pneumothorax is seen. The comparison is extended to multiple previous postoperative examinations, signs of pleural effusion and pulmonary congestion existed already earlier. On the preoperative chest examination of ___, significant cardiomegaly existed already at that time. The pleural spaces are practically free.
