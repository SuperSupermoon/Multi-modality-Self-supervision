As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a Swan-Ganz catheter. Catheter shows a normal course, the tip, however, is located too much distal in the right pulmonary artery and must be pulled back by approximately 4 cm. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, low lung volumes, mild cardiomegaly, vascular stents in situ. Moderate to extensive right pleural effusion and mild left pleural effusion, both with evidence of atelectasis in the basal lung regions. No pneumothorax.
