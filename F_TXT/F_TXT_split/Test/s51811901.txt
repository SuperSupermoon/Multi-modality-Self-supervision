Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Large right pleural effusion has increased. There are worsening opacities in the right lower lobe, and right perihilar region which could be due to worsening atelectasis, but in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed infection is also possible. There is no evident pneumothorax or pleural effusion on the left side. Left pigtail catheter remains in place. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Left PICC tip is in the lower SVC. There is minimal atelectasis in the left mid lung.
