The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. Right-sided pacemaker/AICD device is again noted with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle, and the region of the coronary sinus, unchanged. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is moderate, and similar compared to the previous study. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There continues to be upper zone vascular redistribution, similar when compared to the previous study compatible with mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Lungs remain hyperinflated compatible with COPD. Linear opacities in the lung bases are compatible with scarring. Small bilateral pleural effusions are relatively unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
