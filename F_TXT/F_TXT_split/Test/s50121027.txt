Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate improved atelectasis in the right upper lung and left lower lung from previous imaging. A hazy opacity over the left lung base suggests a layering pleural effusion. A small area of hazy opacity at the right costophrenic angle may represent a small layering pleural effusion. Bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion is again seen, essentially unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
