Single portable view of the chest. Endotracheal tube is seen with tip within 1 cm of the carina and should be withdrawn. Enteric tube is seen with tip at the gastric fundus, side port likely just beyond the GE junction. Low lung volumes are seen. Surgical chain sutures project over the right mid lung with associated linear opacity, potentially atelectasis. Increased opacity at the right perihilar region. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are identified. Linear opacity at the left lung base may represent atelectasis. The bones are diffusely osteopenic.
