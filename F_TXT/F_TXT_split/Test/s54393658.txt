Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. An area of increased opacification of the left base may represent artifact from patient positioning or atelectasis, however superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There is a probable small left-sided pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
