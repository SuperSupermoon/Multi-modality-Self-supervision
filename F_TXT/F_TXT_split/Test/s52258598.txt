As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 6 cm above the carina. The patient also has a nasogastric tube, the tube could be slightly advanced, given that the sidehole is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. As compared to the previous image, the size of the cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged and signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema are seen. A right and left pleural effusion with subsequent areas of atelectasis has newly developed. No other parenchymal changes.
