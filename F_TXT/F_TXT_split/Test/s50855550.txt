AP chest compared to ___ preoperative study: Subcutaneous emphysema is severe in the thoracoabdominal wall and neck. I do not see pneumomediastinum for certain, and no pneumothorax, though I suspect this is not an erect chest radiograph which would be required to exclude that. Lung volumes are quite low, exaggerating what is probably mild edema seen best on the right, and mild cardiomegaly. Large mediastinal lymph node calcification in the AP window is noted. Dr. ___ was paged to recommend repeat examination primarily to exclude pneumothorax.
