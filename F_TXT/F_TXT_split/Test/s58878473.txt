Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, also unchanged. Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
