Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a right Port-A-Cath in unchanged position, terminating at the cavoatrial junction. Median sternotomy wires are present, along with surgical clips in the left upper quadrant. The heart is mildly enlarged, but stable compared with prior examinations, with redemonstration of calcified mediastinal lymph nodes. A rounded opacity in the lower left lung likely correlates to a calcified granuloma as seen on CT of the chest from ___. There is no evidence of pneumonia, pleural effusion, pneumothorax or overt pulmonary edema. The lung volumes are low, accentuating bibasilar atelectasis. No subdiaphragmatic free air is present.
