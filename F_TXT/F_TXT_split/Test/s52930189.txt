Patient is rotated slightly to the right. The patient is status post median sternotomy. Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly stable as compared to the prior study. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. Interstitial prominence suggests interstitial edema. Left retrocardiac opacity is seen which may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although focal consolidation is not excluded.
