CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 14:57 p.m., there is slight increased hazy opacity at right greater than left bases, ? atelectasis. Attention to these areas on followup films is recommended to exclude early pneumonic infiltrates. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and upper zone redistribution are unchanged. Bilateral pigtail type catheters are present. No pneumothorax or gross effusion is detected on either side. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, more pronounced than on the earlier film. A Dobbhoff-type tube is present, radiopaque tip overlying the stomach. A left subclavian PICC line tip overlies the distal SVC.
