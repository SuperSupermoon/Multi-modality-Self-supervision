As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone right thoracocentesis. The extent of the pre-existing pleural effusion has substantially decreased. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The signs indicative of mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema are also improved, but the heart continues to be large and the contours of the left hilus continue to be bulging outwards. Atelectasis at the left and right lung bases are unchanged. No evidence of pneumonia.
