Increased focal opacification demonstrated within the left lower lobe in setting of known transbronchial biopsy is likely related to focal hemorrhage superimposed on known area of focal opacification/though is out of proportion to expected. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Bronchiectasis of the left lower lobe is unchanged. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable demonstrating mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Heart size is within normal limits. Incidentally noted is a benign bone island demonstrated within the left humeral head.
