AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with a previous similar examination of ___, which also was performed with the patient in supine position. Moderate cardiac enlargement as before. Heart size may have increased slightly. However, portable technique in supine position does not allow precise assessment. Comparison with the next previous study clearly identifies a new parenchymal density in the left hemithorax in perihilar position extending into the left upper lobe. The previously identified left lower lobe linear densities suspicious for atelectasis persist. No new pulmonary abnormalities in the right hemithorax and no pneumothorax identified on either side. The patient is intubated and the ETT terminates in the trachea some 5 cm above the level of the carina.
