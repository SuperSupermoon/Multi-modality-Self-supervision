In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the apparent small pneumothorax tracking along the minor fissure is not definitely appreciated. There is hazy opacification of the right hemithorax with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with layering pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis at the base. Mild atelectatic changes are also seen on the left. The nasogastric tube has been removed. Right IJ catheter and left subclavian catheter remain in place.
