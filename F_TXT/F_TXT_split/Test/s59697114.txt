CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately 4.8 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A dual-lumen catheter is present, with tips over the mid and distal SVC. Clips noted overlying the right hilum. Allowing for lordotic positioning, no pneumothorax is detected. There is probable background COPD. There is cardiomegaly with a calcified aorta. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is tenting and/or fluid tracking at the right lung base. No gross effusion is identified. Compared with one day earlier, ___, at 5:09 a.m., the overall appearance is similar. There has been possible slight improvement in the CHF findings and in basilar aeration. The cardiomediastinal silhouette may also be slightly improved.
