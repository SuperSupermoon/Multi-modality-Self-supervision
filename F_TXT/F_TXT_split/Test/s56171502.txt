Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged in position with persistent widening of right mediastinal contour, a change in appearance from a standard PA and lateral chest radiograph of ___ but similar to the ___ radiograph. This could potentially be due to accentuation of tortuous vascular structures by low lung volumes and portable semi-erect technique, but attention to this area on repeat study with improved inspiratory volume would be helpful to exclude a mediastinal mass or hemorrhage. Slight improvement in bibasilar atelectasis. No new areas of lung opacification. Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions, seen to better detail on recent abdominal CT of the same date. Multiple bilateral healed rib fractures.
