Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right PICC line is at the level of cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium. In comparison to the prior study the appearance of the cardiac silhouette is increased, although it might reflect different rotation of the patient. The mediastinum is slightly widened. There is minimal vascular engorgement that might reflect mild degree of interstitial edema. Right pleural effusion is unchanged, small to moderate. Minimal amount of left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Atelectasis at the left lower lung is noted, linear, mild.
