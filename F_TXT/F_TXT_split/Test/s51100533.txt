Comparison is made with prior study performed 2 hours before. There are new kinked bilateral chest tubes . Cardiomediastinal is unchanged and midline. Increasing opacity in the right upper and lower lobes is consistent with infection. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. New left upper lobe opacity could represent infection or hemorrage. NG tube tip is out of view, below the diaphragm. Subcutaneous emphysema is new. Severe emphysema with multiple bullae is better seen in CT. ET tube is in standard position, the cuff seems overinfalted. Left subclavian catheter is unchanged
