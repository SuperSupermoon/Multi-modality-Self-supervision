AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. The patient is intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea 4 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. An NG tube has been placed, seen to reach well below the diaphragm including its side port. There is mild elevation of the left-sided hemidiaphragm, but no evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates or major atelectasis is identified. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. There exists no prior chest examination or records available for comparison.
