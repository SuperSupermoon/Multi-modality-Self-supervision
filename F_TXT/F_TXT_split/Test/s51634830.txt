1. Given patient rotation, the overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. The heart remains moderately enlarged and the aorta remains unfolded and tortuous. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. The lungs appear grossly clear. There is some blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which may reflect pleural thickening and/or a small pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. Prominent opacity in the right paratracheal region is felt to likely be vascular in etiology.
