The heart size is normal. Lung volumes are low. Biapical fibrotic changes with traction bronchiectasis is re- demonstrated. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests a trace left pleural effusion. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. Known fracture of the left 11th rib is not clearly delineated on this exam. Clips are seen projecting over the left upper quadrant. No new fractures are seen. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated.
