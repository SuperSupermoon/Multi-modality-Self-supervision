AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination with the patient in supine position as of ___. Again noted is status post sternotomy and significant enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Previously described permanent pacer in left axillary position with two intracavitary electrodes in unchanged location. Unchanged position of left internal jugular approach central venous line terminating in upper portion of SVC. No pneumothorax has developed. Diffuse haze over both lung bases as before obliterating the diaphragmatic contours and indicative of bilateral pleural effusions partially layering posteriorly. The pulmonary venous congestive pattern persists. An intra-aortic balloon pump device is seen to terminate in the descending thoracic aorta about 3 cm below the level of the lower thoracic arch contour. This is unchanged.
