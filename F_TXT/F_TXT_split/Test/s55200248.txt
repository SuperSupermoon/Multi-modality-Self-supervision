AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study dated ___. A right-sided PICC line is again identified. It is now seen to terminate overlying the right-sided mediastinal structures at the level of the carina. Thus, it has been withdrawn by approximately 4 cm in comparison with the preceding examination and is now in good position in the mid portion of the SVC provided good venous flow has been established. No pneumothorax or any other placement-related complications identified. Cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestive pattern with some pleural densities in left base as before.
