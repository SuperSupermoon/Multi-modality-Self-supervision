In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. Widespread airspace opacities, more prominent on the right, are consistent with diffuse pneumonia. The known abscess in the right lower lobe is seen in better detail on recent CT. Right pigtail catheter is seen at the base of the lung, presumably within the abscess cavity. Little change in the moderate pleural effusion.
