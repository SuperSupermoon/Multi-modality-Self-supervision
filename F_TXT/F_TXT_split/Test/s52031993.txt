Comparison is made with prior study performed 2 hours earlier. New ET tube tip is 1 cm from the carina and could be withdrawn a couple of centimeters for more standard position. Aeration of the lungs has improved. Small right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions are unchanged. There is less atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Left IJ catheter tip is in the upper to mid SVC. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Cardiomegaly is stable.
