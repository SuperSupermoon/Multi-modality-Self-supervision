Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. A left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis remains present. Left base retrocardiac opacity likely represents combination of atelectasis and effusion, although underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude. Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. No definite focal consolidation is seen in the right lung. The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
