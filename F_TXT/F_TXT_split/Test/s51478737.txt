Comparison is made with prior study performed 10 hours earlier. There is minimal decrease in still large amount of air in the pleural cavity in the right upper hemithorax. Two right chest tubes are in unchanged positions. Right subcutaneous emphysema is new. Cardiac size is normal. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is midline. Widened mediastinum, a post-op change, is stable. ET tube is in standard position. Right lower lobe has better aeration. There is persistent opacity in the right middle lobe. Mild interstitial edema has improved. The patient has known emphysema.
