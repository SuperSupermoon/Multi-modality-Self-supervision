As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.8 cm above the carina. The patient has also received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not visible on the current image. The right internal jugular vein catheter is in unchanged position. The atelectatic opacity at the right lung base is slightly increasing. There also is a disruption in the air column of the right main bronchus, so that bronchoscopic evaluation or clearance of potentially present mucus might be indicated.
