AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. There is no evidence of pneumothorax on either side which can be identified with this portable single view examination. Comparison with the next previous study suggests that the right-sided massive pleural densities have changed in position slightly and as much, there is improved aeration of the right upper lobe area and the previously identified large pleural density in the right axillary area impressing on the aerated lung tissue has clearly decreased. On the other hand, it is impossible to assess whether the loculated pleural effusion has shifted more to the lower areas. Again, portable chest examination does not allow assessment of the right-sided subhilar and parenchymal abnormalities. No new abnormalities are identified in the left hemithorax as there was no repeat lateral view, one cannot comment on the amount of pleural effusion on the left side identified on the preceding study. The draining PleurX catheter remains in place.
