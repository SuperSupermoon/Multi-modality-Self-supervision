Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier. Pulmonary edema has almost completely resolved. Widened mediastinum has improved. ET tube tip is 5.8 cm above the carina. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the main pulmonary artery. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Mediastinal and bilateral chest tubes are in place. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The fifth sternal wire has slightly changed position, and attention in this area should be paid in followup studies. The other sternal wires are aligned.
