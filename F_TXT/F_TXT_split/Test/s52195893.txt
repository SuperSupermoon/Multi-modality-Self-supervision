Evaluation of the study is somewhat limited by patient rotation.There are low lung volumes. The cardiac silhouette size is enlarged, similar when compared to the prior study. There is mild pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness, not significantly different when compared to prior study. A small to moderate right pleural effusion is increased when compared to the prior exam. Right basilar opacification may reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely excluded. No pneumothorax is present. Gaseous distention of the stomach noted.
