The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The heart remains moderately enlarged. Aortic knob calcifications are again seen. Low lung volumes are present with crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is no overt pulmonary edema, with a small left pleural effusion likely present. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis. Infection cannot be excluded. The right costophrenic angle is excluded, but no large right pleural effusion is demonstrated. There is no pneumothorax.
