A left Port-A-Cath terminates within the mid SVC. Lower lung volumes are noted, leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Mild atelectasis is seen at the left lung base. A calcified lymph node is again noted within the aorticopulmonary window. There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema. The patient is status post median sternotomy, and cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
