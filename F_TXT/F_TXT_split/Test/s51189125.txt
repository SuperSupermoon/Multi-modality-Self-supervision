In comparison with the study of ___, there has been development of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications with widening of the vascular pedicle. In view of the injury to the manubrium, this most likely represents congestive failure, possibly exacerbated by large amounts of fluid replacement. Bilateral pleural effusions are seen with compressive atelectasis at the bases. In view of the multiple traumas, the possibility of fat embolism syndrome would have to be considered if diuretic therapy is insufficient to cause clearing of the radiographic findings.
