Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated to the left. Large area of opacification involving the right mid to lower lung suggests pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. There is also blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to pleural effusion. The left retrocardiac opacity and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is seen, may be due to pleural effusion and atelectasis although underlying consolidation not excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are shifted leftward of midline presumably due to patient positioning/rotation. Suggest repeat with better positioning when patient able.
