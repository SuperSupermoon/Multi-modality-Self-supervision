Single, AP, upright, portable view of the chest was obtained. There are increased interstitial marking. Given history of pulmonary fibrosis on prior CT, although increased interstitial markings have significantly increased since the prior and there may be superimposed pulmonary edema. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is slight blunting of both costophrenic angles, felt most likely be due to overlying soft tissues, but a trace pleural effusions be difficult to exclude. No right pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax.
