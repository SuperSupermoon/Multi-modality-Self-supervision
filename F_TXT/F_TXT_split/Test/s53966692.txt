There is marked scoliosis with convexity to the right, similar to prior examinations and with increased patient rotation to the right. In the interval from the prior examination, obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm may be due to pleural effusion and atelectasis, though a consolidation or pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There may be mild interstitial edema. Patchy right lower lobe opacity may be due to infection or aspiration. No pneumothorax is seen. The heart is mildly enlarged. An endotracheal tube is in standard position with tip near the inferior margin of the clavicular heads. An esophageal catheter has been placed, coursing inferior to the diaphragm with side port within the stomach and tip out of view of the radiograph. A left-sided dual-lead pacemaker is in standard position.
