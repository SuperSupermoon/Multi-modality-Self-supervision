As compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum are again demonstrated. Bilateral pneumothoraces are not clearly identified on today's exam. Heterogeneous opacities in the right lung are similar, and exam is otherwise remarkable for worsening left basilar atelectasis with adjacent small left pleural effusion.
