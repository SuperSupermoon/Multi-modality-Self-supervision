As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared right pleural effusion, as suspected. The left costophrenic sinus is also mildly blunted, so that the presence of a small pleural effusion is likely. The size of the cardiac silhouette as well as the multifocal bilateral right predominant parenchymal opacities are unchanged in extent and severity.
