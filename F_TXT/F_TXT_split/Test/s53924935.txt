Single AP portable erect view of the chest was obtained. Relatively increase in opacity projecting over the right lung base is seen, which raises concern for underlying consolidation. Dedicated PA and lateral views of the chest would be helpful for further evaluation. Left lung is clear. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely relates to overlying soft tissue. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable. Right-sided vascular stent is unchanged in position. No evidence of free air is seen beneath the hemidiaphragms.
