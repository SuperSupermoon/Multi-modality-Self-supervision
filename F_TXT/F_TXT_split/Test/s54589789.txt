FINDINGS In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again seen. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There is some prominence of the central pulmonary vessels on the right, possibly relating to pulmonary artery hypertension. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pleural effusion. Mild retrocardiac opacification most likely represents atelectasis.
