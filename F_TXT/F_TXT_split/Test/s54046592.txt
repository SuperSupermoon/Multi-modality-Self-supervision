Triple-lead left-sided AICD is again seen with leads extending to the expected position of the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus. The lead extending to the coronary sinus, the distal aspect of which is partially obscured by the overlying battery pack. There are extremely low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. The left lung base is obscured by patient's overlying battery packs and not well evaluated. Right basilar atelectasis is seen. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which may be due to small pleural effusion. Aortic knob calcification is again seen. The cardiac silhouette is grossly stable. There is gaseous distention of the stomach and possibly the colon.
