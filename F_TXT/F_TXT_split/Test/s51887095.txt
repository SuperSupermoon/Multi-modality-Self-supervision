There is persistent opacification of the right lower lung field, likely due to known pleural effusion and atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is again noted. Overall, there has been no significant interval change. Endotracheal tube, left internal jugular catheter, and esophageal catheter are again seen in similar positions with esophageal catheter tip out of view. No pneumothorax is detected.
