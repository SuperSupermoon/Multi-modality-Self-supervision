As compared to the previous radiograph, the evidence of pulmonary edema, of moderate severity, is unchanged. The patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. Only the right internal jugular vein catheter persists. The ventilation at the left and right lung base is improved. There is unchanged evidence of scarring in the left mid lung and evidence of right basal pleural calcifications. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
