AP chest compared to ___: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has worsened. Nasogastric tube ends in the mid stomach. Left PIC line tip is in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax.

Greater opacification in the right lower lobe and elsewhere could be combination of dependent edema and atelectasis but could also be an early focus of pneumonia. Careful followup advised.
