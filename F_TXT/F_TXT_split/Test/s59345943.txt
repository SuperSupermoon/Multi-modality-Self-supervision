As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of moderate cardiomegaly and a right pleural effusion. The signs indicative of fluid overload have increased in extent, best visible in the left upper lung. There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially indicative of the presence of a small pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumonia.
