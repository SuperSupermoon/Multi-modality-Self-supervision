The patient is markedly rotated to his left limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. The heart remains enlarged. There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube with placement of a tracheostomy tube, which has its tip at the thoracic inlet. The right subclavian PICC line still has its tip in the distal SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the expected location in the stomach. Patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region may reflect an area of atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Probable small layering left effusion.
