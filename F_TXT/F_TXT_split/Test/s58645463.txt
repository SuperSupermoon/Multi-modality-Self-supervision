CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW The carina is not well delineated. Allowing for this, the ET tube lies approximately 4.6-5.3 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present -- the tip extends beneath diaphragm, off film. Additional tubing is looped over the upper abdomen in the midline. A right IJ sheath is present, tip over distal IJ, proximal to its point of confluence with the subclavian vessel. Of note, a stent is present in this location. An additional stent is seen along the expected course of the left innominate vein. The lungs are hyperinflated. The heart lies to the left of midline, raising the question of some volume loss on the left side. There is increased retrocardiac density. There are prominent interstitial markings in both lungs, of uncertain etiology or significance. The hila are obscured by the interstitial markings. No gross effusion. Innumerable calcific densities in the spleen suggest prior granulomatous disease. Two calcified nodes are also seen along the expected course of the splenic artery. Question also a calcified node in the neck. The bones appear diffusely dense. Compared to ___, no definite change is detected. Increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is again seen.
