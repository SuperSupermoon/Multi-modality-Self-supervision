Lung volumes are low. Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. There is mild pulmonary edema, perhaps minimally worse compared to the previous exam. Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present, and bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pneumothorax is present though assessment of the left apex is slightly obscured due to the patient's neck and soft tissues projecting over this region. Degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint are noted.
