Frontal view of the chest was obtained. Large bilateral pleural effusions are present with adjacent opacities most consistent with compressive atelectasis. Cephalization and indistinct appearance of the pulmonary vasculature are consistent with pulmonary edema. Heart size is not well assessed but appears enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable.
