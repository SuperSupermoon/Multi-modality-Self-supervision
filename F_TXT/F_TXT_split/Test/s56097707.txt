Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of a large-bore dual-lumen right central venous catheter, distal aspect not well seen, but likely terminating at the cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is a left base opacity, likely represents combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. There is a moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. No pneumothorax seen.
