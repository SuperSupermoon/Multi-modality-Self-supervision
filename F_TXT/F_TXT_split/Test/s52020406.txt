Comparison is made to prior study from ___. The Swan-Ganz catheter, left-sided pacemaker, endotracheal tube, feeding tube and mediastinal wires are all unchanged in position. There is a confluent area of opacity in the left upper lobe which is stable. There is an increase in opacity at the right base, which may be due to developing infiltrate or atelectasis. There is an unchanged left retrocardiac area which may represent underlying infiltrate and/or pleural effusion. There is a left ventricular prominence. No pneumothoraces are present.
