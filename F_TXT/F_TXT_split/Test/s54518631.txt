AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___ obtained at 15:35 p.m. Findings on a new portable chest examination are practically identical with those of the previous study. Position of pigtail end catheter in the right lower hemithorax unaltered. The same holds for the right-sided pleural effusion and the hydropneumothorax with rather high degree of right lung collapse. No new abnormalities identified. No significant mediastinal shift is observed.
