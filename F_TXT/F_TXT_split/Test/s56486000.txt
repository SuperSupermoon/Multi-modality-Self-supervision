Lung volumes are low. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm appears similar. Cardiomegaly is again noted. Minimal linear left basilar opacity appears similar and likely represents atelectasis. Of note, evaluation is slightly limited in the absence of lateral view. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen on this single view. No focal consolidation is seen on this single view. Aortic calcifications are again noted. Radiopaque material in the left abdomen may represent previously ingested oral contrast.
