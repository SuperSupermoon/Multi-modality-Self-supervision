AP radiograph of the chest was compared to chest CT from ___. The left upper lobe opacity has substantially increased in size as compared to prior chest CT most likely reflecting bronchoscopy hemorrhage (2.5 cm craniocaudal dimension to 3.5 cm in the craniocaudal dimension). There is new left retrocardiac opacity that might reflect small area of atelectasis/aspiration. The rest of the lungs are clear. There is no appreciable pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax.
