Moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette has developed, compatible with pericardial effusion. There are numerous metastatic pulmonary nodules in the lower lobes, left greater than right, better evaluated on recent PET-CT. Median sternotomy wires are noted, with fracture of the superior most wire. There are no significant pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
