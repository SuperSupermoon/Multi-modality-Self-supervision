An endotracheal tube terminates 4.1 cm above the carina. In enteric tube terminates in the proximal stomach and could be advanced 5-6 cm for ideal positioning. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Low lung volumes. Minimal elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is also stable. The left lung base is not visualized. Increased opacity at the base of the left lung may reflect atelectasis. There is mild vascular congestion with mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
