Portable AP ___-degree upright view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior studies. An endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carina. A left-sided internal jugular line ends in the upper SVC and a right-sided internal jugular line ends in the mid superior vena cava. Upper enteric tube passes into the stomach and off the radiograph. Right upper lobe predominant pulmonary edema has improved on today's study, however, right upper lobe atelectasis persists. Right middle lobe atelectasis is also unchanged. Upper lung vascular redistribution and enlarged pulmonary arteries are chronic. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. A small right pleural effusion has increased. Median sternotomy wires are aligned and intact.
