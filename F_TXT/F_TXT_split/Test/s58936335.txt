Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The right costophrenic angle is not included on the images. Again seen is a large area of right mid-to-lower lung opacity which is better assessed on prior CT from ___. There is a moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, an underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Streaky and fibrotic opacities are seen in the right lung involving the upper, mid and lower lung fields, most noted in the left mid lung field, also seen on the prior study. Left apical pleural thickening and calcifications are again seen, consistent with chronic change. No large left pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Multiple old right-sided rib deformities/fractures are again seen. A left sided vascular stent is again partially imaged.
