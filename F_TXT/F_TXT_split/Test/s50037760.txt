The patient's chin obscures visualization of the lung apices. Stable linear opacification in the left mid lung likely represents atelectasis or scarring. Calcified bilateral pleural plaques are again seen. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is detected. Cardiomegaly persists. The aorta is tortuous with calcification.
