The cardiac silhouette is again noted to be markedly enlarged but unchanged from approximately four hours prior. Again, this is consistent with an underlying pericardial effusion. Further obscuration of the pulmonary vascularity indicates development of mild pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. No pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacification is likely atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
