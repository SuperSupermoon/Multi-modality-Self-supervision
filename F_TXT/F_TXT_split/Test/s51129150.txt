A left Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium, unchanged from prior. Lung volumes are extremely low resulting in bronchovascular crowding and limited evaluation of the lung bases. Diffuse interstitial opacities have increased, and despite the low lung volumes, findings are consistent with superimposed pulmonary edema on a background of pulmonary fibrosis. No large pleural effusion is evident. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. High density material within multiple mid thoracic vertebral bodies is likely related to prior kyphoplasty, unchanged from prior.
