A left PICC has been re-positioned with the tip now terminating in the left brachiocephalic vein. Replacement is recommended. There are persistent low lung volumes and increased opacification of the right lung base reflecting increased small bilateral pleural effusions and worsening atelectasis. Left basilar atelectasis is also increased. There is no pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged without overt pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains mildly enlarged but stable. Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and calcification of the aortic knob is again seen.
