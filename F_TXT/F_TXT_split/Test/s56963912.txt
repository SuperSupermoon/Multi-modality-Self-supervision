Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Patchy and linear opacity has developed at the left lung base, and may reflect atelectasis although coexisting aspiration or infectious pneumonia is possible. Band-like linear atelectasis at the right base has worsened in the interval. Otherwise, no short-interval change since recent study.
