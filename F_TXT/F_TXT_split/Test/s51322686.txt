The study is somewhat limited secondary to positioning. The patient is markedly rotated. Again seen is a large-bore dual-lumen catheter from a left subclavian approach. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again evident and slightly exaggerated. There is engorgement of the vascular pedicle and cephalization of the pulmonary vascularity, which is likely at least in part due to the supine positioning. Linear atelectasis is seen in the retrocardiac left lower lobe. No focal consolidation is seen. The mediastinum again demonstrates a tortuous aorta exaggerated by the rotation. Likewise, the cardiac silhouette is stable, but exaggerated. No large effusion is noted. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is relatively stable. There is no pneumothorax.
