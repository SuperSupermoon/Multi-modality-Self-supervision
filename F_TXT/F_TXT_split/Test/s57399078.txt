The endotracheal tube terminates 3.6 cm above the level of the carina. There are multiple areas of increased radiodensity most severe in the right upper lung, but also within the medial right lower lung and in the retrocardiac region. Findings are most concerning for multifocal pneumonia. There is no overt pulmonary edema or large pleural effusions. There is apparent mild widening of the mediastinal contours secondary to the supine technique. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. Please see concurrent chest CT report for additional details.
