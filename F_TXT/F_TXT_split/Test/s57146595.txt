As compared to the previous radiograph, the right and left chest tubes have been removed. Lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved inspiration. The pre-existing miniscule right apical pneumothorax is no longer clearly visible. Unchanged mild air collections in the left and right perithoracic soft tissues. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, no pulmonary edema. Normal hilar and mediastinal structures. Unchanged proximal right clavicular fracture.
