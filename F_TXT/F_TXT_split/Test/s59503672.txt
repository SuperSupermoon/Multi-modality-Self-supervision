Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from ___. As on prior, the lungs are hyperinflated with parenchymal changes suggestive of emphysema, particularly at the left lung apex. Increased interstitial markings are identified at the left lung base. Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. Linear patchy at the right lung base is compatible with atelectasis versus scarring.
