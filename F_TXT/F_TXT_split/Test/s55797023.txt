Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. The heart remains moderately enlarged. There is mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle, again seen, which may reflect pleural thickening or small pleural effusion. Vague opacities within the right-mid lung may represent atelctasis or early pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax or findings for pulmonary edema.
