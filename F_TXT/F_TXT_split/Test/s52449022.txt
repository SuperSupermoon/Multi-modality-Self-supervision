Lung volumes are low, similar when compared to the prior study. Even allowing for the projection, the heart is enlarged. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature which appears hazy consistent with a degree of congestive heart failure. No overt pulmonary edema seen. Left lower lobe atelectasis, unchanged. No consolidation or pneumothorax seen.
