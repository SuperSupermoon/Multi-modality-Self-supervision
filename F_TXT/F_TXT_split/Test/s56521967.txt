Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. There has been interval worsening in opacification in the left hemithorax; this is consistent with increasing atelectasis of the remaining upper lobe and increasing pleural effusion. In the right lung, there are atelectasis in the lower lobe. Left IJ catheter is in unchanged standard position. Left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema has also improved. Cardiomediastinal structures are midline partially excluded by the pleural parenchymal abnormalities on the left. There is left apical pneumothorax probably unchanged.
