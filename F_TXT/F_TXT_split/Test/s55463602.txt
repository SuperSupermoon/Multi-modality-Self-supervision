Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Clearing of the right base is consistent with decrease in size of the pleural effusion and improved aeration. Persistent retrocardiac opacity corresponds to atelectasis and probable left pleural effusion. There is moderate pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Monitoring and support devices are in the appropriate position.
