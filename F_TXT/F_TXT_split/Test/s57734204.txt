As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The extensive right lower lung opacity and the opacity along the right chest tube are constant. Massive air collection in the soft tissues, leading to dissection into muscle tissue and subsequent display of multiple linear structures. There is no currently obvious pneumothorax. Unchanged position of the monitoring and support devices, with exception of the nasogastric tube that has been removed in the interval. Unchanged small cardiac silhouette.
