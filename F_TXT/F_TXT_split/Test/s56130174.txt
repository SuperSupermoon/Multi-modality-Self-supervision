CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 17:55 p.m., I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is the left sided tube, left lung hyperlucency, and left-sided volume loss, with compensatory slight hyperextension of the right lung, leftward shift of the mediastinum, and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with pneumonectomy. Minimal atelectasis or scarring at the right base is unchanged. Epidural catheter again noted.
