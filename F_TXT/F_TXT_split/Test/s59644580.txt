AP chest compared to ___: Widespread ground-glass pulmonary opacification, probably edema, has recurred after earlier improvement between ___. Though the most likely explanation is cardiac, conceivably transfusion of blood products or new medication could be responsible. The greater opacification in the left lower lobe is most readily explained by atelectasis in the setting of a very large left heart, but pneumonia due to aspiration would be radiographically indistinguishable. Small left pleural effusion is stable. There is no pneumothorax. Transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead, left ventricular lead, and the posteriorly positioned right atrial lead are all unchanged in their respective positions as far as one can tell from a solitary frontal radiograph. No pneumothorax.
