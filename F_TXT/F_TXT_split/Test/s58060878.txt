In comparison with the study of ___, there are substantially lower lung volumes which may account for much of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Obliquity of the patient makes interpretation difficult. There is opacification silhouetting the outer aspect of the left hemidiaphragm, suggesting volume loss in the lower lobe with pleural effusion. No definite vascular congestion. Specifically, there is no evidence of pneumothorax on this somewhat limited study.
