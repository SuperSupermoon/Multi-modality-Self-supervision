There has been interval widening of the mediastinum due to vascular engorgement. In addition, there is new bilateral interstitial edema.

The small right pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The support and indwelling lines are unchanged and in their expected locations.
