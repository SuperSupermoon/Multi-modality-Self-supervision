AP chest compared to ___ at 4:33 a.m. and 1:08 p.m.: New endotracheal tube in standard placement. Edema in the left lung appears less radiodense but this may be a function of better inflation following tracheal intubation. Severe right lung scarring and concurrent emphysema make it difficult to determine if a concurrent pneumonia is present. Heart size is normal. Right pleural thickening is more pronounced now than it was in ___ suggesting either a component of pleural effusion or pathologic pleural involvement.
