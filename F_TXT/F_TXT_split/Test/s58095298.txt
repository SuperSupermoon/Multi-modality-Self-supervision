Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in standard position. Swan-Ganz catheter has been slightly withdrawn, with tip terminating in the central right hilar region. Left sided catheter has been removed, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged, but previously reported mild edema has nearly resolved. Bibasilar retrocardiac atelectasis is present with some improvement on the left, and small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
