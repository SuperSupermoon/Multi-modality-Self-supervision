AP view of the chest. Right PICC is seen with tip at the upper SVC. Relatively low lung volumes are seen. The lungs however remain clear without consolidation, effusion or pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiac silhouette appears moderately enlarged, likely accentuated due to low lung volumes and AP technique.
