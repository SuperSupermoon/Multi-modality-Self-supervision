Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are relatively low lung volumes. Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. There has been interval removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes. There is pulmonary vascular congestion. No large pleural effusions are seen, although a trace effusion on the left would be difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.
