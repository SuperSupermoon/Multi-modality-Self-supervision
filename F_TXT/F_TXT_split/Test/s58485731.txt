1. The Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen coursing down into the stomach and then courses back up into the upper esophagus where the tip is positioned. Removal with an attempt at repositioning of the Dobbhoff feeding tube would be advised at this time. The endotracheal tube remains in place and the tip is difficult to identify as this is the location where the Dobbhoff feeding tube appears to be coiled within the esophagus. However, it is likely unchanged in position. There has been median sternotomy. Stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. There are layering effusions bilaterally with some associated patchy airspace disease, which most likely represents compressive atelectasis. Overall, there has been interval improvement in the pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen. Results of this examination were conveyed directly to the patient's nurse, ___, on ___ at 11:55 a.m. The patient's nurse stated that the feeding tube has already been withdrawn and a new feeding tube has been put in place.
