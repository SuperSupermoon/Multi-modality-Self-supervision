Known heterogeneous consolidation in the left mid lung is not well seen on this single frontal view. Additional known nodules are also not well characterized on this radiographic examination. Linear opacities in the lung bases are similar compared to prior and likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. No overt pulmonary edema is identified. Increased attenuation in the right mid-lung could reflect pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema. Mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles is unchanged and possibly due to small effusions or chronic pleural thickening. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
