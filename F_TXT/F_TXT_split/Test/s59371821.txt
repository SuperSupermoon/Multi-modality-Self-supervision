Single portable semi upright AP image of the chest. The lungs are well expanded and clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from prior exam with prominence of the right pulmonary artery again noted. The apparent enlargement of the aorta is due to adjacent atelectasis, as seen on recent CT.
