AP radiograph of the chest Heart size and mediastinum are grossly stable. Interval increase in right pleural effusion is suspected, although in part it may be related to different character of that study being semi-erect as opposite to portable study on the prior examination as well as more symmetric and not rotated image acquisition. Left retrocardiac opacity might reflect area of atelectasis, slightly worse since prior examination. It also might be due to large hiatal hernia. Infectious process, developing in this location would be another possibility.
