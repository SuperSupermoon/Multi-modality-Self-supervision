Single semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained. Opacity projecting over the right mid to lower lung is likely due to pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. If want to know full extent of pleural effusion, consider decubitus views. There is a nodular opacity projecting over the lateral right lower hemithorax, most likely representing nipple shadow, although attention at followup once pleural effusion resolved is suggested. There is a small left pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified.
