Compared with the immediate prior study of earlier on the same day there has been new or right middle lobe and right lower lobe collapse. There is likely trace associated layering right pleural effusion. The endotracheal tube terminates 4.3 cm from the carina. A left subclavian central venous catheter terminates the junction of the SVC with the brachiocephalic vein. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view. An inferior approach central venous catheter terminates in the IVC, unchanged. There is no left-sided pleural effusion or consolidation.
