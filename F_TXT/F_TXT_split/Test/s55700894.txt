Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___, and multiple prior studies dating back at least to the chest CT from ___. Extensive parenchymal opacities appear to be unchanged since the prior study involving the entire lungs. There is small amount of bilateral pleural effusion most likely present. There is a right internal jugular line tip terminating at the level of superior SVC. There is no substantial difference overall since the prior examination demonstrated. Although the presumed diagnosis of this patient with pulmonary edema, other factors contributing to the parenchymal involvement such as diffuse widespread infection or ARDS should be clinically considered.
