Bedside upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates little interval change when compared to prior study performed 24 hours ago. There is minimal, stable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal contours consistent with mild chronic heart failure. Persistent obscuration of the pulmonary vascular markings in the right lung base is consistent with trace pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis is still present. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. A left internal jugular central venous catheter, an endotracheal tube, and an orogastric tube are unchanged and appropriately positioned. The chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes are once again noted.
