In comparison with the study of ___, there are substantially lower lung volumes. The tip of the nasogastric tube is in the upper stomach with the side hole probably just above the gastroesophageal junction. The tube could easily be pushed forward about 5 cm. Low lung volumes may account for much of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart and fullness of pulmonary vessels, though some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure could well be present. Some atelectatic changes are seen in the retrocardiac region. No change in the appearance of the cervical fusion. Metallic anchors are seen about the right shoulder.
