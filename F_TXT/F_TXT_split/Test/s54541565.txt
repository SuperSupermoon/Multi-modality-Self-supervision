Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Again seen, there are increased diffuse interstitial opacities bilaterally, may be due to pulmonary edema, although appears less severe than on the prior study. Slight blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles may be due to small bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Left subclavian stent is again seen.
