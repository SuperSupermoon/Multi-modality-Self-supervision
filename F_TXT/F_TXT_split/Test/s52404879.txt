There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which is low lying with tip approximately 1.6 cm above the carina. An esophageal tube is in place coursing inferior to the diaphragm; however, tip out of view of the radiograph. Lung volumes remain low with mild pulmonary edema. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, however, unchanged.
