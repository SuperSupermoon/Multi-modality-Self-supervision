In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. Widespread airspace opacities, more prominent on the right, are consistent with diffuse pneumonia. The known abscess in the right lower lobe is better seen in detail on recent CT scan. Pigtail catheter is again seen at the base of the lung on the right, presumably within the abscess cavity. Little change in the moderate pleural effusion.
