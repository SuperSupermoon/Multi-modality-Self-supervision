Single AP semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained. Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema is again seen. Difficult to exclude underlying pleural effusions. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There has been interval placement of a large-bore left-sided catheter, distal tip not optimally seen, but likely terminates in the cavoatrial junction/right atrium.
