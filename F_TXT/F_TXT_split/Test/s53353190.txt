Portable AP chest radiograph is obtained with patient in the upright position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. On the left, there are unchanged areas of basal atelectasis and a moderate left pleural effusion that is unchanged. There is improvement in the pulmonary edema with persistence of mid right lung hazy opacification laterally, possibly suggesting consolidation in this region.
