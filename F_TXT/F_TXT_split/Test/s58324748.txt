As similar to multiple prior exams, there is a relative hazy density in the bilateral hilar regions with pulmonary vascular indistinctness. The hemidiaphragms are not well defined. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is markedly enlarged with widening superiorly and an enlarged cardiac silhouette inferiorly. The patient's chin overlies the lung apices, limiting the evaluation. No gross pneumothorax is seen.
