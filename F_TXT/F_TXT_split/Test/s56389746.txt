Compared to the previous radiograph, the left IJ catheter has been removed. There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions along with unchanged opacification of right lung base. This suggests right middle and lower lobe collapse. Comparison is limited by patient rotation on current imaging. Opacification at the left lung base is unchanged, and pneumonia cannot be excluded.
