Single AP erect portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube which appears to terminate approximately at the level of the medial left diaphragm and may extend to the mediastinum. There has been re-expansion of the left lung with opacity in the left mid-to-lower lung which could be due to pulmonary hemorrhage/contusion, partial collapse, or less likely infection. Subcutaneous emphysema is seen along the left chest wall.
