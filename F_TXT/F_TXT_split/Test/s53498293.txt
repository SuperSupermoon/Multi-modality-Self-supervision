As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing mild pulmonary edema has increased in severity and is now moderate. This is reflected by increased vascular diameters and left predominant perihilar haze. No pleural effusions. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. The areas of left basal atelectasis are constant in appearance.
