Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina. The temporary pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of the right ventricle. The patient continues to be rotated. Within the limitations, the appearance of the mediastinum is stable. Left retrocardiac opacity cannot be excluded, most likely representing atelectasis. Right upper lobe opacity is unchanged as well, with atelectasis or infectious process being a possibility. No interval development of pneumothorax or increase in pleural effusion has been demonstrated.
