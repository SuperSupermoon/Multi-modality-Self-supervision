Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from earlier the same day at 2:38 p.m. There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube projecting over the left lower hemithorax. There is overlying subcutaneous gas. Lucency still persists adjacent to the mediastinum on the left. Otherwise, there has been no change. Multiple right-sided rib fractures are better seen on the prior exam.
