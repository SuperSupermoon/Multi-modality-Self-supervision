AP chest compared to ___: As far as I can tell, given the severe anatomic distortion of the chest cage and its contents, lungs were clear on ___. Small region of opacification may have been developing lateral to the left hilus on ___, and today there is a suggestion of some new opacification at the base of the lung, but these observations are far from certain. I am not even confident that conventional radiographs, should the patient be able to cooperate for them, would clarify the issue. CT scanning, if feasible, would certainly confirm if the lungs are clear, but in the absence of a baseline study it might be difficult to distinguish atelectasis from pneumonia. Pleural effusion is minimal if any. Heart is probably not enlarged. Nasogastric tube is looped in the stomach. Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
