Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Right subclavian catheter tip is in the lower SVC. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacities are unchanged, larger on the right side. This could be atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Small bilateral pleural effusions previously seen are less conspicuous in this examination. There are no new lung abnormalities. There is mild vascular congestion. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
