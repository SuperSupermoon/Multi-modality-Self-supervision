1. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Persistent marked thoracolumbar scoliosis markedly distorting the thoracic cage. Lungs appear grossly clear. The cardiomediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the patient positioning on the current examination superimposed on the scoliosis. No evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
