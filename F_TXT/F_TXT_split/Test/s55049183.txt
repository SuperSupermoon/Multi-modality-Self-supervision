A pacemaker/ICD device with two leads appears unchanged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The pacer device overlaps persistent opacification of the left costophrenic angle that is probably unchanged, however, likely reflecting a combination of atelectasis and a small loculated pleural effusion. There is persistent thickening of the minor fissure with possible fluid and atelectasis with a small right-sided pleural effusion. Nodular suprahilar opacification on the right is associated with treated malignancy with an associated fiducial seed and appears stable. There is no pneumothorax. Free air is no longer apparent on this study.
