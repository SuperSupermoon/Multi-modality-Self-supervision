In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube with its tip in the body of the esophagus. The side hole is in the region of the gastroesophageal junction and the tube should be advanced several centimeters. Pulmonary vessels are less well defined than on the previous study, consistent with some mild increase in pulmonary venous pressure.
