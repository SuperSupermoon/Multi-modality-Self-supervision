The cardiac silhouette demonstrates borderline cardiomegaly. Atelectasis is noted at the right lung base. There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The diaphragms appear mildly flattened, and the lungs are hyperinflated, suggestive of COPD. Known granuloma is again noted within the left upper lobe. The aorta appears tortuous.
