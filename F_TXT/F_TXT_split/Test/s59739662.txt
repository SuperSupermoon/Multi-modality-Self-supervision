A left IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is present. As before, the tip lies relatively distal in the right pulmonary artery. Clinical correlation to assess for possible retraction is requested. A mesh-like stent extends along the expected course of the left subclavian and brachiocephalic vessels. Compared with the earlier film, there may have been slight interval improvement in the upper zone redistribution and vascular engorgement. Otherwise, no gross interval change is detected. Again seen is mild vascular prominence and opacity at the right base which is likely a combination of pleural fluid, possible elevated hemidiaphragm, and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is also increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a small left effusion. The left effusion is slightly more apparent on the current exam. No pneumothorax is detected.
