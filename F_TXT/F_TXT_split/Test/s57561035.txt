The cardiomediastinal contours show a mildly engorged azygous vein, but there is no pulmonary edema. There continues to be severely low lung volumes with chronic diaphragmatic elevation, more prominent on the left than the right, which obscures assessment of the heart and most of the lungs. The upper portions of the lungs are clear of consolidation. There is no pneumothorax. An anchor is noted in the right humeral head and a fracture through the proximal humeral neck is seen, similar in appearance to prior shoulder radiograph dated ___. The right AC joint continues to be widened.
