There is no evidence of left pneumothorax following the recent procedure. Left juxtahilar mass is again demonstrated with adjacent parenchymal opacities which likely represent post-obstructive atelectasis and pneumonia. As compared to the recent radiograph, the left upper lobe opacity appears more dense, possibly due to progressive post-obstructive abnormalities, but co-existing hemorrhage or aspiration are certainly possible in the setting of a recent procedure. Short-term followup radiograph may be helpful in this regard.
