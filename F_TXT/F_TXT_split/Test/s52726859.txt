AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of the prior day. During the examination interval, the patient has received a permanent pacer capsule now seen in left anterior axillary position being connected to two intravascular electrodes terminating in right atrial appendage and right ventricular apical portion position. The heart size is unchanged and remains within normal limits. The metallic structure of an aortic valve prosthesis is seen in place as before. Pulmonary vasculature is not congested, there are no new acute infiltrates and no pneumothorax is identified on either side.
