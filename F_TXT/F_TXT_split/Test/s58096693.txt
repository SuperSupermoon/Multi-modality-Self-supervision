A frontal view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated. Slightly increased retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis although infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. There is linear atelectasis in the left mid lung. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are stable allowing for patient position. No upper abdominal or osseous abnormality is identified.
