CHEST, TWO VIEWS. Compared with ___ at 7:41 a.m., the overall appearance is similar. Again seen are ET tube, an NG tube and right IJ line, all in nominal alignment. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is less prominent, but this is likely related to differences in technique. Hazy opacity at both lung bases and increased retrocardiac density are essentially unchanged. Upper zone redistribution is again noted.
