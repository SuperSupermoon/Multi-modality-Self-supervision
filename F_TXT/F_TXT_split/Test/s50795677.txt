Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Left subclavian line ends at mid SVC. Small lucency near the left lung apex could conceivably be a small pneumothorax, however, given the extent of bilateral severe subcutaneous emphysema, this may represent skin fold and moreover detection of small pneumothorax in this sitting is difficult. Otherwise, the overall extent of bilateral subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged. Multifocal lung opacities are similar. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
