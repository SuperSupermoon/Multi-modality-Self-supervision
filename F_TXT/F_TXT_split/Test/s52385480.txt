Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous film from earlier the same day at 12:59. New right IJ line is seen with tip projecting over the mid SVC. There is no visualized pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube is approximately 1.5 cm from the carina and should be withdrawn several centimeters for optimal positioning. Enteric tube is also slightly withdrawn with side port just proximal to the GE junction and should be advanced. Right mid lung surgical chain sutures again seen. Streaky right mid lung and left lung base opacities may be due to atelectasis. Fullness of the soft tissues in the right hilar region are seen, the etiology of which is uncertain. Given prior surgery there could be scarring or post-treatment changes, although underlying mass is possible, and dedicated imaging should be performed when patient is amenable. Mediastinal clips with median sternotomy wires again noted. Filter projecting over the IVC.
