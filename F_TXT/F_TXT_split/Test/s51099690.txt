1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the superior vena cava. A right basilar pigtail catheter has been placed and is incompletely visualized on the current examination. 2. Interval decrease in size of a right pleural effusion with residual patchy basilar opacity, which could reflect residual compressive atelectasis, reexpansion pulmonary edema, contusion, and less likely pneumonia. Persistent left pleural effusion with retrocardiac opacity, which most likely reflects partial lower lobe compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Heart remains enlarged. Cervical fusion hardware is seen projecting over the mid cervical spine.
