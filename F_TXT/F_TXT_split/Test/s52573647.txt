AP chest compared to ___. Moderate cardiomegaly has increased in size over the past three days following extubation. Greater opacity in the left mid lung laterally could be new pleural effusion or early consolidation, even mild asymmetric edema given severe and extensive lung scarring and pleural thickening and chronic areas of atelectasis which would tend to distribute edema in idiosyncratic fashion. Chronic engorgement of the mediastinal veins is also more pronounced today. No pneumothorax or layering pleural effusion is present.
