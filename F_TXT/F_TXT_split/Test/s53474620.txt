Single AP view of the chest. Postoperative changes again seen in the right thoracic cavity. Compared to prior, there appears to be less aerated lung on the right which could be due to enlarging effusion with possible underlying parenchymal abnormality. In addition, there is persistent left basilar opacity not significantly changed given differences in technique. Superiorly, the left lung remains clear. Right PICC and right pleural catheter are again noted.
