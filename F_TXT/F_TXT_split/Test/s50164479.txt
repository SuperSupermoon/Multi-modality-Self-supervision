CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. ET tube is present. The tip is obscured but appears to lie in satisfactory position above the carina. An orogastric-type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. Left IJ central line tip overlies proximal SVC. A dual-lumen right IJ catheter appears to overlie the distal SVC and SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax is detected. Suspect background COPD. Heart size is borderline with left ventricular configuration. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. There is increased retrocardiac opacity, with partial obscuration of the diaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Probable small left effusion. There is also a small right effusion with a small amount of associated collapse and/or consolidation. Compared with ___ at 14:24 p.m., the pleural-parenchymal findings are quite similar, possibly minimally improved at the right base. The radiopaque tip of the Dobhoff-type tube has been advanced and now extends off the film.
