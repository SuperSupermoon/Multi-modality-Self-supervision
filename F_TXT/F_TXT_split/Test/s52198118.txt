Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the day before. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. Mild interstitial edema is re-demonstrated associated with bilateral pleural effusions and left more than right basal opacities. Infection is a possibility, although atelectasis would be another alternative.
