Lung volumes are diminished which exaggerates the cardiomediastinal configuration. However, even accounting for this change, there has been a relative dramatic increase in the size of the cardiac silhouette with now somewhat globular morphology. Ill-defined opacity is noted in the retrocardiac left lower lobe which is likely atelectasis given the volume loss. There is no focal consolidation. No definite effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The osseous structures are unremarkable. Incidental note is made of internal fixation hardware, incompletely evaluated, involving the mid diaphysis of the right clavicle. Tubing loops over the epigastric region and with the tip projecting at the dome of the left hemidiaphragm over the cardiac silhouette.
