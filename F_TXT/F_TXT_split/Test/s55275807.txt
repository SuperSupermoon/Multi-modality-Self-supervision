Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Since the prior study, there is slight improvement in the perihilar opacities with still present lower lobe opacities with slightly more confluent area in the right lower lobe. These findings overall are still concerning for interstitial pulmonary edema. There is a possibility of underlying metastatic disease that cannot be assessed on the current examination except for known right middle lobe nodular opacity projecting on the radiograph as well.
