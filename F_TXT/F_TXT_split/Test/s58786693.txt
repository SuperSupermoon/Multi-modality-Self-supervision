Lung volumes are low which accentuates bronchovascular markings and the transverse diameter of the heart. Given that, the heart is top-normal to minimally enlarged. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged and there is mild edema. A right basal opacity suggests atelectasis however infection should be considered. No pleural effusion is identified. The left lung is clear.
