As compared to the previous radiograph, a pigtail was introduced into the right pleural cavity. The major part of the pre-existing right pleural effusion appears to be drained. However, a new air inclusion in the right basal pleural space. This pleural air does not manifest as an apical pneumothorax. In fact, in the apical and lateral parts of the right hemithorax, there is still abundant fluid visualized. The volume of the right hemithorax, overall, has not increased. However, a short-term followup is required to assess for potential developing tension. Normally appearing lung parenchyma on the left. Unchanged left heart border and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
