There are persistent and slightly worsening opacities in the left upper and mid lung and right lower lung which would be concerning either for worsening edema or pneumonia. Chain sutures are again identified abutting the minor fissure consistent with prior surgery. Bilateral effusions, left greater than right, are again seen. Persistent retrocardiac opacity may reflect compressive atelectasis, although infection in this region cannot be excluded. The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG, but assessment of cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult due to the patient's marked rotation on the current examination. Left internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the mid SVC. Linear calcifications in the left upper hemithorax are felt to likely be pleural in etiology. A portion of the inferior vena caval filter is imaged at the edge of the study.
