Comparison is made to the prior study performed at 4:35 a.m. on ___. There is a right-sided catheter with the distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. There is a left IJ central venous line with the distal lead tip in the mid SVC. The endotracheal tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina. The feeding tube whose distal tip is below the GE junction. These tubes are all unchanged in position. There is stable cardiomegaly. There is mild improved aeration at the lung bases. There remain bilateral pleural effusions. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces.
