There has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube, which is coiled within the pharynx. There is a left-sided PICC line with tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction. There is interval removal of the right-sided central venous sheath. No pneumothorax evident. There is stable small right pleural effusion. Right lower lung opacification likely represents combination of atelectasis and layering pleural effusion. Stable calcified granuloma projects over right mid lung. A nodular opacity projecting over left upper lung corresponds with nipple evident on the ___, chest CT.
