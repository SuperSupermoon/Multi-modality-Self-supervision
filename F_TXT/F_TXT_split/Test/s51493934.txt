AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made to the next preceding portable chest examinations of ___. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. Same holds for the right internal jugular approach double-lumen catheter terminating in the mid portion of the SVC. Heart size is enlarged as before. The most significant interval change in comparison with the preceding studies is a markedly increased perivascular haze, peripheral Kerley B lines on the bases, and beginning central edema around the hilar areas. No significant amount of pleural effusion can be identified in the lateral pleural sinuses, nor is there any pneumothorax in the apical area.
