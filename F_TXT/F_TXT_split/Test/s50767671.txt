AP chest compared to ___ at 9:19 p.m.: Tip of the newly positioned endotracheal tube is in standard placement roughly 4 cm above the carina. Overlying apparatus obscures the upper lungs, but pulmonary vascular engorgement in the apices has worsened appreciably, accompanied by increase in moderate cardiomegaly, all suggesting cardiac decompensation, perhaps in the setting of hypotension. There is no florid pulmonary edema, large pleural effusion or any indication of pneumothorax. Upper enteric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
