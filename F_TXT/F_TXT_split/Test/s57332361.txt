The patient is status post median sternotomy. Right-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen without significant change in position, terminating at the cavoatrial junction. Again, there are low lung volumes and minimal bibasilar atelectasis. Ovoid calcification projecting over the left mediastinum is again seen. Subcentimeter left lower lung rounded calcification is stable and may represent a calcified granuloma. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
