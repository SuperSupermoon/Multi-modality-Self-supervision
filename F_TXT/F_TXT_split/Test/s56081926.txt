Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Transvenous pacemaker leads are in unchanged standard position. ET tube tip is 3.6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Left lower lobe opacity has worsened, consistent with worsening atelectasis and small left pleural effusion. Right lower lobe opacity has increased consistent with increasing right lower lobe atelectasis. If any, there is a small right pleural effusion. Moderate pulmonary edema is stable.
