Left PICC is unchanged in position compared to the prior radiograph. It enters via a left-sided approach, and makes a vertical descent at the level of the aortic arch, in keeping with known left-sided superior vena cava. The tip of the catheter continues to terminate just above the level of the diaphragm to the left of midline, and could be withdrawn approximately 8 cm to ensure positioning within the lower left superior vena cava. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Moderate right pleural effusion with subpulmonic component has slightly increased in size. Adjacent area of opacity within the right middle and lower lobe has also slightly worsened.
