Comparison is made to the prior study performed two hours earlier. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube, whose distal tip and sideport are below the gastroesophageal junction. Endotracheal tube and right IJ central line are in unchanged position. There is persistent cardiomegaly. There is a left retrocardiac opacity. There is prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings, consistent with mild pulmonary edema. There is some atelectasis at the left lung base.
