As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone a right thoracocentesis. The extent of the right pleural effusion has substantially decreased. There is an opacity at the right lung base, likely reflecting reexpansion lung edema. No evidence of pneumothorax. No change in appearance of the left lung and of the cardiac silhouette.
