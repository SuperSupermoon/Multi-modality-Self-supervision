The heart shows stable cardiomegaly. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The previously described left mid upper lung opacity has improved in appearance. The left lower lobe consolidation appears similar. Subtle blunting of the left costophrenic angle may also indicate a trace amount of pleural fluid in that locale. There is no pneumothorax.
