AP chest compared to ___: Right lung is entirely airless, function of worsening pleural effusion and atelectasis. Severe opacification of the left lung has a distinctly nodular quality which could be due to collections of fluid in bullae, or multiple septic emboli. Heart is enlarged but hard to assess because the right border is obscured by pleural and parenchymal abnormalities in the right chest. Right jugular line ends over the region of the low SVC. No pneumothorax. Findings were discussed by telephone with the house officer caring for this patient at the time of dictation.
