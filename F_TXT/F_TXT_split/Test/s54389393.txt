Single portable view of the chest. Bibasilar opacities with blunting of the costophrenic angles which could be due to effusions. There are indistinct pulmonary vascular markings. Relatively lentiform-shaped opacity over the right mid lung is suggestive of fluid within the fissure. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, similar to prior. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted.
