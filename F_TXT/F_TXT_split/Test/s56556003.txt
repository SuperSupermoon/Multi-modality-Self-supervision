In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion with asymmetric edema, more prominent on the right. Retrocardiac opacification with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe. There may well be small bilateral pleural effusions.
