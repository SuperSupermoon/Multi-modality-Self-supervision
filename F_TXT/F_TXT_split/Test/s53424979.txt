Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which accentuate bronchovascular markings. There is near-complete resolution of bilateral pleural effusions seen on ___ exam. There is no pneumothorax or focal consolidation. Streaky opacity in the left juxtahilar region along with mild prominence of the pulmonary vascularity likely reflects mild interstitial edema, which is improved compared to the prior study. Heart is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contour is slightly widened, which is most likely due to low lung volumes and patient positioning. Post-surgical changes related to median sternotomy and CABG are again noted.
