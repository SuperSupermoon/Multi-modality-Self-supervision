Position of the endotracheal tube is unchanged. The exact position of the nasogastric tube cannot be determined on current chest x-ray but appears to be in a satisfactory position on the recently obtained chest CT. Tip of the endotracheal tube currently lies 4.2 cm from the carinal angle. The lung fields remain clear.
