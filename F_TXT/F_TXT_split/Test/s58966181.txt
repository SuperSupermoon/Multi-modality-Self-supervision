An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position with the tip terminating 45 mm above the carina. A left-sided PICC line is unchanged in position with the tip projecting over the cavoatrial junction. A right internal jugular large-bore central catheter is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the right atrium. An OG tube is in appropriate position. Bilateral pleural pigtail catheters are unchanged in position in the lower lobes. Increased opacification in the left lower lobe could be a combination of left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis or in the appropriate clinical setting, focal consolidation. A small right-sided pleural effusion is stable with persistent opacity in the peripheral right lower lobe most likely atelectasis. The patient is status post median sternotomy with an atrial valve prosthesis consistent with Bentall procedure. The mediastinal contours are stable. The cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged with an apparent gradual increase in size from prior studies which is concerning for pericardial effusion.
