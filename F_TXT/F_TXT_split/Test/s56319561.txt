There has been some interval improved aeration in the left upper lobe that now permits visualization of the aortic knob and the previously described appearance of question widened mediastinum is now seen to have represented the left upper lobe infiltrate. There continues to be a dense left upper lobe infiltrate with more hazy opacity of the remainder of the left lung that could be due in part to layering effusion. There are increased patchy areas of infiltrate in the right lung. There is pulmonary vascular re-distribution and ill-defined vasculature consistent with fluid overload. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the main pulmonary artery. The ET tube is 4 cm above the carina. Left chest tube and mediastinal drains are unchanged. The dual-lead pacemaker is unchanged.
