Lung volumes are low, despite endotracheal intubation. There is worsening engorgement of the mediastinal vasculature and central pulmonary vascular congestion. There is also new mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The endotracheal tube is in appropriate position approximately 5 cm above the carina. A hemodialysis catheter terminates in the cavoatrial junction.
