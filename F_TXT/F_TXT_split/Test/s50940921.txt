As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting increased ventilatory pressure. The pre-existing combination of a right parenchymal opacity and diffusion has decreased in extent and severity. The retrocardiac lung parenchyma has also slightly increased in transparency. No evidence of new parenchymal opacities. A left pleural effusion is not present. In the left perihilar areas, there is minimal peribronchial cuffing and an increase in diameter of the vascular structures, so that mild pulmonary edema cannot be excluded.
