Comparison is made to prior study from ___. Endotracheal tube has been removed. There remains a left IJ central venous line with the distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. There are diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally, more confluent within the right lung. Findings are consistent with pulmonary edema, although multifocal pneumonia should also be considered.
