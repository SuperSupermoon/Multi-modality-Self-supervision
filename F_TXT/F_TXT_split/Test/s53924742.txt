There is a new large confluent consolidation within the right upper lung, findings concerning for pneumonia given the clinical history in immunocompromised state of the patient. The exact lobar distribution is difficult to assess on this single frontal view only. The remainder of the lungs is clear. There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or pleural effusions. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior.
