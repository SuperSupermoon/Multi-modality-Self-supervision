There is a smaller right pleural effusion with associated right basilar atelectasis. Pulmonary edema is improved. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is unchanged, the mediastinal contours are normal. A right IJ catheter tip is unchanged projecting over the lower SVC. Median sternotomy wires, and mitral valve prosthesis are unchanged.
