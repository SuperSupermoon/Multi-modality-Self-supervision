Minimally displaced right-sided rib fractures appear similar compared to prior trauma radiographs from ___ and are better characterized on followup CT torso from the same day. Known left-sided rib fractures are also better characterized on prior CT. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Linear opacities in the lung bases correspond with known subsegmental atelectasis including increased left basilar opacity since the prior radiographs. The left upper lung appears better aerated, however. New mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggestive of developing small bilateral pleural effusions. A known manubrium fracture is not well characterized on this single frontal view. Mediastinal contours appear similar compared to recent prior suggesting probable stability of the known retrosternal hematoma. Hilar and cardiac contours are within normal limits. Cervical spinal hardware is incompletely imaged. There has been interval placement of probable epidural catheter in the mid thoracic spine.
