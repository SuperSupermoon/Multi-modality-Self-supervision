Pleural effusion, moderate on the right, smaller on the left, has increased since ___:41. There has also been an increase in the moderately severe, generalized but asymmetric infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, worse in the right lung than the left. Moderate widening of the mediastinum primarily in the right lower paratracheal station is most likely due to dilated central veins. All these findings could be due to volume related pulmonary edema, perhaps with a neurogenic component. If this interpretation does not fit the clinical situation, pulmonary reaction to administered drugs or blood products should be considered, and finally widespread aspiration pneumonia. If at all possible upright and lateral radiographs would be very helpful in determining the relative contributions of pleural effusion and pulmonary abnormality. . Heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax.
