Compared to prior examination, there has been increase in subcutaneous gas tracking along the right hemithorax and now extending to the neck. There is also unusually sharp demarcation of the right heart border with a thin rim of lucency near the cardiophrenic angle which may suggest a medial component of pneumothorax. These findings in conjunction are worrisome for a left chest tube. There is otherwise no change with persistent low lung volumes with associated atelectasis and mild vascular congestion.
