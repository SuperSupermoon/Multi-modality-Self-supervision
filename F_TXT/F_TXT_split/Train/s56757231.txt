Left-sided pacer unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified on the current study. Interval removal of the right internal jugular dual-lumen catheter. Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Interval appearance of bilateral diffuse parenchymal process favoring moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema; an infectious process would be less likely. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
