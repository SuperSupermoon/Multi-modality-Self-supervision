Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier at 5:58 p.m. Since the prior study, there is no substantial change in the basal and apical components of the pneumothorax, but the lateral component appears to be mildly increased with subsequent worsening of the right basal opacity. The rest of the findings are unchanged.
