AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 4:11 p.m. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal consolidations are redemonstrated, although minimally improved as compared to the prior examination. The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. The right PICC line is currently pointing upwards cranially and should be considered reposition.
