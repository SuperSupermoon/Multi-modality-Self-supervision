As compared to the previous image, there is evidence of increasing radiodensity in the right lung apex. Part of this observation might be caused by rotation of the patient. However, coexisting developing pneumonia might also be present. Short term radiographic followup is recommended. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. Mild cardiomegaly and postoperative appearance of the left lung base is constant.
