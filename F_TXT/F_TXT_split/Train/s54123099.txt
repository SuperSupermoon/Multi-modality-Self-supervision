AP portable upright view of the chest provided. The patient is slightly rotated to the left. There is increased opacity in the right lung base which is concerning for pneumonia. In addition, there is retrocardiac opacity, mostly in a linear configuration, which could represent atelectasis, less likely pneumonia/aspiration. A few scattered more nodular-appearing opacities are seen in the mid-to-upper lungs, at least one of which likely represents an EKG related to sternal artifact. No pneumothorax is seen. No large effusion. Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures appear intact.
