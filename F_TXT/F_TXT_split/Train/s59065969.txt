Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Left sided triple-lead AICD is unchanged in position. The lung volumes are slightly decreased. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Bibasilar opacities likely representing chronic atelectasis/scarring are stable. The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image and a small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. There is trace blunting of the left costophrenic angle and a trace left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
