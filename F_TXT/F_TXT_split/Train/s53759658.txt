The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including mild cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration to the heart. There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may reflect a subpulmonic effusion. There is a new mild interstitial opacity suggesting pulmonary edema in addition to a vague but focal lateral right apical opacity, the latter unchanged.
