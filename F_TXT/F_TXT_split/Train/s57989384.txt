Subtle left basilar opacity likely corresponds to atelectasis/possible pulmonary contusion as seen on CT earlier today. No large pleural effusion is seen. There are no findings to suggest pneumothorax. There are multiple left-sided rib fractures, better assessed on CT, however, 1 reasonably well seen involves the posterior left 4th rib is, which is minimally displaced. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
