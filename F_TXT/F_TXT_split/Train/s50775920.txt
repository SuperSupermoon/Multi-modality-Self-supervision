Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications and is unfolded. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Moderate size hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis or aspiration. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a small right pleural effusion. No large left pleural effusion is demonstrated. No pneumothorax is identified. S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is again seen. A percutaneous feeding tube is seen within the left mid abdomen.
