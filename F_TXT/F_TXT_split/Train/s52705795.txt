Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval exchange of a left-sided pleural catheter with large apical pneumothorax extending to at least the level of the fifth rib. There is no appreciable mediastinal shift. The previously seen left-sided Port-a-Cath and esophageal stent remain in unchanged standard position. The previously seen right pleural effusion is similar in appearance to prior study. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
