Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of a left-sided pacer device with a lead seen extending to the expected location of the right ventricle and the coronary sinus. There may also be a lead extending to the right ventricle, although this is not well seen on the current study. Right lower hemithorax opacity is seen which may be due to underlying subpulmonic effusion with overlying atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded. Findings may also be due to elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. If patient able, suggest dedicated PA and lateral views for better evaluation. There is prominence and indistinctness of the hila. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Patient is status post median sternotomy.
