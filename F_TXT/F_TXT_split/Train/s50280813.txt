In comparison with study of ___, there has been a right pneumonectomy with the hemithorax filled with gas. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is seen. Subcutaneous gas is seen along the right lateral chest wall extending into the neck. There is substantial obliquity of the patient, which may account for much, if not all, of the apparent shift of the mediastinum to the right. The left lung is clear.
