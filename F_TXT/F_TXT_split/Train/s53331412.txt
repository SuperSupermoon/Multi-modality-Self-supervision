Tip of the endotracheal tube terminates 6.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is also in place, but tip is not confidently visualized on this exam. Left internal jugular catheter continues to terminate in left brachiocephalic vein. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for rightward patient's rotation. As compared to prior study, interstitial edema has improved, and an area of peripheral consolidation at the right lung apex is no longer visualized. Otherwise, no relevant changes.
