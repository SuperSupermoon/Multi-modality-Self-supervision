The lung volumes are normal. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusion. In both upper lobes, right more than left, there are subtle but relatively diffuse parenchymal opacities that could suggest past or recent infection. The opacities are predominantly nodular in appearance, with some linear components. Comparison with potential previous radiographs would be helpful for further assessment. If active infection is suspected, the patient should probably undergo CT for a better evaluation of the lung apices. No pleural effusions. No cardiomegaly, no pulmonary edema.
