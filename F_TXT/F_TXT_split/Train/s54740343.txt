A very large right pleural effusion has increased in size from the prior radiograph, and occupies almost the entirety of the right hemithorax with only a small amount of residual aerated right upper lobe at the apex. A small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has only slightly increased in size from the prior radiograph and is associated with adjacent atelectasis at the left lung base.
