The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the upper superior vena cava. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably unchanged allowing for differences in technique. There is new mild to moderate central vascular hilar congestion and, at the left lung base, volume loss with a new pleural effusion probably including atelectasis. Known carcinoma is not visible on this study.
