CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW Compared with the film from ___ at 5:18 a.m., no gross change is identified. Again seen is a left-sided PIC line with tip over mid SVC. Also again seen are diffuse, somewhat patchy ,bilateral opacities. On the current exam, the left hemidiaphragm is less well seen, consistent with interval obscuration/increased left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, though the degree of opacity in the left mid zone is slightly improved. The patient is status post sternotomy. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
