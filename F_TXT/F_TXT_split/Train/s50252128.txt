AP supine portable chest radiograph obtained. There is a left IJ central venous catheter with its tip in the expected level of the superior vena cava. There is opacity at the left lung base which could reflect consolidation and/or effusion. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which appears chronic. There is associated right lung base atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen. Heart size appears stable. Clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
