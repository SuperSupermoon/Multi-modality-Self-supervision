As compared to yesterday, there is reduction of the opacification in the mid and lower right lung for improvement of the mildpulmonary edema. Rounded scattered opacities are now clearly visible at the lung bases, especially on the right. Hyperlucency of the right upper lobe is for emphysema. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
