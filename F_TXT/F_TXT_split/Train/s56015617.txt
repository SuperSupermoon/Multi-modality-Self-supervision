Lung volumes are low. Patchy and linear opacities at both lung bases with associated volume loss favor atelectasis over an infectious pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique. Questionable small pleural effusions, difficult to assess in the setting of low volumes and portable technique.
