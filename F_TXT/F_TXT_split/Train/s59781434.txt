The endotracheal tube terminates in position 3.5 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm. Lung volumes are low causing crowding of the central bronchovascular structures, and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is noted. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal in size, and no definite pleural effusion, focal consolidation or overt pulmonary edema is seen.
