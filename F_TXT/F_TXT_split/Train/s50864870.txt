The heart is mildly enlarged. The central pulmonary vasculature is minimally prominent which may suggest fluid overload, but without frank congestive heart failure. A more focal opacity is present in the right lower lung, probably in the right lower lobe. In the setting of low clinical concern for pneumonia, this appearance can probably be attributed to atelectasis but is not specific. Minimal blunting is noted along each costophrenic sulcus; since these do not appear sharp, there may be very small pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
