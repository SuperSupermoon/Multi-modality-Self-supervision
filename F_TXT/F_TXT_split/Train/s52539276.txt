AP upright portable chest radiograph provided. Multiple overlying leads are present which somewhat limit the evaluation. The heart appears mildly enlarged. Also noted is left basilar opacity which likely in part reflects the presence of a left pleural effusion with left lower lobe consolidation difficult to exclude. There is small right pleural effusion with right basilar atelectasis. The heart is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contour is widened though the aorta appears tortuous. No convincing signs of pneumothorax. The bony structures are intact.
