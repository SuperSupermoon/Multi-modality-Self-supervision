1. Status post median sternotomy with overall stable post-operative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Right-sided pacemaker remains in place with its lead terminating over the expected location of the right ventricle. A right internal jugular introducer has its tip in the distal internal jugular vein, unchanged in position. A feeding tube is only seen to level of the mid esophagus but likely courses below the diaphragm, although this is difficult to ascertain due to the technique used on the current examination. Post-operative cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable status post median sternotomy. Persistent patchy bibasilar airspace opacity and likely layering effusions which probably represents compressive atelectasis. Interval improvement in the mild interstitial edema. Improving bilateral subcutaneous emphysema. Small right apical pneumothorax is stable.
