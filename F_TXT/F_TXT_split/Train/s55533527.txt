Chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___. In addition to chronic left perihilar consolidation in large mucoid impaction distal to the hilar mass, despite the left bronchial stent there is now considerably more atelectasis in the left lower lobe accompanied by increasing small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Detail in the right lung is obscured by respiratory motion, but I am not sure I see any more than vascular congestion. Heart is obscured.
