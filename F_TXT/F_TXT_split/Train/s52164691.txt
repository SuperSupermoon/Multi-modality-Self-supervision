There is a right-sided IJ which terminates in the low SVC. Overall, there appears to be slight interval increase in the opacity projecting over the left hemithorax with opacification of the left lung base and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. The right lung base opacity appears to have minimally improved in the interim. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
