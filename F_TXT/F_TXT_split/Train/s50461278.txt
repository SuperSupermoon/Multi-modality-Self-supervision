Compared to most recent prior exam, there has been little interval change. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is enlarged. Prominent interstitial markings, most notable at the lung bases, persist. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. No other consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. Blunting of the costophrenic angles were seen previously and may be due to chronic changes or technique rather than effusions, but small effusions cannot be excluded on frontal view only. Sternal wires appear intact. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
