Lung volumes are mildly diminished. A linear opacity in the left lower lung could be a band of atelectasis or left-sided minor fissure. A 6 mm wide curvilinear opacity projecting to the right of the hilus superiorly and over the hilus inferiorly is very unusual. It could be a chronic middle lobe collapse or an unusual band of sublobar atelectasis. Lateral view might be helpful. Any prior chest radiograph should be consulted. Heart size is top-normal. There is no pleural abnormality.
