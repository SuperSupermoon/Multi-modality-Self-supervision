Single portable view of the chest. Minimal left basilar opacity is seen potentially due to atelectasis or prominent fat pad. The lungs are otherwise clear noting low lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged but likely accentuated by PA technique and low lung volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable. No acute osseous abnormality detected. Resorption of the distal right clavicle, potentially posttraumatic but old.
