As compared to the previous radiograph, a part of the previously aspirated left pleural effusion has re-accumulated, causing blunting of the costophrenic sinus on the left. There is no evidence of pneumothorax after aspiration. On the right, there is hypoventilation of the middle lobe, potentially associated with minimally increasing right pleural effusion. Given that the lung volumes have overall decreased, the diameter of the cardiac silhouette has slightly increased and the patient now shows minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. Moderate tortuosity of the aorta persists. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position.
