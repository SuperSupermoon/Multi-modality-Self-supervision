In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the left pigtail catheter has been removed. No definite pneumothorax, though the apical region is obscured by overlying material. The increased opacification at the bases has substantially decreased. Is unclear whether this represents true improvement in the pleural fluid and compressive basilar atelectasis, or merely a more erect position of the patient. There appears to be a new tracheostomy tube in place.
