A Dobbhoff tube has been advanced, though still in relatively high position with the tip just beyond the gastroesophageal junction and could be advanced for more optimal placement. The remainder of the examination is unchanged. The lungs are grossly clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits.
