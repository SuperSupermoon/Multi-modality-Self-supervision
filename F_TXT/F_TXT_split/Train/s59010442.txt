Right subclavian catheter tip is in the cavoatrial junction. There is no evident pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Opacity in the right base has improved consistent with improving atelectasis and decrease in small right effusion. Retrocardiac opacities have increased consistent with increasing consolidation adjacent to the small stable pleural effusion, this consolidation could be atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
