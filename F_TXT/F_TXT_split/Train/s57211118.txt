In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been removed and the right IJ catheter is unchanged. The extensive widening of the superior mediastinum seen previously is much less on the current study. Nevertheless, if there is serious consideration for postoperative mediastinal bleeding, CT should be obtained. Continued increased opacification at the left base consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. Less prominent atelectasis and possible effusion is seen at the right base. No definite pneumoperitoneum is appreciated on the current study, though small amounts of gas would be detectable only on CT.
