There is a single lead pacemaker. There is a large bore central line with tip probably in the SVC but it is difficult visualize sternal wires and mediastinal clips are seen. There is a slightly nodular appearance to the right hilum. Is unclear if this due to vasculature or adenopathy. There is no focal infiltrate.
