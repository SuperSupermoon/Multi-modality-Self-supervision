Widespread bilateral alveolar opacities with a central predominance are new compared to the prior chest x-ray, and are accompanied by scattered septal lines in the lung periphery. Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured by the alveolar opacities but is likely slightly increased in size compared to the prior radiograph even allowing for differences in technical factors between the exams. Azygous vein is slightly distended.
