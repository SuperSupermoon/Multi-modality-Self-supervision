Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality in the left lung and postoperative right lung has progressed over the past 3 weeks. The interstitial quality of this abnormality is very suggestive of pneumocystis or pulmonary toxicity to medication. The chronic postoperative pleural collection at the apex of the right chest is unchanged, and a moderate left pleural effusion persists. Heart is normal size. There is no pneumothorax. Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC.
