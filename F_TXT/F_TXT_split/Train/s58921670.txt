A portable semi-upright chest radiograph shows an endotracheal tube in place with the tip 4 cm above the carina, unchanged from an oblique study from two days ago. Right pleural effusion and patchy bilateral airspace consolidation persists. A left-sided internal jugular central venous catheter is seen with the tip just reaching the proximal SVC. Note is made of an ovoid air collection in the right mid lung zone within which soft tissue density is suggested, better evaluated on images from an outside chest CT from ___.
