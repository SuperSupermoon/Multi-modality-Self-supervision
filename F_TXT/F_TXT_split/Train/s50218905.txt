In comparison with the study of ___, a dense area of platelike atelectasis is again seen in the left mid zone with smaller streaks at the base. Areas of atelectasis are also seen on the right. There is the suggestion of an ill-defined area of increased opacification adjacent to the descending portion of the right pulmonary artery. Although this could also merely represent atelectatic change, in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
