Allowing for differences in positioning, lines and tubes are similar in appearance. Again noted is the pigtail-type catheter at the right lung base. A prominent gastric air bubble is also again noted. No pneumothorax is detected. Although the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears slightly more pronounced, this may be relate to differences in positioning. There is upper zone redistribution, similar to the prior study. Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with suspected small left effusion. Small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. Patchy opacity at the right base is again noted. Possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, but no obvious right pleural effusion.
