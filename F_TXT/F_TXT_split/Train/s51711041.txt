Since a recent study of earlier today, the patient has been in dictated, with tip of tube terminating near the carina. Nasogastric tube terminates in the region of the gastroduodenal junction. Exam is otherwise remarkable for slight interval worsening of widespread alveolar and nodular opacities which remain more severe in the right lung than the left. More confluent opacity in the right middle lobe on the prior study has improved. Moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion are unchanged.
