As compared to the previous radiograph, the transparency of the lung parenchyma has minimally increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The monitoring and support devices are constant. However, the overall extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities is still severe. Small pleural effusions bilaterally, right more than left, constant in appearance. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
