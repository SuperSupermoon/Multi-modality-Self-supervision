Endotracheal tube lies approximately 4 cm above the carina. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal given portable technique. Lungs are relatively well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, pneumothorax or evidence of pulmonary edema. There is a 1.5 cm nodular opacity overlying the fifth left anterior lateral rib. The location of this nodular opacity cannot be ascertained on this single image, but a pulmonary nodule cannot be entirely excluded. Therefore, comparison to more remote radiographs may be helpful. In their absence, followup imaging with PA and lateral views once the patient clinically stabilizes or a dedicated chest CT could be performed. No pneumothorax.
