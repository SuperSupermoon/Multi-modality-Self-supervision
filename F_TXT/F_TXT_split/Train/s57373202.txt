A single portable frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. Lung volumes are slightly low, causing bronchovascular crowding. Streaky opacities at both lung bases are likely atelectasis, although early infection could have a similar appearance. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal. There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.
