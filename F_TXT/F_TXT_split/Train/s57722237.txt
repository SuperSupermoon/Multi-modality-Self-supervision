Chest tubes have been removed from each hemithorax. Lines, tubes and drains appear otherwise unchanged. There is a new moderate pneumothorax on the right. The pleural edge is retracted from the chest wall by about 3.5 cm. There was already mild shift of mediastinal structures to the left associated with volume loss, probably related to retrocardiac opacification suggesting substantial left lower lobe atelectasis, but the degree of shift is unchanged. There is a small pneumothorax on the left, probably unchanged. Small pleural effusions are difficult to exclude. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.
