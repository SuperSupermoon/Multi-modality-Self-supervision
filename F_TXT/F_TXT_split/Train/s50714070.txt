The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Enteric tube is unchanged in position. Bronchovascular markings are accentuated by very low lung volumes. There is decreased opacification of the left hemithorax, which may reflect improving pleural effusion or semi-erect positioning. There is also left lung base atelectasis. No new areas of consolidation. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities.
