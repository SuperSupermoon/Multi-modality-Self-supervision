AP chest compared to ___ at 11:33 p.m.: Large right pneumothorax is even larger with new leftward mediastinal shift despite a pigtail catheter projecting over the right lower hemithorax. The catheter is not functional and on a single view I cannot document its location. Decrease in cardiac size suggests there may be further interference with right heart filling due to hemodynamic tension. Endotracheal tube is in standard placement but the caliber appears small for the size of the trachea. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. Mild pulmonary edema persists and there is progressive atelectasis at the base of the left lung probably a function of shifted mediastinum. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. These findings were discussed fully with Dr. ___ by telephone at 9:50 a.m., one minute following their recognition. A chest radiograph has been ordered and I instructed her to telephone the radiology department to obtain the study on a super stat basis.
