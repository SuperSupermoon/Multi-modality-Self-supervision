The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including bilateral hilar prominence, particularly on the right, where it may partly reflect atelectasis associatd with marked relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Opacification of the left costophrenic sulcus suggests minor atelectasis, although small coinciding pleural effusions are difficult to exclude. There is no pneumothorax.
