Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Left-sided Port-A-Cath is stable in position. There is a grossly stable small right apical pneumothorax. Lucency projecting over the region of the minor fissure may represent a loculated component of pneumothorax. Perihilar opacities are again seen. Bibasilar opacities are again seen, possibly minimally improved in the right base. Left base opacity likely representd a combination of pleural effusion, atelectasis and possible consolidation appears mildly increased with an increase in left upper lung opacity which may be due to asymmetric edema or layering pleural effusion. Patient's known multiple pulmonary nodules are better seen on CT.
