As compared to the previous radiograph, the amount of intra-abdominal air has minimally decreased in extent. The lung volumes remain low. The cardiac silhouette continues to be enlarged and bilateral parenchymal opacities are visualized, mainly perihilar in distribution, with the symmetry of the changes suggesting centralized pulmonary edema. However, aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded. The monitoring and support devices continue to be in correct position.
