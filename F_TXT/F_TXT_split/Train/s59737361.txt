Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. The tip is 4.6 cm above the carina. There is no evident pneumothorax. There are no acute interval changes. Diffuse bilateral left greater than right lung opacities with loss of volume in the left lung are stable. Left subclavian catheter tip remains in the right atrium. Right chest tube is in place.
