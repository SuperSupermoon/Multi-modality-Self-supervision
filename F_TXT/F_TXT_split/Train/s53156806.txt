Lordotic positioning. An ET tube is present, tip lies 5.4 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip and side-port lie beneath the diaphragm overlying the gastric fundus. Apparent temperature probe is also seen adjacent to the tip of the ET tube. A left chest tube is in place, with tip near the left lung apex. The patient has a known tiny left apical pneumothorax that is obscured by overlying bones on this study. On the right, no obvious pneumothorax. Again seen is extensive opacification of the left lung, most pronounced in the lower and, to a lesser extent, mid zones, compatible with a combination of lung contusion and aspiration. Possibility of a small left effusion cannot be excluded There are coarsened markings the right cardiophrenic region which could reflect either aspiration or atelectasis. No other focal infiltrate on the right. No gross effusion. . The patient has multiple known fracturesabout the chest, only some a which are readily apparent on this study. .
