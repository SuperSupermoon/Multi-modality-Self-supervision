Comparison is made with the prior chest x-ray, ___ and chest CT, ___. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube remains low with tip just 10 mm above the carina. It could be withdrawn a couple of centimeters for more standard position. Left IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Opacities in the right lung have increased, consistent with increasing in moderate right pleural effusion and multifocal pneumonia, larger in the right perihilar region and right lower lobe. Increasing opacities in the left lower lobe is also consistent with worsening pneumonia. The amount of pleural effusion cannot be accessed. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
