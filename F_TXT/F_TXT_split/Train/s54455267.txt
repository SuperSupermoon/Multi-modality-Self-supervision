Since ___, left PICC has been removed. Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion. Diffuse pleural calcifications are again demonstrated consistent with previous asbestos exposure. Bilateral pleural thickening and or pleural effusions are again demonstrated. No definite superimposed pneumonia or aspiration, but the diffuse subpleural abnormalities limits assessment of the underlying lung parenchyma, particularly in the left upper hemi thorax. Consider a PA and lateral chest radiograph for more complete assessment when the patient's condition permits.
