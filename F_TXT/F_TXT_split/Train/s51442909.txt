AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Marked cardiomegaly as before. Permanent pacer in left axillary position with two intracavitary electrodes. Their position corresponds to the apical portion of the right ventricle and right atrial appendage respectively. The position of the electrodes indicates marked widening of the right atrium. The pulmonary vasculature is now again more congested than on the next previous examination, and in addition, the lateral pleural sinuses are now again blunted indicating bilateral pleural effusions. A diffuse hazy _____ density overlying the right lower-most lung field is suspicious for some infiltrate, and additional aspiration pneumonitis should be considered.
