AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Pulmonary edema is mild, if any. Opacification of the base of the left lung has been present for several days, probably atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding, but what is most striking is enlargement of the left pulmonary artery, which has exceeded and persisted beyond that of the right pulmonary artery. Since this is sometimes a sign of pulmonary embolus that diagnosis should be considered and will be discussed with house officer caring for this patient. Tip of the ET tube is approximately 9 cm above the carina, 5 cm above standard position. Enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Dr. ___ was paged at 10:55 a.m., one minute following recognition of the findings, which we discussed five minutes later.
