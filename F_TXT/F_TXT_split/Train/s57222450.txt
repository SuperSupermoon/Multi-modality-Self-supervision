Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, with endotracheal tube terminating about 2.3 cm above the carina with the neck in a flexed position. Heterogeneous opacities persist in both lungs with relative sparing of the left upper lobe. As compared to the recent exam of one day earlier, there are worsening opacities in both lung bases as well as the development of a small left pleural effusion. The etiology of these findings is uncertain, but they are concerning for multifocal infection in the appropriate clinical setting. Outside of the chest, note is made of dense calcifications in the expected location of the right carotid artery.
