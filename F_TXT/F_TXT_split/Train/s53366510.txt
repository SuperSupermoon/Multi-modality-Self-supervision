As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient was extubated. A hyperlucent line at the level of the right lung apex is a skin fold. There currently is no evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax. Small right pleural effusion and left retrocardiac atelectasis as well as moderate cardiomegaly are unchanged.
