AP chest compared to ___: Leftward shift of the persistently enlarged cardiac silhouette suggests volume loss in the left lower lobe has progressed. Moderate right pleural effusion and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema are unchanged. No pneumothorax. ET tube ends above the thoracic inlet, no less than 7 cm above the carina and it should be advanced at least 3 cm. This could improve aeration of the left lung. NG tube ends in a non-distended stomach. ___ was paged at 11:30 a.m. as soon as the findings were recognized.
