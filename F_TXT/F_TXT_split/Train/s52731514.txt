Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, new perihilar haziness and more confluent opacities at the bases, accompanied by small effusions. Findings are likely due to perihilar and basilar edema, but superimposed process such as aspiration at the lung bases is also possible. Followup radiographs may be helpful.
