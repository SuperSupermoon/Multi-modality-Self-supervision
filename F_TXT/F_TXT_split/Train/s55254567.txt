The heart size is top normal with a left ventricular configuration. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with mild atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta. Streaky linear opacities in the lung bases are most likely reflective of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.
