An AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. The heart size may have increased slightly, but this finding is uncertain as the present portable AP single chest view inherits a degree of geometric distortion. Thoracic aorta is unchanged with ordinary ___ but some calcium deposits in the wall at the level of the arch. There is some degree of perivascular haze in the lung bases and indistinct contours of the pleural sinuses suggestive of some beginning pleural effusion, but there is no evidence of overt central pulmonary parenchymal edema. No new discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are noted and no pneumothorax is present in the apical area. On comparison with the previous examination, the findings are consistent with mild degree or early stages of CHF. A lateral view could be helpful to identify if pleural effusion has accumulated in the posterior pleural sinuses.
