As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no evidence of an ETT. No other device than a right subclavian catheter is seen. There is unchanged evidence of opacities in the right mid lung, likely at the bases of the right upper lobe. The lung volumes remain overall small, no larger pleural effusions. No overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
