The endotracheal tube has been withdrawn in the interval, with the tip currently lying approximately 8 cm above the carina. There appears likely to be a right internal jugular sheath, with unchanged appearance of right pleural pigtail catheter and cardiac monitoring leads. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain unchanged. Radiopacity over the region of the aortic valve consistent with TAVR. Vascular calcifications of the aortic arch are noted. No pneumothorax is evident on this single view. Diffuse pulmonary opacities consistent with pulmonary edema are seen, and if anything appears slightly better than on the prior examination.
