Bilateral lung volumes are low. Single chest tube is present on the left side with its distal end terminating approximately at the level of the left second anterior rib. Bilateral lower lung opacities are present which are likely lower lung atelectasis. Small amount of subcutaneous air in the left lateral chest wall is attributed to the recent VATS. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent and probably exacerbated by the low lung volumes. There is no demonstrable pneumothorax.
