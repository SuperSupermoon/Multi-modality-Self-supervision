AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in comparison with the next preceding chest examination of ___. The present frontal view shows the patient in marked lordotic position related to the patient's posterior tilt. The apical areas are clear and a pneumothorax can be excluded. Heart size is not enlarged. Left-sided basal densities are again noted, consist of linear structures, probably representing atelectasis. The loculated pleural density on the left base and remains rather stable in size. No evidence of new pulmonary abnormalities. The right hemithorax remains unremarkable. There is rather marked gas distended structures of the stomach. No pneumothorax. Apparently stable loculated pleural changes on left base.
