As compared to chest CTA performed 1 day prior, cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Diffuse pulmonary nodules and masses appear unchanged, consistent with widespread metastatic disease. No definite new areas of consolidation, but subtle parenchymal process would be difficult to detect on a portable radiograph given the extent of metastatic disease in the lungs.
