AP chest compared to ___: The left axillary pacer pack has been re-positioned. Transvenous right atrial and left ventricular pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in standard placements. Lung volumes are lower today which may account for apparent increase in moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly that is chronic, as well as basilar predominance of what looked like very mild pulmonary edema on the previous examination. There is no pneumothorax, mediastinal widening or appreciable pleural effusion.
