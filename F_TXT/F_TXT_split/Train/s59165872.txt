1. Endotracheal tube likely has its tip approximately 2 cm above the carina. Placement of nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm and has its tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach. Lung volumes remain low. The heart is upper limits of normal in size given portable technique. There is increasing prominence to the hilar soft tissues, which may reflect prominent vascular structures. This can be better assessed on followup imaging. Low lung volumes with patchy opacity at the left base most likely reflecting atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No large pneumothorax. No large pleural effusions. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
