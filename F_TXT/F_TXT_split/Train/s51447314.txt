Supine portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is slightly low in position, terminating 1.7 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube is seen terminating in the inferior hemithorax to left of midline, with the side port in the mid hemithorax below the level of the carina. Recommend repositioning. There is a new tubular structure projecting over the lower right neck, which if represents an internal jugular catheter, is high in position, terminating at the level of thoracic inlet. There are extensive bilateral interstitial opacities, which may be due to severe edema, aspiration and possibly pulmonary hemorrhage. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
