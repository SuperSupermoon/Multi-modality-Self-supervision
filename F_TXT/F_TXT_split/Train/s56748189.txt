The endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina, above the level of the clavicular heads. Nasogastric gastric tube passes into the stomach and off the inferior margin of the film. There is a left subclavian line extending to the mid SVC. The lung volumes are low. There is decreased lucency of the lungs bilaterally, which likely reflects in large part increased layering effusions, though increased pulmonary edema is also likely present. There is no pneumothorax. There is no focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.
