Endotracheal tube has its tip 5.3 cm above the carina. Right subclavian central line has its tip in the distal SVC, unchanged. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Interval reduction of lung volumes with bilateral airspace process which could reflect pulmonary edema. More focal retrocardiac opacity is also again identified which may reflect lower lobe collapse, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax.
