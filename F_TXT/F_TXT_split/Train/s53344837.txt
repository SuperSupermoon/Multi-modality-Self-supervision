AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Severe cardiomegaly worsened between ___ and ___ and has increased since, accompanied by increased mediastinal and pulmonary and hilar vascular engorgement. Therefore, the heterogeneous opacification at the right lung base should be questioned as asymmetric edema and accompanying small right pleural effusion. If it fails to respond to improved hemodynamically balance, pneumonia would be a second, and hemorrhage a third consideration. No pneumothorax. In the setting of chronic renal failure, pericardial effusion should also be considered as a possible contributor to enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, though it was not present on a CT scan performed, ___ when the patient had a very small right pleural effusion. That study also showed substantial aortic valvular calcification which could be hemodynamically significant as well.
