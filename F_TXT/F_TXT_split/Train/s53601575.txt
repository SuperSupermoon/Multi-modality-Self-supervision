1. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. Tracheostomy tube remains in place. A face mask obscures the lung apices. The heart remains enlarged likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded. There is a mild prominence of the perihilar vasculature with no evidence of overt pulmonary edema. Subtle increasing retrocardiac opacity may reflect an area of atelectasis, although early pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. Followup imaging may be helpful. No pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax.
