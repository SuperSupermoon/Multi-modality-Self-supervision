AP chest compared to ___ through ___. 12: Endotracheal tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube ends in the lower esophagus and would need to be advanced 12 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. Limited views of the upper abdomen show a generally distended colon, redundant in the right upper abdominal quadrant, making it difficult to exclude pneumoperitoneum. An upright view is recommended when feasible. There may be herniation of a loop of bowel in a posterior (Bochdalek) hernia. Lung volumes are appreciably lower today than on ___. New opacification in the infrahilar left lower lobe is either atelectasis or consolidation due to pneumonia. Supine positioning exaggerates moderate cardiomegaly as well as azygos distention. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are small, if any.
