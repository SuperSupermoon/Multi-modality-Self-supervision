AP chest compared to ___: Lower lung volumes are than on ___, producing vascular crowding and make it difficult to exclude new mild pulmonary edema. Mediastinum has been widened in the region of a heavily calcified and distorted aortic knob for at least a year since chest CT showed a contained aortic arch ulcer or pseudoaneurysm on ___, as well as progressive soft tissue infiltration of the upper mediastinum. Interval widening in the right paratracheal region since ___ is presumably due to vascular engorgement, and perhaps edema. The large bore hemodialysis catheter insertion may have produced some bleeding, and radiographic followup is strongly advised. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart is top normal size, unchanged. If patient becomes hemodynamically unstable or the mediastinal widening progresses disproportionate with hypervolemia, CTA of the chest would be indicated. There are no findings of pneumonia. Dr. ___ was paged at 10 a.m. and we discussed the findings by telephone at 10:05am.
