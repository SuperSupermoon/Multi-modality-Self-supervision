The heart is at the upper limits of normal size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable aside from vague fullness of the right superior mediastinum which probably reflects a known right suprahilar nodule. Throughout each lung, multiple nodules of medium size are noted that are consistent with known metastatic disease. Streaky left basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis in the lingula. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
