AP chest compared to ___: Widespread, diffuse, largely interstitial edema is unchanged since ___. The heart is not particularly enlarged nor is pulmonary vasculature engorged. Small right pleural effusion may be present. Note, chest CT on ___ showed relatively dependent distribution of interstitial infiltration in the left lung as well as a greater preponderance of ground-glass opacification in the right upper lobe and dependent consolidation bilaterally. This combination of morphologic entities is difficult to explain. ET tube in standard placement, right PICC line ends in the right atrium, and an upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Pleural effusion is small if any at all and there is no indication of pneumothorax.
