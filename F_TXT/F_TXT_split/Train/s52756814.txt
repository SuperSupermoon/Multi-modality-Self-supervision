An endotracheal tube, enteric tube, left supraclavicular approach central venous catheter, and right subclavian approach central venous catheter are all in appropriate and stable position from the most recent prior study. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size but stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Bilateral pleural effusions are not significantly changed. There is improved aeration of the bilateral lung bases with persistent mild bilateral infrahilar opacification with air bronchograms on the right. No pneumothorax is present.
