Lung volumes are within normal limits. There has been improved aeration of the bilateral lungs with less confluent consolidation in the left upper and right upper lungs. There is persistent consolidation seen in predominate perihilar distribution consistent with pulmonary edema. A Swan-Ganz catheter is in-situ, the tip appears to be within the left pulmonary artery. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. An endotracheal tube has been withdrawn slightly in now terminates 5 cm above the level of the carina. A nasoenteric tube terminates in the stomach. No pneumothorax seen. No pleural effusion.
