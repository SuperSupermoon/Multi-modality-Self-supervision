AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes have improved and pulmonary vasculature has decreased, but the heart is still at least mildly enlarged. Opacification at the left lung base is probably atelectasis. I see no good evidence for pneumonia. Previously severe gaseous and fluid distention of the stomach has improved.
