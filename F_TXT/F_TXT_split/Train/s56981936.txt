The heart size is mildly enlarged, similar in extent to prior exam. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits given the degree of rotation of the patient. The lungs are clear with lobar consolidation, although bibasilar atelectasis is present. No interstitial edema or septal thickening is present. Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggests small bilateral pleural effusions as well. There is no pneumothorax. The bones demonstrate bilateral degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joints. Multiple bilateral old rib fractures are present, more prominent on the right than the left.
