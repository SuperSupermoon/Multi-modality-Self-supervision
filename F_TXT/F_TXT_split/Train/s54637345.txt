There is a tortuous thoracic aorta. There are low lung volumes. Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. Minimal interstitial prominence likely relates to crowding of bronchovascular structures. A rounded, 3 mm calcific density focus projecting over the lateral left hemithorax may represent a calcified granuloma. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion, however note the right lung apex is obscured by the patient's skull.
