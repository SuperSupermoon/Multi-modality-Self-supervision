As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an additional nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not visualized on the image. A second esophageal device was also inserted. The tip of this device projects over the mid to lower esophagus. No evidence of complications. Increase in transparency of the lung parenchyma at the left lung base, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The area of right perihilar and basal atelectasis is unchanged. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
