Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. The left jugular catheter is unchanged with tip ending in mid SVC. The right upper lobe opacity is now larger since yesterday and highly suspicious for pneumonia. The right lower lobe has improved, for reduced vascular congestion. The opacification of the left lung has markedly increased, for increased pleural effusion. Heart size is persistently enlarged, but not fully assessable for left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
