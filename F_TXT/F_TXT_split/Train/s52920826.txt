There is near complete opacification of the right lung field with linear demarcation of the right upper lobe opacification by the minor fissure and some areas of aeration. There is no mediastinal shift. The left lung field is incompletely imaged, but the visualized portion demonstrates adequate aeration. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina. No pneumothorax is detected.
