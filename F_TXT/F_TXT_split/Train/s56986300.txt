In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. With the left chest tube on water seal, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Basilar opacification persists on the left, consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Again there is evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
