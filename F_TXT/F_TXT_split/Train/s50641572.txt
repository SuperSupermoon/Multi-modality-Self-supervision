Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Subtle right base opacity most likely represents combination of atelectasis and vascular structures, although infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Suggest dedicated PA and lateral views when patient able for better evaluation. No pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
