Lung volumes are slightly lower on the current study compared to the previous. With this in mind, cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Patchy right lower lobe opacity is slightly worsened, and could reflect patchy atelectasis, aspiration, or developing pneumonia. Interval improvement in left retrocardiac opacity, but apparent worsening of a loculated left lateral pleural effusion adjacent to numerous left-sided rib fractures. Left scapular fracture is also noted.
