AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Frontal views suggest region of increased opacity in the left lower lung, partially obscuring the descending thoracic aorta. Lateral view would be important to see if this is left lower lobe pneumonia or alternatively atelectasis or left pleural effusion. Lungs are otherwise clear. Heart size normal. No hilar or mediastinal contour abnormality.
