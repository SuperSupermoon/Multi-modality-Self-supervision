Mild atelectasis is evident at the left lung base laterally. Since the right hemidiaphragm is more elevated than the left, consolidation in the infrahilar right lung is also most likely atelectasis. Upper lungs are clear. Low lung volumes exaggerate size of the heart which could be mildly enlarged. No pulmonary edema. Pleural effusions small FNH.
