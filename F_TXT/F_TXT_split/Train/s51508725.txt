Single portable upright chest radiograph was provided. There is a large right pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe, similar in appearance to the recent prior study. There is no definite focal consolidation however infection can't be entirely excluded in the right lower lung fields. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The left lung is clear. The bones are intact.
