As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimally increasing opacity at both lung bases. The origin of these changes is likely atelectatic and might be emphasized by slight patient rotation. However, continuous radiographic followup is required. No evidence of acute changes. No overt pulmonary edema but minimal fluid overload. No evidence of pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
