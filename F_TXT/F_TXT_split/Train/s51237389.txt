Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Left-sided dual-lumen catheter is seen terminating in the proximal to mid SVC. There is blunting of the costophrenic angles. This may be due to trace pleural effusions. Left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis, also pleural effusion, however underlying consolidation is not excluded. There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
