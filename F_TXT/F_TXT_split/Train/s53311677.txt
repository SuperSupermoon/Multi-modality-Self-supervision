AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Heart is mildly enlarged but the lungs are clear and there is no vascular congestion, edema or evidence of pneumonia. Pleural effusion if any is tiny on the left. Elliptical nodular opacity projecting over the lower pole of the right hilus could be a vessel on end or pulmonary calcification. Conventional radiographs recommended for confirmation when feasible.
