AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. General findings on this single view examination are within normal limits. A left-sided PICC line is again identified and seen to terminate overlying the right-sided mediastinal structures at a level identical with the carina. This corresponds to the mid portion of the SVC. In comparison with the previous examination of ___, a similar line was seen to terminate a few centimeters lower. Provided that the lines have not been changed, this would indicate that the line has been withdrawn by approximately 4 cm. No pneumothorax or any other placement-related complication is identified.
