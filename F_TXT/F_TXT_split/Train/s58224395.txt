In comparison with the study of ___, with the chest tubes to waterseal, there is a small right apical pneumothorax. The left apex is difficult to evaluate. There is the vague suggestion of a pleural line, though pulmonary vessels appear to extend beyond it. The degree of opacification at the right base has substantially decreased. However, bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions persist. There is probably some element of increased pulmonary venous pressure.
