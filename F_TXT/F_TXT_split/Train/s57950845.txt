Median sternotomy wires are intact. A right IJ sheath terminates at the origin of the SVC. There has been interval removal of a Swan-Ganz catheter and left chest tube. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Slight interval improvement in low lung volumes bilaterally. There is no pneumothorax. There is minimally improved, mild pulmonary edema. Right upper and left lower lobe opacities are unchanged and may reflect very mild alveolar edema. Probable, small left pleural effusion persists.
