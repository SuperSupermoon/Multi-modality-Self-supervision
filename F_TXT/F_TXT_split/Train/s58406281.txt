A left subclavian central venous catheter appears to be malpositioned with the tip not crossing midline, projecting over the region of the carina, likely arterial in location. There is no pneumothorax.Low lung volumes are present. Heart size is difficult to assess but is likely mildly enlarged. Aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures and prominence of the hila bilaterally. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. Infection cannot be excluded. Right hemidiaphragm appears mildly elevated.
