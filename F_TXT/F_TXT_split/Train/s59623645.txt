The diaphragms are somewhat obscured which may be due to underlying atelectasis although small pleural effusions not excluded. Subtle left basilar opacity which could relate to consolidation from infection or aspiration. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. There is central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for better evaluation when patient able.
