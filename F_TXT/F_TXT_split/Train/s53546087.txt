The carina is not well delineated. The tip probably lies approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube is present and extends beneath the diaphragm off the film. Other NG type tube is seen extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A left subclavian central line tip overlies the distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged allowing for technical differences and lower inspiratory volumes. There is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF, similar to the ___. Again seen are small bilateral effusions, possibly minimally improved.
