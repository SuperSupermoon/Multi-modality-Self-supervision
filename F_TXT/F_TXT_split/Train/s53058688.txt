The lung volumes are low but clear. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. There is no vascular congestion or overt pulmonary edema. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle may reflect pleural thickening. No large pleural effusions are identified. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
