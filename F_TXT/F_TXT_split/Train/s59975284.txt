Interval removal of the endotracheal tube with placement of a tracheostomy which has its tip at the thoracic inlet, approximately 3 cm above the carina. A left internal jugular central line and a right PICC line are in unchanged position. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach. The heart remains enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. Lung volumes are markedly diminished and there are likely layering bilateral effusions and diffuse airspace process which more likely represents moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema, although diffuse pneumonia should also be in the differential. No evidence of pneumothorax.
