Right pneumothorax with associated subcutaneous gas is again seen, though there appears to be interval improvement of the upper lung portion. Right lower lobe opacity persists which is likely a combination of atelectasis and superimposed pneumonia. The small right pleural effusion remains grossly unchanged. The right apical chest tube is unchanged in position. The small left pleural effusion has not changed, otherwise the left lung is clear. A feeding tube is again seen and remains unchanged position. The cardiomediastinal silhouette has a leftward shift secondary to severe thoracolumbar scoliosis and is unchanged.
