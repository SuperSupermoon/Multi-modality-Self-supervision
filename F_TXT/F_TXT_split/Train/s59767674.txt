Unchanged position of the right pectoral Port-A-Cath. The lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. No larger pleural effusions. The pre-existing bilateral parenchymal abnormalities, diffusely distributed in the lung parenchyma, have decreased in extent and severity, but are still clearly visible. Interstitial predominance of the changes makes mild to moderate interstitial lung edema more likely than an infectious origin.
