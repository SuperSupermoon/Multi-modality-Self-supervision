Compared to add chest radiographs since ___ most recently 19:59 and 22:00 on ___. Left lung is still collapsed, accounting for tip still mediastinal shift in left hemidiaphragm elevation, and there has been an increase in substantial left pleural effusion or hemo thorax, despite the 3 left thoracostomy tubes. Occlusion of the left bronchial airway at the level of the upper lobe takeoff is sufficient explanation for left lung collapse. Volume of right pneumothorax has not appreciably changed since it first appeared at 19:59, although it is possibly underestimated because of supine positioning, anywhere from small to moderate in size. Orientation angulation of the right thoracostomy tube are consistent with though not diagnostic of fissural placement which would explain failure to evacuate the right pneumothorax. There is no right pleural effusion or focal abnormality in the overinflated right lung. ET tube is still positioned 10 cm from the carina, 5 cm above standard placement. Endoscope ends in the lower esophagus.
