Lung volumes are low. Heart size remains moderately enlarged. Aortic knob is calcified. Perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness is compatible with mild pulmonary edema. Small left and small to moderate size right bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis is present.
