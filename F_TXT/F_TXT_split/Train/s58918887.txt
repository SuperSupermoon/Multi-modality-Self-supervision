AP chest compared to ___: The left pleural pigtail catheter which enters the left chest medial to the mid clavicular line is unchanged in position, ascending vertically to the thoracic inlet, ending just to the left of midline behind the head of the left clavicle projecting over the aortic knob. Left pneumothorax is very small, seen only at the apex. Moderate-to-severe bibasilar atelectasis persists. There is probably a minimal left pleural effusion, could be a moderate subpulmonic right pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. There is no evidence of mediastinal bleeding.
