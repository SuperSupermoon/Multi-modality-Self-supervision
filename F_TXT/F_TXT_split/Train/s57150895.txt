AP single view of the lower chest was obtained in order to illustrate a Dobbhoff line placement. Such line is identified and seen to reach well into the body of the stomach with its metallic dense tip pointing towards the pylorus. The line is in similar position as the one identified on ___. Clinical information indicates, however, that the line has been exchanged. Previously described right internal jugular double-lumen line remains in unchanged position terminating in the mid portion of the SVC at the level of the carina.
