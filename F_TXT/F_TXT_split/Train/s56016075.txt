ET tube ends at 4 cm from carina in correct position. NG tube ends in mid gastric cavity. Lung volume is reduced with new large opacification of the mid and lower left lung for consolidation and new pleural effusion. Considering the rapid change in less than four hours, this consolidation is probably due to atelectasis. If the patient is symptomatic, pneumonia should be considered along with pulmonary embolism. Right lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size seems normal. Findings have been reported to Dr. ___ at 11:10 a.m. by Dr. ___.
