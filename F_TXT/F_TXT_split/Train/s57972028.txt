AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Opacification in the left hemithorax has improved, but it is difficult to say whether this is due to a decrease in the generalized infiltrative abnormality or decrease of moderate left pleural effusion. Nevertheless, there is still widespread pulmonary abnormality, which could be explained by edema, and suggestion of pneumonia perhaps even with cavitation in the left lung. CT scanning would be definitive in distinguishing among some of these possibilities. An upper enteric tube traverses a mildly to moderately distended neoesophagus. Right pleural tube is still in place and there is probably a small right pleural effusion and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion, but no pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard placement. Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium. Section of tubing in the lower midline is presumably a mediastinal drain.
