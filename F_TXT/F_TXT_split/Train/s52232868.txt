AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier. Currently, the right internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction, in appropriate position. Opacity in the right lower lung appears to be unchanged, most likely reflecting area of scarring and unlikely to represent infectious process. Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base is present. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Lungs are essentially otherwise unchanged.
