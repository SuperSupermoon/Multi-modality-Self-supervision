As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight improvement in extent and severity of the pre-existing, bilateral, very massive parenchymal opacities. The lung apices appeared minimally better ventilated than on the previous image. Moderate cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions persist.
