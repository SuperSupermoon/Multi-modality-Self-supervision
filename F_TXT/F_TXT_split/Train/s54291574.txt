The cardiac silhouette is poorly assessed, but there appears to be interval slight enlargement of the left cardiac silhouette since the most recent prior study. There has also been slight increase in the right pleural effusion with decrease in the right aerated lung. Persistent right medial opacities may represent atelectasis, but pneumonia or tumor progression cannot be excluded. The left lung remains clear. Again seen is a right Port-A-Cath with tip terminating in the low SVC.
