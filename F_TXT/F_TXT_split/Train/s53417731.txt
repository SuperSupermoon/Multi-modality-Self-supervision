As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing left pleural effusion has almost completely resolved. There is a mild retrocardiac atelectasis persisting. The patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube was removed but the right internal jugular vein catheter remains in place. The lung volumes have, as expected, slightly decreased. As a consequence, the platelike atelectasis has newly developed at the right lung base. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No pulmonary edema. No new focal parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax. The alignment of the sternal wires is normal and constant.
