There are bibasilar consolidations which have increased since the prior chest radiograph since ___ and are better characterized on concurrent chest CT. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are difficult to evaluate due to bibasilar opacities and patient rotation. Deformity of the thoracic cage due to old healed rib fractures is noted.
