Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is demonstrated. There is at least a moderate to large hiatal hernia noted. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within a mildly tortuous thoracic aorta. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Any electronic device projects over the left lung base. Remote appearing right-sided rib fractures are noted. Clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen likely indicate prior cholecystectomy.
