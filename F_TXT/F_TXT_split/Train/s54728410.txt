AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. During the interval, the left-sided chest tube has been removed. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There remains a hazy density in the left apical area suggestive of some filling with pleural effusion of the previously existing small post-operative pneumothorax. The left-sided diaphragmatic contour is now visible suggestive that the previously described left lower lobe atelectasis is resolving. Position of previously described left subclavian chest tube remains unaltered.
