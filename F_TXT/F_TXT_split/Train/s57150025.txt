The patient has been intubated in the interim with the ETT tip approximately 4 cm from the carina, in standard position. The right internal jugular venous catheter tip projects over the expected region of the upper SVC. Since the prior exam, bilateral parenchymal airspace opacities have worsened, particularly in the right lung which could be edema and/or infection. Several areas of more nodular parenchymal opacities particularly in the right lung as well as the left lower lung are concerning for concurrent multifocal pneumonia. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is enlarged. The mediastinum is not widened. Median sternotomy wires appear intact. An enteric tube traverses the hemidiaphragm into the left upper quadrant and its tip is not visualized but the side port is within the stomach.
