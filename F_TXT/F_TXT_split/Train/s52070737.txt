1. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflecting atelectasis in the setting of somewhat diminished lung volumes. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Apparent blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be projectional as no pleural effusion was present on the recent chest CT. No pneumothorax. Heart is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
