There has been interval appearance of right mid lung and bibasilar opacities which would be more concerning for pneumonia rather than pulmonary edema. However, clinical correlation is advised. There is possibly a small left effusion. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
