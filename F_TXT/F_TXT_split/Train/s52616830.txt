Right subclavian Swan-Ganz catheter ends in main pulmonary artery, left subclavian arterial line ends in the aortic arch, NG tube ends below the diaphragm in standard position. Right pleural tube is still projected at the right lung base and is following the path of the minor fissure. The left pleural drain is in the left major fissure. Both pleural drains might not be working properly in this position. Clear left base pneumothorax, likely also in the right lung base, but less evident. Pneumomediastinum is still visible and mild. Persist right base opacification with new right upper lobe opacification likely for new consolidation suspicious for pneumonia. The left lung is still clear without pleural effusion. Small pleural effusion at the right lung base. The extensive subcutaneous emphysema is stable. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
