Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Enteric tube is seen terminating in the region of the midline of the chest, most likely within the mid esophagus, does not fully project over the airway; however, airway involvement is not entirely excluded. There is a large area of opacity projecting over the right mid-to-lower lung as well as left retrocardiac lucency consistent with patient's known large hiatal hernia. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified.
