The right-sided chest tube has been removed. There continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema tracking within the right chest wall and neck. Known small right pneumothorax is not well delineated on the current exam. Small amount of pneumomediastinum is similar. Patchy ill-defined opacities within the right lung likely reflect areas of contusion with atelectasis. Patchy opacity in left lung base likely reflects atelectasis. Trace bilateral pleural effusions are re- demonstrated. Multiple bilateral rib fractures are better delineated on the recent CT.
