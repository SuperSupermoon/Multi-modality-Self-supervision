Both lungs are remarkable for persisting mild interstitial pulmonary edema. The retrocardiac density has worsened reflecting an increased atelectasis in the left lower lung. Mild atelectasis in the right lower medial lung has also minimally worsened. Pleural effusion if any is minimal on the right side and stable. Heart size is mildly enlarged and unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable in appearance.
