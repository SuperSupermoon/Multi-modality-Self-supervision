As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. There are unchanged signs of mild to moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions. And moderate cardiomegaly. Atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases. No pneumonia. Clips projecting over the left thoracic inlet are unchanged.
