There is near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax, due to atelectasis/collapse of the left lung. There is leftward deviation of the trachea, as before. The right demonstrates slight interval worsening of linear basal atelectasis. Chronic right humeral head dislocation is again noted, unchanged compared to the prior study.
