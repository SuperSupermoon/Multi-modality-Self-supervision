Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. As compared to prior study the left chest tube has been discontinued. There are areas of bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax demonstrated and there is overall improved aeration of the lung bases. Minimal apical pneumothorax is suspected on the left, further attention with chest radiographs is recommended.
