Heterogeneous consolidative and infiltrative abnormality in the right lung has worsened node dramatically since earlier in the day. The rapid change could be due to edema, cardiogenic or noncardiogenic, or pulmonary hemorrhage, but is unlikely due to worsening infection alone. Left lung remains severely consolidated. Cardiac silhouette is obscured, but mediastinal venous engorgement reflects elevated right heart pressure. Pleural effusions are presumed but not large. No pneumothorax. .
