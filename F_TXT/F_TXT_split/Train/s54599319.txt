Assessment is limited by patient rotation and the patient's head obscuring the right mid and upper lung fields. Patient is status post median sternotomy. Heart size appears at least mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are difficult to assess given the degree of rotation. Lung volumes are low. Patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases, potentially atelectasis. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion, perhaps slightly improved in the interval. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. Remote left-sided rib fractures are present.
