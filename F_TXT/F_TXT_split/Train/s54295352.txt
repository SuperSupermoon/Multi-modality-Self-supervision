In comparison to the prior radiograph performed 3 hours earlier, there has been an interval increase in the diffuse interstitial opacities and redistribution, perhaps slightly worse at the right lung base. Along with underlying moderate cardiomegaly, these findings together suggest pulmonary edema. There is no substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A linear radiopaque line along the periphery of the right hemithorax represents a fold from the patient's gown, as lung markings are seen lateral to this line. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
