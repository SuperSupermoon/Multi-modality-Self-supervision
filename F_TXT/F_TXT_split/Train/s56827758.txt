Single portable AP view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen, inferior aspect not included, however, seen to at least course into the expected location of the stomach. There are relatively low lung volumes. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a trace pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. Minimal bibasilar opacities may relate to mild aspiration. The cardiac silhouette is top normal.
