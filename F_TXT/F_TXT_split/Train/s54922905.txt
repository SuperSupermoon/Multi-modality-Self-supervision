No previous images. There are extremely low lung volumes, which accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Opacification at the left base most likely reflects a combination of volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Given the low lung volumes, there is no definite radiographic evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
