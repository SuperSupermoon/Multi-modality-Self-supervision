Compared to ___, a left-sided pigtail catheter has been placed. There has been essentially complete clearing of the previously seen left effusion. There is minimal underlying patchy opacity, possibly atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. The distribution and density of the opacity in the left upper/mid/lower zone is slightly different, but overall similar. Again seen is background hyperinflation/COPD, with extensive parenchymal scarring and extensive biapical pleural calcifications. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured, but grossly unchanged. No definite superimposed CHF is identified. The right costophrenic sulcus is grossly clear, without evidence of right pleural effusion. Again noted is severe sigmoid scoliosis and clips over the left neck.
