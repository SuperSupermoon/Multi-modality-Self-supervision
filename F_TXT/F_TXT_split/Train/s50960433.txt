There are low lung volumes. No focal consolidation is appreciated on this limited view. A small left pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. Compared to prior exam, there is decreased prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. There has been interval removal of a left-sided PICC. Exam is otherwise unchanged. Slightly prominent loops of air-filled colon are again noted under the right hemidiaphragm.
