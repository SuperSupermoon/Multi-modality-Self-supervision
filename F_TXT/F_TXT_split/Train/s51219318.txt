As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in correct position, except for the endotracheal tube that has been pulled back. The tube now projects approximately 5 cm above the carina with its tip. The patient is rotated. A pre-existing right parenchymal basal opacity therefore appears slightly more extensive than on the previous image. Blunting of the right costophrenic sinus might be artificial. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis.
