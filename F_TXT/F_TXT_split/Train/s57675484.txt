There has been no appreciable change since earlier in the day following substantial improvement in widespread pulmonary consolidation compared to ___. Residual opacification is present throughout the lungs, much improved in all locations, except the lingula. This raises the possibility of improving edema, largely cardiogenic given the previous distension of mediastinal and pulmonary vessels, and concurrent pneumonia. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. Heart is normal size and mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature no longer engorged. ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements. Left PIC line ends just outside the chest. Nasogastric tube passes into the upper portion of a nondistended stomach and out of view.
