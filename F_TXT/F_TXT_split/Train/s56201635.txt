Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but has slightly decreased in size, and diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities have slightly improved, possibly representing pulmonary edema. However, there remains a more consolidative process in the right upper lobe that could reflect a coexisting pneumonia. Bilateral pleural effusions appear similar to the prior radiograph, and a left pleural catheter remains in place. There is no pneumothorax. Left PICC terminates in the left axilla, similar to recent radiographs.
