Body habitus somewhat limits evaluation. A right PICC line terminates in the upper SVC. Lung volumes are low. There is increased caliber of the pulmonary vessels without frank pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces appear normal. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
