In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the large right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis at the base. Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged with some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Dialysis catheter tip is in the lower SVC. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia at the right base, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
