Left internal jugular vascular catheter tip terminates in the midline position in the left brachiocephalic vein, tip of endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina, and right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid superior vena cava. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Rapidly improving asymmetrically distributed alveolar opacities involving the left lung to a greater degree than the right most likely represent pulmonary edema given the rapid change. Moderate left and small-to-moderate right layering pleural effusions are present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
