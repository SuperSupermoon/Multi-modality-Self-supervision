Since the prior study, there has been no significant change in perihilar opacities, likely representing mild pulmonary edema. The lung volumes are low, and there is no appreciable pleural effusion bilaterally. A small amount of atelectasis is present at the lung bases. The cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable. Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. No pneumothorax is present.
