Overall, there continues to be a diffuse bilateral interstitial abnormality but when compared to a prior study dating ___ at 8:02, the degree of interstitial abnormality has substantially subsided, and therefore these findings are suggestive of resolving pulmonary and interstitial edema. There is a persistent deformity of the right lower ribcage consistent with previous fractures. No large effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax.
