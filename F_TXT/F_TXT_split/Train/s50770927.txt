1. Right subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC. An endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina, unchanged. 2. Lung volumes remain low with patchy bilateral opacities, left greater than right, with probable small layering effusions. These findings most likely represent compressive atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large pneumothoraces, although the sensitivity to detect the pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning.
