Interval worsening of patchy right lower lobe opacity, probably reflecting patchy atelectasis, but co-existing pneumonia is possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Small right pleural effusion is apparently new or increased. Within the left lung, a linear focus of atelectasis has developed in the left lower lobe. Otherwise, no relevant change since recent radiograph.
