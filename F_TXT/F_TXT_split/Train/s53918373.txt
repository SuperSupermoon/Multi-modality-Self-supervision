A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right PICC terminating at the cavoatrial junction. There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which courses below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Lung volumes are slightly lower compared to prior, with exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Allowing for this, there is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
