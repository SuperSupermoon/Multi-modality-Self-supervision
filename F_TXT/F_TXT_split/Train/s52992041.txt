Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina, and left PICC terminates in the distal left brachiocephalic vein near the junction with the superior vena cava. Cardiac silhouette is stable in size. Increased mediastinal vascular width accompanied by worsening pulmonary vascular congestion. Multifocal areas of consolidation and poorly defined nodular opacities consistent with multifocal infection appear similar compared to the prior study as well as moderate right and small left pleural effusions.
