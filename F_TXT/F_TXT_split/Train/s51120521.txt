Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained. Dense retrocardiac opacity in a post-ictal setting are concerning for possible aspiration, though it could also be due to pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion is likely also present. Cardiac size and cardiomediastinal silhouette are likely normal. Displaced transverse left humeral diaphysis fracture is incompletely imaged.
