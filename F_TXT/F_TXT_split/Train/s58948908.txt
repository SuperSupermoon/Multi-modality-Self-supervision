Portable semi-upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a small apical pneumothorax. A right chest tube is unchanged in position. A superior vena cava stent remains in place. A left IJ catheter tip is positioned at the cavoatrial junction, a right subclavian central venous catheter tip is positioned in the lower SVC, just beyond the SVC stent. Lung volumes are low, bibasilar atelectasis is resolving. The pulmonary vasculature is normal, and there is interval improvement in azygous distention. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
