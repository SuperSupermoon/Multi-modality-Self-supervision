Interval removal of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance, with persistent cardiomegaly. Rounded lucency in left retrocardiac region may correspond to a hiatal hernia. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present, but interstitial edema has resolved. Moderate right pleural effusion and adjacent right lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation appears similar to the prior study, and a small left pleural effusion and left retrocardiac atelectasis appears essentially unchanged.
