AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging: Some of the mediastinal widening could be due to vascular congestion in the supine position, and there is no displacement of the trachea or the esophagus, as denoted by the drainage tube, to indicate a large hematoma, but the thoracic aorta is very poorly defined and could be considerably enlarged. Possibility of a dissection should be entertained clinically. The heart is mildly enlarged, pulmonary vascular engorgement is severe, but there is no pulmonary edema. Pleural effusions are small, if any. No pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard placement and an upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged. Although there are no displaced acute rib fractures visible, conventional radiographs are unlikely to reveal most chest cage trauma and therefore if there are focal findings or strong reason to suspect such trauma, then chest CT scanning should be performed. Dr. ___ was paged to discuss these findings at 1:40 p.m. I discussed the findings by telephone with Dr ___ at 2pm.
