AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained five hours earlier during the same day. A right-sided pigtail and drainage tube has been placed through the right lower lateral chest wall and terminates in right-sided supradiaphragmatic position. Observe that the line appears kinked a few centimeters proximal to the pigtail end. This finding could indicate obstruction of the line. Comparison with the next previous study, the absence of any drainage line, the at that time existing massive right-sided pleural effusion has cleared up almost completely. Evidence of left-sided pleural effusion has increased in comparison with the next previous study. Quantitation of fluid, however, appears uncertain as more or less increased patient's tilt vary position of fluid. The patient remains intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea 3 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax is seen. The position of the left-sided internal jugular approach central venous line is unchanged and terminates in the mid portion of the SVC at the level of the carina.
