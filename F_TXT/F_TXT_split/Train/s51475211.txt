The endotracheal tube ends 2.6 above the level of the carina, not significantly changed. There is partial visualization of a left-sided pacemaker with associated right atrial and right ventricular leads. An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm and out of field of view inferiorly. A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the low SVC. Lung volumes remain low. Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema has slightly improved. Massive cardiomegaly is not significantly changed. Note is made of a calcified left ventricular aneurysm, as before. The mediastinal contours are not significantly changed. Small bilateral pleural effusions are thought likely. Dense retrocardiac opacification is likely atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
