The Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the pulmonary outflow tract. The left-sided central line terminates in the mid to lower SVC. The endotracheal tube is 5 cm above the carina. The enteric tube extends beyond the GE junction with tip out of view. Lung volumes are low. The heart is moderately enlarged. There has been interval aeration of the left upper lung. There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity which may represent a small left pleural effusion and atelectasis. Airspace opacities in the right lung appear unchanged compared to prior study likely representing pulmonary edema, however a superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
