1. The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip in the right main stem bronchus. A wet reading was again provided to ___ by Dr. ___ ___ on ___ at 20:59. Repositioning was advised. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Nasogastric tube has now been retracted and the side port is in the distal esophagus. Advancement is also advised of this tube. 2. Low lung volumes with persistent linear opacity in the right mid lung consistent with subsegmental atelectasis and retrocardiac consolidation with air bronchograms likely representing lower lobe atelectasis given the position of the endotracheal tube being in the right main stem bronchus. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
