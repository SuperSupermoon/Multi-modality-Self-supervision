Moderate left pleural effusion may have decreased slightly since ___, with a small bore pleural drainage catheter in place. Large right pleural effusion however is increasing. Bibasilar atelectasis is moderate on the right, severe on the left. Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured, but not grossly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. A right supraclavicular jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. Left lung nodules are difficult to see because of overlying pleural effusion and atelectasis.
