Comparison is made with prior study ___. ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged. Bibasilar opacities larger on the left side, partially imaged, have worsened from prior study. There has been worsening of bibasilar atelectasis and probably small bilateral pleural effusions larger on the left side. Cardiomegaly is also partially imaged. Of note, the lower hemithoraces were not included on the film.
