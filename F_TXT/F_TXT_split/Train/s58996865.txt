There are low inspiratory volumes, with rotated positioning. No central line is detected on the current study. No obvious pneumothorax is detected. There are low inspiratory volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly prominent. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, similar prior. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and a probable small left effusion. Pleural fluid is seen tracking along the right chest wall into the right lung apex. There is upper zone redistribution. Allowing for low inspiratory volumes, no definite CHF, though thickening of the minor fissure is noted.
