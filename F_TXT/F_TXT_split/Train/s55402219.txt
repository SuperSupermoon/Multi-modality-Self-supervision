Poor lung volumes account for vascular crowding. There are no focal opacities in the left lung. A rounded consolidation abutting the right hemidiaphragm is noted in the right lower lung region which is unchanged compared with prior CT and corresponds to known lung mass. There is no evidence of abdominal free air or pleural effusion. A subsequent chest CT demonstrated the presence of pneumothorax, which is poorly seen on this study.
