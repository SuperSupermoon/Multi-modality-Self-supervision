In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends at least to the upper to midportion of the stomach. However, the side port is close to the esophagogastric junction and the tube should be pushed forward at least 5 cm for more optimal position. There are lower lung volumes that accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette tortuosity of the aorta. The indistinct pulmonary vessels are consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion. No definite acute focal pneumonia or pleural effusion.
