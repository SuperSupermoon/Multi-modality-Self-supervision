AP chest compared to remote chest radiographs from ___: There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. Aside from mild subsegmental atelectasis at the left base, lungs are clear. Mediastinum is widened to the right above the level of the right main bronchus to the clavicle. There is no tracheal displacement away from this area, so I doubt this is a hematoma. It could be fat deposition, or perhaps adenopathy. I would strongly recommend conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs as soon as feasible to compare with the mediastinum in ___, which was widened and quite similar, a strong indication that the finding is due to fat deposition and nothing more significant.
