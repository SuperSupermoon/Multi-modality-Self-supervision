There are low lung volumes and the patient appears somewhat kyphotic in position. Low lung volumes cause vascular crowding although there may be a mild component of vascular congestion. Perihilar opacities most likely relate to vascular congestion although underlying infectious process or aspiration at the left lung base or right perihilar region is not entirely excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in technique and patient position.
