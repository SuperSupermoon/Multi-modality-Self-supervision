Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with some bronchovascular crowding. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with adjacent atelectasis. The right upper lobe opacity is somewhat less conspicuous on this exam. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
