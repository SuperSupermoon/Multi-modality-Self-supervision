As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes are unchanged. Pre-existing predominantly interstitial signs of fluid retention have almost completely cleared. However, moderate cardiomegaly with signs of minimal fluid overload persists. The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
