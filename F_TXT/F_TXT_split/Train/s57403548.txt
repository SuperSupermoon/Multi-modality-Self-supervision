There has been interval endotracheal intubation. The endotracheal tube terminates about 4.5 cm above the carina. A pacemaker lead again terminates in the right ventricle. The heart is again enlarged. Calcification is noted along the left apical cardiac margins, as before. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. The lungs appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
