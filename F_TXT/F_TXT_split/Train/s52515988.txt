AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding supine chest examination obtained five hours earlier. The patient is now status post sternotomy with typical circular metallic wires in midline. The patient remains extubated similar as on the preceding study. The right internal jugular sheath in unchanged position, but again noted kinking in the outside portion of the sheath. Right-sided mediastinal drainage tube advanced from below remains in place, terminating in paramediastinal position at the level just 1 cm below the clavicle. The position is unchanged in comparison with the previous study, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax or any new pleural effusions that can be identified in this portable single view chest examination. An additional right-sided chest tube advanced from the lower lateral chest wall is seen to terminate overlying the right-sided cardiomediastinal junction. The right lateral pleural sinus is free from any fluid accumulation. Heart shadow moderately enlarged as before, but no significant interval change. There exists a small drainage tube seen to terminate in the central portion of the heart shadow and possibly representing a pericardial drainage. This line existed already on the previous examination five hours ago.
