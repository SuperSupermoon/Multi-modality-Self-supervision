As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema are constant. Due to patient rotation, a faint opacity in the right upper lobe is better seen than on the previous radiograph. Bilateral symmetrical apical scarring is present. The pre-existing opacity at the left lung base is minimally decreased as compared to previous image. Moderate cardiomegaly. Unchanged tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
