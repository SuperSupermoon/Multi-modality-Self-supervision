The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. An NG tube passes out of view below the diaphragm. An ET tube is 6 cm above the carina and could be advanced 2-3cm for more secure seating.
