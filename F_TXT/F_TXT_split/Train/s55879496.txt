Circumferential left pleural thickening and effusion is again demonstrated in the left hemithorax, consistent with known pleural metastatic disease. Adjacent lung opacities in the mid and lower lung have worsened in the left mid lung region, with now complete obscuration of the left heart border. It is uncertain whether this represents atelectasis associated with the pleural disease or a focus of developing infectious consolidation. Right lung is clear.
