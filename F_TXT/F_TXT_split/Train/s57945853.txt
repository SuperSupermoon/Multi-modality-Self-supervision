There is a right chest Port-A-Cath with distal tip projecting over the low SVC. Low lung volumes likely accentuates the size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
