There is trauma board artifact overlying both lungs. Mild prominence of the cardiac silhouette is likely accentuated by supine positioning and AP technique. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise within normal limits. Minimal density at both lung apices is noted, but the appearance is not typical for apical capping. Lungs are relatively well expanded. No CHF, focal infiltrate or consolidation, or pleural effusion is identified. No supine film evidence of pneumothorax is detected. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is grossly unremarkable. Visualized osseous structures are notable for mild degenerative changes within the thoracolumbar spine, with osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis. There is a possible nondisplaced posterior ___ left rib fracture.
