Interval placement of a dual lumen right internal jugular central line with its tip in the distal SVC. Right subclavian PICC line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged position. Fluctuating but likely not significantly changed bilateral parenchymal airspace process most consistent with pulmonary edema, less likely infection. Clinical correlation is recommended. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits given portable technique. No obvious pneumothorax. Probable small layering effusions. Multiple surgical clips in the epigastric region. TIPS stent is in place.
