The ET tube is 2.5 cm above the carinal. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated. There is dense retrocardiac opacity compatible with volume loss/ infiltrate. There is also a the left effusion. There is a very straight line associated with the effusion, such that hydropneumothorax is of concern. There is a paucity of lung markings in the right upper hemi thorax in although I doubt pneumothorax present it be helpful to obtain a followup.
