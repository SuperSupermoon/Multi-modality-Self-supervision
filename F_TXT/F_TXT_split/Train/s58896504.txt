In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there are low lung volumes with areas of opacification at the bases consistent with layering effusions and atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size or mildly enlarged and there probably is some mild elevation of pulmonary vascular pressure. Small left pneumothorax is again suggested. The subcutaneous emphysema along the lateral chest wall has cleared. Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
