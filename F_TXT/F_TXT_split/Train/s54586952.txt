Single AP Portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval resolution of previously seen pleural effusions, given that a lateral view was not obtained. Subtle patchy left base opacity most likely relates to atelectasis or vascular structures, although an early/mild consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting is difficult to exclude. The right lung is clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
