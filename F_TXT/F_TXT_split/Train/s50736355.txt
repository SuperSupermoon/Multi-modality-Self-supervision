A single frontal portable view of the chest was performed. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. There are prominent, predominantly basilar, interstitial markings which reflects pulmonary edema from biventricular failure. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Calcifications are seen within the aortic arch. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
