There are perihilar airspace opacities bilaterally, with more confluent consolidation in the right mid lung. Peribronchial cuffing is noted bilaterally, along with cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature. The heart is mildly enlarged, similar compared to prior studies. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is likely a pleural effusion on the right.
