AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study dated ___. Already on the preceding study, marked increase of the heart size was noted in comparison with previous chest examinations, which date, almost one year ago. A chest CT of ___, also described evidence of right and left upper lobe pulmonary malignancies that have been treated with CyberKnife radiation. Linear mostly atelectatic densities in this areas appear to be remnants of these interventions and explain the presence of fiducious mark in the territory of the left upper lobe lingula. The accessible pulmonary vasculature is not congested; however, the heart is markedly enlarged. There is now a plate atelectasis in the left lower lobe in retrocardiac position, which explains the poor visibility of the diaphragmatic contour, but there is no evidence of pleural effusion in the lateral pleural sinuses. The thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated and shows extensive wall calcifications at the level of the arch. There is, however, no local contour abnormality suspicious for aneurysm.
