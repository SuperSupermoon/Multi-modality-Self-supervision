Evaluation of location of the endotracheal tube is difficult to assess due to the overlying catheters. There is a new catheter projecting over the neck, likely external to the patient, which limits evaluation. However the tip of the endotracheal tube appears to be 4 cm above the carina. If there is high concern, repeat imaging could be obtained with displacement of externa catheters around the expected location the endotracheal tube. The pacemaker, right IJ central line, and feeding tube appear unchanged position. Heart size is upper limits of normal. There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity and left-sided pleural effusion. There are no pneumothoraces.
