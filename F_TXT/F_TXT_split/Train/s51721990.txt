An endotracheal tube terminates 3.6 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube extends at least to the stomach. A right IJ catheter terminates at the mid SVC. A left cardiac pacemaker projects a lead into the right atrium, however the defibrillation and ventricular pacer wires deviate at the level of the tricuspid valve, the latter possibly taking a left ventricular course. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Numerous predominantly right-sided nodular opacities are minimally changed since the prior two chest radiographs performed on the same day.
