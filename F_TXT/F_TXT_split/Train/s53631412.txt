One portable supine frontal view of the chest. The patient is rotated, shifting the projection of the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar silhouette shifted to the patient's left. The right lung is clear. There is a retrocardiac opacity in the mid and lower left lung that likely represents a combination of consolidation and volume loss. No evidence of pneumothorax. A small pleural effusion on the left cannot be ruled out. An ET tube ends 6 cm from the carina. Enteric tube ends in the stomach.
