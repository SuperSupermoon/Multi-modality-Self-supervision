There is continued evidence of bilateral pleural effusions and underlying compressive atelectasis. Interstitial markings are prominent, possibly due to pulmonary vascular congestion. Mediastinal structures are stable. A left PICC now terminates in the region of the lower superior vena cava. An endotracheal tube ends at the thoracic inlet. A feeding tube no longer traverses the mediastinum. The tube with the side hole is projected over in the left where it appears to be coiled. No free air is identified.
