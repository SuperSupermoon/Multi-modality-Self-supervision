The patient has been extubated. The chest tube appears unchanged in comparison to the prior chest radiograph. There is a persistent large right pneumothorax, now with complete collapse of the remaining right lung, patient status post right upper lobe resection, likely due to mucous plugging as the right main stem bronchus is not visualized. There is shift of the mediastinal structures and heart towards the right. A small amount of subcutaneous air has developed in the interim. The left lung appears clear. No pleural effusion is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
