In comparison with the study of ___, continued obliquity of the patient makes it somewhat difficult to evaluate the heart and lungs. Dense atelectatic streak has developed in the left base with area of opacification in the retrocardiac region. Although this could represent merely atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. The questioned area of increased opacification at the right base does not appear to be present. Again, the pleuroparenchymal opacities seen on CT in the left apical region are difficult to assess on plain radiographs. The nasogastric tube has been pushed forward, so that the tip points downward at the level of the mid stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the image.
