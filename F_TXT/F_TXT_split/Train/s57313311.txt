There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. There continues to be pulmonary vascular re-distribution with perihilar haze compatible with fluid overload. There are patchy areas of alveolar infiltrates bilaterally most likely due to pulmonary edema but underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded. Left-sided PICC line is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
