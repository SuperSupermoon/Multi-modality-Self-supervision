There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube with tip projecting over the medial aspect of the left lung base. There is continual residual atelectasis in the left lung base with probable small hemothorax, though extent of residual pneumothorax is difficult to assess on this supine study. Extensive subcutaneous gas in the left chest wall persists with subcutaneous emphysema also noted coursing cephalad along the fascial planes of the neck bilaterally. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are similar with no rightward shift of mediastinal structures. Minimal atelectasis is noted in the right lung base. Known multiple left-sided rib fractures are better assessed on the previous CT. Left-sided pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle is again noted.
