An endotracheal tube ends approximately 3.0 cm above the carina. A nasoenteric tube ends in the stomach. Lung volumes are low, with improvement of a left perihilar and infrahilar opacity. A left basilar opacity persists. Cardiomegaly is increased likely secondary to low lung volumes. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
