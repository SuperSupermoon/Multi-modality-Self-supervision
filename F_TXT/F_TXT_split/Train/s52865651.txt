The patient is rotated to the right, which results in limited evaluation of the mediastinal structures, though the mild cardiomegaly is likely. There is blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles, which may be secondary to small effusions. Bilateral atelectasis is also likely. No overt interstitial pulmonary edema is identified. There is no pneumothorax.
