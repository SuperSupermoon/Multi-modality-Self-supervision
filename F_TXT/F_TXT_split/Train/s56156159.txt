Frontal view of the chest was obtained. There is near-complete opacification of left hemithorax with slight rightward shift of the mediastinal structures. This is most compatible with a large amount of left pleural fluid. The right lung is clear. Right heart border is unremarkable. Osseous structures are unremarkable. No radiopaque foreign bodies.
