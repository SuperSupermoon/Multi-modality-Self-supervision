As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved transparency of the left and right lung base, reflecting improved ventilation and decreased size of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities. No new parenchymal opacities. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinuses suggests the presence of remnant and small pleural effusions. The monitoring and support devices as well as the pacemaker are constant in course and position.
