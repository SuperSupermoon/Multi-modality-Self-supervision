The lungs are hyperexpanded consistent with COPD. The diaphragms appear more flat and compared to the prior radiograph, which may be due to a better inspiration or small bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is no pneumothorax.
