There has been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter which ends in the proximal right atrium, it would need to be withdrawn ___-15mm to end in the low SVC. A lucency at the right lung apex, likely represents a skin fold with a tiny apical pneumothorax also possible, attention on followup imaging. An endotracheal tube has been retracted and is in appropriate position. Lung volumes are improved. There remain bibasilar opacities. There is no large pleural effusion.
