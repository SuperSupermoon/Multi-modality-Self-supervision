Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. Previous large right upper loculated pleural effusion is much smaller, but still substantial. Right mid and upper lung is poorly aerated, perhaps atelectasis or re-expansion edema, but an area that should be followed for the possibility of new pneumonia. The same is true for the left lower lobe. Areas also pulmonary vascular congestion indicating a component of cardiac decompensation. Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac portion of the postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Left pleural effusion is presumed but not large. There is no pneumothorax. Indwelling cardiopulmonary support devices are unchanged in standard placements.
