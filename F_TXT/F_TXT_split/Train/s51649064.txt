A single AP radiograph was reviewed. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes causing bronchovascular crowding. A right basilar opacity partly silhouetting the right hemidiaphragm is noted. Left basilar atelectasis is also present. A high riding right humeral head with a top normal acromio-clavicular interval is noted, which may reflect a prior injury.
