Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Allowing for differences in technique and inspiration, mild cardiomegaly is grossly stable. Moderate central vascular congestion and interstitial pulmonary edema is noted. Left retrocardiac atelectasis is noted, and there is a probable left pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged from the prior examination.
