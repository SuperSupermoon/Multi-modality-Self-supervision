Lung volumes are low. Endotracheal tube tip terminates at the thoracic inlet, approximately 6.6 cm from the carina. Heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, and possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky and patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is demonstrated. No acute osseous abnormalities are present. There is gaseous distention of the stomach.
