AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained two hours earlier. Previously described right-sided PICC line is in unchanged position. No significant cardiac enlargement as can be excluded on portable examination. Extensive parenchymal infiltrates in entire right lung, as before. No significant interval change can be identified since the preceding examination. Absence of significant cardiac enlargement and typical pulmonary congestive pattern in the left hemithorax is one of the reasons why the rather rapid appearance of massive infiltrates in the right hemithorax is suggestive for aspiration pneumonia. No pneumothorax is seen. Impression:Most likely massive aspiration, no evidence of pulmonary edema.
