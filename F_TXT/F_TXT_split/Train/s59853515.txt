Since the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, there has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube that terminates 3.5 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses the body of the stomach. A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the main pulmonary trunk. Median sternotomy wires are intact. There is no new consolidation. Left retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis. Layering bilateral pleural effusions are similar to the prior study, accounting for is slight differences in technique. There is no pneumothorax. Stable cardiomegaly.
