An endotracheal tube has been placed with the tip terminating approximately 4 cm above the carina at the level of the thoracic inlet. An OG tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip terminating in the left upper quadrant, likely within the stomach. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Multiple opacities predominantly in the left mid lung zone may represent multifocal infection or malignancy. There is also retrocardiac opacification and subtle increased density in the right lung base. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
