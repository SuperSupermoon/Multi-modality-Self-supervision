Compared to the it chest x-ray from 2 weeks ago there is increased opacity at the left lung base laterally. However this corresponds to region of the nodule seen on the recent chest CT. This is better visualized on today's chest x-ray compared to the chest x-ray from 2 weeks ago likely due to increased in size over time. The other lung nodules are better defined on the recent CT . No focal infiltrate is seen. The right central line is unchanged.
