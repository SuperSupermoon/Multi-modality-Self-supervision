In comparison to the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, there has been further opacification of the right hemi thorax, which is now nearly completely opacified except for a small portion at the right base. This appears to predominantly be due to an enlarging right pleural effusion combined with a large mediastinal mass, which is been more fully evaluated by a recent CT. Tracheostomy tube in bilateral bronchial stents remain in place. Exam is otherwise remarkable for worsening left lower lobe opacity with adjacent small pleural effusion. Known left lung nodules have been more fully evaluated by CT.
