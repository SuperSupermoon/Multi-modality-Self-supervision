As compared to the previous radiograph, the effusion on the left has minimally improved. The areas of bilateral basal atelectasis, left more than right, however, are unchanged in extent and severity. Also unchanged is the moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette, that currently has a shape, potentially suggesting pericardial effusion. Suspicion could be confirmed or ruled out by echocardiography. No new parenchymal opacities. No overt pulmonary edema.
