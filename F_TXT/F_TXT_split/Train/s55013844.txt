Right central venous line ends at the mid-to-lower SVC, and the left hemodialysis catheter ends at the mid-to-upper SVC. The endotracheal tube ends in the trachea approximately 6 cm above the carina. Bilateral pulmonary opacification, consistent with pulmonary edema, is mildly improved. Nasogastric tube is in the stomach and ends outside the view of the radiograph. Cardiomegaly continues to be seen.
