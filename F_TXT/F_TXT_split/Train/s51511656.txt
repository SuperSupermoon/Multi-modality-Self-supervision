Large fluid collection in the left pneumonectomy space is probably larger, since the mediastinum has migrated slightly to the left and air previously in the left pneumonectomy space has extruded into the left chest wall and neck. Vascular congestion has developed in the right lung and there may be mild edema in the lower lobe. Left apical thoracostomy tube unchanged in position. ET tube in standard placement. No nasogastric drainage tube seen. Right supraclavicular central venous catheter ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
