The radiograph obtained at 00:52 hours shows new small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. Lung volumes remain low. However, there is evidence of new mild pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The known right ___ thoracic rib fracture is not seen on this exam. The followup radiograph of 05:29 hours shows increased elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, likely due to a combination of worsening atelectasis and pleural effusion. An endotracheal tube has also been placed, terminating at the level of the clavicles. There is increased opacification along the right paratracheal location, which could be due to a developing hematoma. The left lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax.
