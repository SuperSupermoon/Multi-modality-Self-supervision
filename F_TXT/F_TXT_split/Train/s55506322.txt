Endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the carina. The left subclavian PICC line terminates in the proximal to mid SVC. Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC near the junction with the brachiocephalic vein. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There is increasing bibasilar consolidation and layering effusions, right greater than left. Findings are suggestive of atelectasis. A superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. No pulmonary edema. No obvious pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.
