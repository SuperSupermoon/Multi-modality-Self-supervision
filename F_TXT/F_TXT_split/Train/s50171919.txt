CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. There are low inspiratory volumes. A right IJ line is present, tip at SVC/RA junction, unchanged compared with ___. There is upper zone re-distribution likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes, but no overt CHF. There is patchy opacity at both lung bases, likely atelectasis given low lung volumes, and grossly unchanged.
