Comparison is made to prior study from ___ at 2:59 a.m. ETT, left-sided subclavian catheter and nasogastric tube are appropriately sited and unchanged in position. There is a new right-sided central line with distal lead tip in the mid-to-distal SVC. Heart size is upper limits of normal. There are calcifications of the mitral annulus. There is some atelectasis at both lung bases and a left retrocardiac opacity that is stable. There are likely bilateral pleural effusion, unchanged. No pneumothoraces are seen.
