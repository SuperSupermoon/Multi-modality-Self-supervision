The patient is rotated. The opacity in the right lung appears more widespread now with greater involvement of the perihilar region silhouetting of the right heart border and right hemidiaphragm. Apparent increased rightward shift of the mediastinum may in part be secondary to volume loss as well as patient position. Right pleural effusion is moderate, probably slightly increased. Left lower lung atelectasis is probably unchanged - the left costophrenic angle is cut off from the image. Left lung edema as increased and new from the prior exam. Left lower lung consolidation may also reflect focus of pneumonia. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. No pneumothorax. The ETT is positioned is overall unchanged, approximately 7 cm from the carina. Right internal jugular venous catheter ends in the mid SVC, unchanged. Enteric tube traverses the diaphragm and its tip unseen.
