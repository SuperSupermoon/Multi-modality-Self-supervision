An indwelling catheter is present, with tip over proximal/mid SVC. There are low inspiratory volumes. There are diffuse increased interstitial markings in both lungs. There are some more patchy confluent areas at the right and left bases medially. Probable air bronchograms at the left base. There is possible trace pleural fluid at the right costophrenic angle and a small left costophrenic effusion. The cardiac silhouette is obscured by the surrounding opacities, but is likely not enlarged. Possible prominence of the left hilum.
