Following left thoracentesis and placement of a left pleural catheter, a left pleural effusion has markedly decreased in size with only a small remaining effusion. There is no definite pneumothorax. The left lung was previously completely collapsed and has mostly reexpanded with residual atelectasis remaining in the left mid and lower lung. Additional opacities in the left parahilar region accompanied by peripheral septal lines may reflect a component of reexpansion pulmonary edema given recent large volume thoracentesis.
