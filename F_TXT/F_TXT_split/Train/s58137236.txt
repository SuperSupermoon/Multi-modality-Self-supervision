In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs suggesting underlying chronic pulmonary disease. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Bibasilar atelectatic changes, but no definite acute pneumonia. Apical pleural changes are seen bilaterally, consistent with old healed tuberculous disease.
