Right internal jugular introduing catheter remains in place. Overall stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours in this patient status post median sternotomy for CABG. There is slightly improved aeration in the retrocardiac region but there is residual opacity with associated layering fluid suggestive of partial lower lobe atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. A smaller right effusion is likely present. The left-sided chest tube has been removed and there has been interval appearance of a small left apical pneumothorax.
