Single portable view of the chest. No prior. The lungs are hyperinflated. There is apparent increased opacity in the retrocardiac region. This is likely partially attributed to mitral annular calcifications; however, underlying consolidation is also possible. Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Hypertrophic change is seen in the spine.
