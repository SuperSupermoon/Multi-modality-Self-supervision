As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular vein catheter has been removed. The feeding tube is in unchanged position. Also unchanged is a drain projecting over the region of the liver. There is unchanged evidence of a relatively extensive right and a moderate left pleural effusion, both with subsequent areas of atelectasis at the lung bases. No pulmonary edema is currently seen. Moderate cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pneumothorax.
