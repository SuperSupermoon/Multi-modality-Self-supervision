Endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina. A right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC. Left pacemaker remains in unchanged position with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle and left ventricle. Enteric tube terminates in the gastric fundus. Stable mild cardiomegaly. Moderate pulmonary edema has significantly improved. Left lower lung is not well aerated which may represent atelectasis versus residual edema and probably overlying pleural fluid. No large pneumothorax.
