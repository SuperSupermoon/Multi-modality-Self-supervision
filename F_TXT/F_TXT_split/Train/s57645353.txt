As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a superior vena cava stent. The pre-existing parenchymal opacity surrounding the left hilus has largely resolved, a paramediastinal opacity, likely post-procedural, has newly occurred. The opacities at the lung bases are less severe than on the previous image, but left lower lobe atelectasis is present. The pleural drain on the left is in unchanged position. In the interval, the patient has been intubated and the tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3 cm above the carina. No evidence of pneumothorax.
