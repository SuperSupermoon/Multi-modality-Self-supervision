Large right pleural effusion has increased since earlier in the day accompanied by sufficient worsening atelectasis to prevent mediastinal shift. Vascular congestion and mild edema in the left lung are unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but hard to assess because the right heart border is obscured. Right supraclavicular dual channel large bore catheter ends in the upper right atrium as before. No pneumothorax.
