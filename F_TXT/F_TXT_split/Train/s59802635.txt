A pigtail drainage catheter has been placed into the left lower hemithorax since the prior examination with marked reduction in a loculated left-sided pleural effusion. However, there is considerable persistent opacification along the pleural surfaces of the left mid to lower lung as well asretrocardiac opacification. Associated with the presence of the catheter, there is now a small amount of air associated with the collection. Moderate interstitial abnormality appears increased in severity.
