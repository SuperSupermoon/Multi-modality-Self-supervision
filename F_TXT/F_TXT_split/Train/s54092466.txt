Endotracheal tube now terminates approximately 6.7 cm above the level of the carina, at the level of the superior aspect of the clavicles may be slightly high in position. Enteric tube is in appropriate position, coursing into the expected location of the stomach. In the interval since the prior study, there is now collapse of the right lower lobe with mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Aside from minimal left base atelectasis/ scarring, the left lung is clear. No large pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
