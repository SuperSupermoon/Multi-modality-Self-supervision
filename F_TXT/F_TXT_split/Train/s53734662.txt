The left internal jugular central line has been repositioned so that its tip now lies in the proximal SVC. The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular dual-lumen catheter are unchanged in position. The diffuse airspace process appears to have somewhat cleared, although there is a persistent opacity throughout both lungs and therefore this would favor resolving pulmonary edema rather than diffuse pneumonia or ARDS. Stable overall cardiac and mediastinal contours. No pneumothorax. Probable small bilateral layering effusions.
