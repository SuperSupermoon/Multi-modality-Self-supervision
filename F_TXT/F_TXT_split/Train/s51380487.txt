1. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. A portion of the right sided ventriculoperitoneal shunt is visualized. A right subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip in the proximal SVC. 2. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given marked patient rotation to the right on the current examination. There now appear to be some streaky linear opacities at the medial left lung base, which could reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or early pneumonia should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
