There has been an increase in right-sided pleural effusion with associated collapse of right upper and lower lobe. Right middle lobe appears partially inflated. There has been a corresponding mediastinal and cardiac shift to the right. Left lung volume is slightly decreased with worsened left basal atelectasis. Tracheostomy is seen in place with no obvious complication. A right IJ double-lumen catheter is seen terminating within the right atrium. A left IJ catheter is seen terminating within the low SVC. An NG tube is seen entering the stomach, courses through the pylorus and then terminates near the ligament of Treitz. There is extensive small bowel and stomach gas noted.
