A right apical chest tube has been placed to suction in the interval. Near resolution of a previously seen large right pneumothorax is noted. Minimal residual pleural air is seen laterally on the right. There is moderate pulmonary edema in the right lung which may be related to re-expansion. Small bibasilar effusions and atelectasis are likely. Chronic volume loss of the left lung secondary to left upper lobectomy is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain mildly enlarged, though unchanged from prior.
