Again, the patient is somewhat rotated. An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip terminates 6.5 cm above the level the carina. A Swan-Ganz catheter is in-situ, the tip is likely in the right main pulmonary artery. A chest tube and what appears to be a mediastinal tube are unchanged in position. A nasoenteric tube is seen to lie below the left hemidiaphragm, likely positioned in the stomach or duodenum. A breast prosthesis partially obscures the left hemi thorax. The widened mediastinum is unchanged. No definite pleural effusion seen. No pneumothorax seen.
