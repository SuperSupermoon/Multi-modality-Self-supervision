Superimposed trauma board limits detailed evaluation. The heart is of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours. There is calcification of the aortic knob. A 1.4-cm calcified round opacity overlying the left lung base may represent a chondral calcification, but a pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded. Lungs are otherwise clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A coronary stent is noted along the left heart border. There are multilevel degenerative changes along the spine.
