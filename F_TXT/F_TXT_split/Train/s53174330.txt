AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph ___ Several foci of heterogeneous consolidation at the right lung base are suggestive of pneumonia. Relatively mild cardiomegaly has improved substantially since ___, although some of the difference is due to rotation. Left lung is perfectly clear and there is no appreciable pleural effusion on either side nor any evidence of pulmonary edema. As far as one can tell on a single frontal view, the atrio-biventricular pacer/defibrillator leads follow their expected courses. No pneumothorax.
