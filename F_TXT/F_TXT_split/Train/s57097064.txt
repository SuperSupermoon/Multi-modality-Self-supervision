The distal part of a left-sided PICC has flipped upward coursing retrograde. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Perihilar fullness and hazy prominent pulmonary vascularity have mildly decreased. Small to moderate pleural effusions persist with patchy basilar opacities, not specific, although probably due to atelectasis with low lung volumes.
