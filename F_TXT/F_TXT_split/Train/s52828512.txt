Heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is unchanged, likely reflective of a trace left pleural effusion. Minimal atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal consolidation. No pneumothorax is present.
