Compared with the immediate prior radiograph, the left pleural effusion is substantially decreased with re-expansion of the left lung. There is a residual moderate left pleural effusion. The endotracheal tube ends 3.8 cm the carina, the right IJ central venous catheter ends in the lower SVC. The enteric tube ends within a decompressed stomach. There is probably a small to moderate right pleural effusion. There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
