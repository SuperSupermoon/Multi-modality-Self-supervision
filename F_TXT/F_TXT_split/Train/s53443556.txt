Interval placement of right-sided chest tube which is in appropriate position with new small anterior right pneumothorax and right-sided subcutaneous emphysema. Bilateral perihilar opacities likely represent a combination of vascular crowding and vascular congestion. Interval increase in heterogeneous opacity within the left lower lobe is most consistent with a pulmonary contusion however differential includes superimposed infection and aspiration. No large pleural effusion. Again seen are multiple right-sided rib deformities better assessed on outside hospital CT involving the right upper posterior ribs. No definite left-sided rib fracture seen.
