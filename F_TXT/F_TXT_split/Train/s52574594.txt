A right PICC is similar in configuration with the tip terminating in the proximal right atrium, which should be retracted 2.5-3 cm to place in the low SVC. The course of the line is unremarkable. The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent prior study. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. There is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is exaggerated due to AP technique and low lung volumes, but likely remains within normal limits and stable. There is partial calcification of the aortic knob. A healed right posterior rib fracture is redemonstrated.
