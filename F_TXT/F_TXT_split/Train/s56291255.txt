Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 7:53 p.m. There is substantial interval improvement of left perihilar and lower lobe opacity consistent with resolution of edema or aspiration. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
