AP chest compared to 2:32 a.m.: Feeding tube with the wire stylet in place passes beyond the upper stomach and out of view. A large right pleural effusion may have increased in the interim. Heart size top normal. Mediastinal veins are dilated, due in part to non-erect positioning, but suggestive of volume overload, since pulmonary vessels are also distended.
