As compared to ___ radiograph, lung volumes are lower with associated accentuation of cardiomediastinal contours in crowding of bronchovascular structures. New bibasilar patchy opacities have developed, left greater than right, which could potentially be due to developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, particularly at the left base. Aspiration is an additional consideration. Exam is otherwise remarkable for small left pleural effusion and linear atelectasis in the right lower lobe.
