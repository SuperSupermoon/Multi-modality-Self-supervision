Current study assessment demonstrates NG tube passing below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. No definitive endotracheal tube seen. As compared to the prior study, there is minimal change in the cardiomediastinal contour, sternal wire appearance and minimal bibasilar atelectasis. No current evidence of pulmonary edema is present, although vascular engorgement cannot be excluded. Slight progression of the left basal opacity might reflect different degree of atelectasis but attention to this area on subsequent studies is required to exclude the possibility of interval development of infection.
