AP chest compared to ___: Moderate cardiomegaly has increased since ___, and the upper mediastinum is appreciably wider, presumably due to engorged vessels, exaggerated in the semi-erect position. If there was an attempted central line placement, this would also raise concern for bleeding. If not, I would recommend repeat upright radiograph to see if there is reason to perform a CT scan for possible adenopathy. Left infrahilar consolidation could be atelectasis, recent aspiration, or even pneumonia. ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placements. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
