Endotracheal tube, right-sided Cordis introducer, mediastinal tubes and left-sided chest tube are again noted in unchanged positions. Nasogastric tube side-hole is probably just above the level of the gastroesophageal junction, unchanged. No pneumothorax is seen. There is unchanged obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and new haziness of the right hemidiaphragm suggesting overlying subsegmental atelectasis and some of this appears to be perihilar as well. Plain film appearance of the arch of the aorta is unchanged
