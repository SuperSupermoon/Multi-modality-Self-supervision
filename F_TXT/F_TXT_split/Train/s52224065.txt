The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. A relative paucity of vasculature in the lung apices is suggestive of emphysema. The main pulmonary arteries are prominent. Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen within the aortic arch. A left-sided pacemaker is seen with wires terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. The heart size is normal.
