As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The heart is markedly enlarged, the tip of the right internal jugular vein catheter projects over the right atrium and should be pulled back by approximately 2-3 cm. There is minimal improvement of the pulmonary edema, notably on the right. However, relatively extensive areas of atelectasis, notably on the right persist and there is a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion. Normal course of the nasogastric tube, the tip is not included in the image. No pneumothorax.
