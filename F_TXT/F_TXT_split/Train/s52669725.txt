Left lower lobe lobectomy was recently done for a subsolid nodule. A left chest tube projects in the lower third of the left hemithorax with minimal pneumothorax at the location. There is also adjacent subcutaneous air. Mild volume overload is accompanied with a slightly widened upper mediastinum and right upper lobe atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion.
