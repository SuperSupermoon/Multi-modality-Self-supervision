There is continued evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion not significantly changed. There is asymmetric density at the left lung base consistent with atelectasis and/or consolidation and likely pleural fluid. This finding is more pronounced than on the earlier study. Mediastinal structures are stable. An endotracheal tube, feeding tube, left subclavian catheter and right internal jugular catheter remain in place.
