In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. The tip of the left central catheter is at the level of the cavoatrial junction or possibly upper right atrium. There is some asymmetry of opacification at the left base. This could possibly represent posttraumatic hematoma. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
