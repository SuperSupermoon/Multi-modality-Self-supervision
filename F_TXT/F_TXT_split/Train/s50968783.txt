The inspiratory lung volumes are improved from the prior studies with persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left. There is evidence of minimal interstitial fluid overload with engorged pulmonary vasculature. Hazy opacification at the left lung base may represent attenuation of soft tissues. No pleural effusion or focal consolidation is seen. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent but stable in comparison to the prior study. The trachea is midline.
