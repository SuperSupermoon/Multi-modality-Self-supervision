AP chest compared to ___. Left pleural fluid is still considerable despite the multiplicity of pleural drains. There is no pneumothorax. Left basal atelectasis is substantial, but there is good aeration in the upper lung. On the right, vasculature is congested and the previous consolidative abnormality in the mid lung has nearly resolved. Skinfold should not be mistaken for a pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly unchanged. ET tube and left internal jugular line are in standard placements, while an upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced several centimeters to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction.
