Lung volumes remain low. A right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right atrium. Mild cardiomegaly persists with a left ventricular predominance. The mediastinal contour is slightly unfolded. Hilar contours are unchanged. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema. Myelomatous osseous lesions involving the ribs bilaterally as well as the thoracic spine appear grossly unchanged from the recent radiograph, and better assessed on the previous CT. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Cervical thoracic spinal fusion hardware is incompletely assessed.
