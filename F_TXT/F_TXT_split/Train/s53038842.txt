In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a Dobbhoff tube with the opaque portion just distal to the esophagogastric junction. Other monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. There are continued low lung volumes with multifocal areas of increased opacification that may be slightly more prominent than the previous study, consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
