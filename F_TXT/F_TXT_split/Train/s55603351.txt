Interval decrease in previous mild cardiomegaly, and in the severity of mild to moderate edema at least in the left lung, as well as caliber of the azygos vein could be due to real improvement in cardiac function, or the effect of positive pressure ventilator support. Heterogeneous opacification persists in the most of the right lung in the left lower lung. Whether edema or concurrent widespread pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate. Pleural effusion is small on the right if any. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements and a nasogastric drainage tube passes below the diaphragm and out. No pneumothorax. Findings were discussed et conference with the care team.
