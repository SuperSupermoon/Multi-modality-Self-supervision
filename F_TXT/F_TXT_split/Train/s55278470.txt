In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube again measures about 2 cm above the carina. It could be pulled back about 2 cm for more optimal positioning. There is increased opacification in the retrocardiac region with obscuration of the diaphragmatic contour, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. No definite mediastinal shift is appreciated.
