A nasogastric tube passes into the stomach, its distal course not imaged. There is again a right subclavian central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction. The catheter again passes through a right brachiocephalic stent. The heart is moderately enlarged. A moderate interstitial abnormality has worsened including perihilar fullness suggesting moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right. Vague density in the left lower lung suggests patchy atelectasis and a very small pleural effusion is possible on of the left.
