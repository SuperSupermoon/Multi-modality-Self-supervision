Lung volumes are extremely low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Predominantly linear opacities in both lower lobes favor atelectasis, particularly in the setting of low lung volumes. A more ill-defined area of opacity is observed in the right upper lobe, and is not fully characterized on this portable view. Followup PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful to evaluate for possible early focus of pneumonia in this region given clinical suspicion for infection. Prominence of the right infrahilar contour probably corresponds to areas of adjacent lymph nodes in the azygoesophageal recess demonstrated on previous CT of ___.
