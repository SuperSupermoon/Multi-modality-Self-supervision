As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are constant, with exception of an aortic balloon pump that has been newly inserted. The tip of the balloon pump projects approximately 5 cm below the apical aspect of the aortic arch. The endotracheal tube continues to be positioned very high, currently 6 cm above the carina. The tube could be advanced by approximately 2 cm. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinuses could suggest the presence of minimal pleural effusions. No new parenchymal opacities. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild fluid overload.
