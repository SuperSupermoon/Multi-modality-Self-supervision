Previous pulmonary edema, most easily seen in the left lung, has improved since ___ the pulmonary vascular congestion remains. Chronic severe elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged, although there is probably accompanying small right pleural effusion and atelectasis in the base of the chronically displaced right lung. Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged. Dual channel dialysis catheter ends in the right atrium. Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
