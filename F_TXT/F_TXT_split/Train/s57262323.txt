Comparison is made to the previous study from ___. There has been removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter. There is a new left-sided PICC line whose distal tip is in the mid-to-distal SVC. An aortic valve replacement is seen. The heart size is upper limits of normal. There is prominence of the mediastinum, which is stable. There is again seen a triangular area of increased density within the right upper lobe which likely represents loculated pleural fluid. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There are no signs of overt pulmonary edema.
