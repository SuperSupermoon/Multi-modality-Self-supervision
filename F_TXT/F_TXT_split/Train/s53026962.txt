As compared to ___ chest radiograph, lung volumes are lower with associated crowding of bronchovascular structures at the lung bases. No definite pneumonia, but PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for more complete assessment of the lung bases if clinical suspicion for infection persists. Persistent minimal blunting of left costophrenic sulcus may be due to pleural thickening or a small effusion.
