As compared to the previous radiograph, the left PICC line has been slightly pulled back. The curving and the tip of the line suggests malposition in the azygos vein. The line should be flushed and, potentially, repositioned. No pneumothorax. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions.
