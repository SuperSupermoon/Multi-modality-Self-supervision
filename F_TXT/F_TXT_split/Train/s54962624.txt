AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Although pulmonary consolidation has worsened appreciably in both lungs, moderate cardiomegaly is more severe and mediastinal veins more dilated, the marked asymmetry and consolidation strongly suggests worsening left pneumonia and perhaps a new pneumonia in the right lower lobe. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in a non-distended stomach. Moderate left and small-to-moderate right pleural effusions have increased. No pneumothorax.
