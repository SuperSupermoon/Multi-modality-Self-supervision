There is redemonstration of the enlarged cardiac silhouette, possibly related to cardiomegaly, though as previously mentioned pericardial effusion IS not excluded. There is increased prominence of the interstitial markings, particularly in the perihilar distribution, likely due to increased pulmonary edema. A moderately sized left pleural effusion is identical in appearance to chest radiogrpah performed 3 days earlier, though less apparent on intervening radiogrpah, likely due to positioning. Retrocardiac opacity likely represents a combination of effusion and atelectasis, though infectious process cannot be excluded. There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube. The central venous catheter terminates in the mid superior vena cava. No pneumothorax evident. Sternotomy sutures are midline and intact. No osseous abnormalities identified.
