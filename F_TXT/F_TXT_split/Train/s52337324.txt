Comparison is made with prior study ___. There are persistent low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is midline. Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable, though partially obscured by the lung abnormalities. There has been interval improvement of aeration in the right mid lung suggestive of improving atelectasis. Still there is a large opacity in the right lower lobe suggesting a large area of atelectasis or collapse. There is also right pleural effusion, stable. There is mild pulmonary edema. Right PICC tip is in the mid to low SVC.
