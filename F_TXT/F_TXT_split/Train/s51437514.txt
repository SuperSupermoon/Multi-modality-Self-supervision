1. Left subclavian central line has its tip in the mid SVC. Endotracheal tube has its tip 3.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Left basilar chest tube unchanged in position. A right basilar chest tube continues to have its side port within the chest wall outside of the pleural space. Lung volumes remain low but no focal airspace consolidation is seen. No large pneumothorax is seen on the supine film. However, note that the sensitivity of detecting pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
