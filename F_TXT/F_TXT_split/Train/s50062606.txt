Lung volumes are markedly low. There is opacity at the right apex with elevation of the minor fissure suggesting partial collapse of the right upper lobe. Patchy opacity in the retrocardiac area is also seen and may represent atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. As the left hemidiaphragm is partially obscured, there is possibly a small left effusion. The interstitium is prominent bilaterally but not significantly changed in appearance dating back to ___ favoring an underlying interstitial process rather than an acute infectious process. Clinical correlation is advised. Spinal hardware is again seen. No large pneumothorax.
