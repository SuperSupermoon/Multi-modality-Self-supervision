The patient is severely rotated, limiting evaluation. The left costophrenic angle not fully included on the image. Given this, the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. Difficult to exclude small right pleural effusion. Left base opacity could be due to atelectasis, but infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
