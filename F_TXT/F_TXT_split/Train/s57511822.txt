A single AP radiograph of the chest was acquired. Lung volumes are slightly low. A 2.6 cm rounded opacity projects over the left lower lung, not seen on the prior study from ___, possibly related to overlying musculoskeletal structures, although an intrathoracic process such as a pulmonary nodule, round atelectasis, or developing infection is not entirely excluded. The lungs are otherwise clear. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal. There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.
