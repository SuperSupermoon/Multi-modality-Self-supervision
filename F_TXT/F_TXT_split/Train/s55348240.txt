After relatively stable radiographic abnormalities in the the lower lungs ___ through ___, there is a new large scale heterogeneous consolidation on the left, due to pneumonia or acute pulmonary hemorrhage, and little change in probable atelectasis in the right lower lobe. Mild right perihilar opacification is equivocal, but could represent a second region of pneumonia. Heart is normal size. Pleural effusion is small to moderate the right if any, but stable. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard placement. Nasogastric tube can only be traced to the low esophagus, but the tip is indistinct. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC, right PIC line in the right atrium. There is no pneumothorax.
