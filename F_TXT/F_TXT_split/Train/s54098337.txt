Lung volumes are low, accounting for some bronchovascular crowding. Although assessment is limited due to leftward rotation of the patient, there is appearance of a bilateral hilar engorgement, more prominent in the right, with bilateral diffuse interstitial thickening and perihilar opacities. There might be a small right-sided pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis is present. The sternotomy wires are intact and mediastinal clips are unchanged in location.
