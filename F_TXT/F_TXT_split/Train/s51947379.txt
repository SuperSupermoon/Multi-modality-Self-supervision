In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung volumes in this patient with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and a dual-channel pacer device with leads in the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle. The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased. The area of right basilar opacification has decreased. However, there is still substantial opacification in the left mid and lower lung zones. This probably represents some combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis with possible asymmetric pulmonary edema and, in the appropriate clinical setting, the even some superimposed consolidation.
