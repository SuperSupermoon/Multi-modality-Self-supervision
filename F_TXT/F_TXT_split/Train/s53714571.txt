As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. This is manifested by increased interstitial markings, peribronchial cuffing, mild cardiomegaly, and increase in diameter of the pulmonary vasculature. No larger pleural effusions are currently seen. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
