In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of the left IJ pacer device with its tip in the region of the apex of the right ventricle. CoreValve replacement is seen. Some of the increased prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart reflects the AP supine position. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some increased pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification most likely reflects some postoperative atelectatic changes and possible small effusion.
