A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal tube which terminates in the mid to upper thoracic trachea, enteric tube which extends below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image, and a right subclavian central catheter, which terminates in the low SVC, all unchanged in position. There has been interval placement of a pigtail catheter which projects over the right lung base, with a decreased right pleural effusion. There is a small right apical pneumothorax. No focal consolidation is present. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
