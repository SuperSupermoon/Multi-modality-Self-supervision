Lung volumes are decreased, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature and cardiac contour. There is moderate cardiomegaly, which is stable. Complete retrocardiac opacification is indicative of lobar collapse, however superimposed infection is not excluded. Heterogeneous opacities in the right infrahilar region are concerning for infection. Small left pleural effusion is likely.
