Patient has had median sternotomy and two valve replacements, probably mitral and tricuspid. Severe cardiomegaly is stable since ___. In the lungs are multiple nodular opacities, some probably cavitated. At the lung bases there may be additional consolidation due to pneumonia. Small to moderate pleural effusions are present, pulmonary vasculature is generally engorged, accompanied by mild interstitial edema. Overall findings suggest disseminated septic emboli, perhaps from valvular vegetations of endocarditis. Correlation with echocardiography is recommended. I do not see any lobar collapse.
