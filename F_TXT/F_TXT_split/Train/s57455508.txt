Endotracheal tube ends approximately 3.3 cm above the carina and is appropriate. Right internal jugular line terminates at upper SVC and right subclavian line ends at cavoatrial junction/upper right atrium. Orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, the distal end is off the radiographic view. Since last 24 hours, there is no significant interval changes in the chest. Chest tubes on the right side terminating near the right hilus are unchanged in position. Right lower lung opacity secondary to loculated effusion and atelectasis and bilateral pulmonary congestion is similar in appearance. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No demonstrable pneumothorax.
