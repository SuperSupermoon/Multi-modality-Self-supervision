Single portable frontal supine chest radiograph was obtained. The heart is top normal in size and cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable. Linear streaky opacities at the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis. Opacification along the lateral border of the right lung with blunting of the right costophrenic angle could represent pleural thickening or a loculated effusion. There is also an ill-defined opacity in the right mid lung projecting over the anterior third rib. There is no pneumothorax. PA and lateral radiographs can be performed for further evaluation if the patient is amenable.
