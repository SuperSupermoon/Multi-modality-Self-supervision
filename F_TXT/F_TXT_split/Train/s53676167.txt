In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube appears to have been pulled back somewhat, with the tip now approximately 1.5 cm above the carina. In view of the position of the chin somewhat downward, the ET tube could be pulled back about 2 cm further to be in a safe position. Otherwise, little change with continued low lung volumes.
