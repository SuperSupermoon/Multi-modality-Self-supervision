Left-sided AICD device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle, and region of the coronary sinus. Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Widening of the mediastinum superiorly is unchanged. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, which may be accentuated by supine positioning, low lung volumes and AP technique. Low lung volumes are noted. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is otherwise demonstrated. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
