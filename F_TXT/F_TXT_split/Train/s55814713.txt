The tip of the endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position. A right chest tube is present with the tip in the right apex but no pneumothorax is present. Some subcutaneous emphysema on the right side is present, however. Low lung volumes and atelectasis is present particularly at the left base but no acute infiltrates are seen.
