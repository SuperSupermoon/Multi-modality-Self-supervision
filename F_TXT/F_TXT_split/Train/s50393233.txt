There is a persistent small to moderate right effusion with increasing airspace opacity more suggestive of atelectasis rather than an infectious process. Linear opacity in the left lower lung likely reflects scarring. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. The heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax.
