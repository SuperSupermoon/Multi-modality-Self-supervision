Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent small residual pneumothorax at the left lung apex and small areas of minimal aeration throughout the left hemithorax. There is dense consolidation of the left lung with an indeterminate amount of pleural effusion on the left side. There is a stable-appearing interstitial abnormality in the right lung which again may represent pulmonary edema versus dissemination of tumor. Again seen is a discrete metastatic mass in the right upper lobe.
