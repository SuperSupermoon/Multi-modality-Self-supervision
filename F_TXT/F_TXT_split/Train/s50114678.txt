As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in appearance of the monitoring and support devices. The lung volumes remain low but the lungs have increased in transparency, likely reflecting improved ventilation. No new focal parenchymal opacities. Unchanged minimal left pleural effusion with left retrocardiac atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
