There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum following recent bronchoscopic procedure. Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and stable compared to the prior exam. Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion is present as well as a bilateral subtle interstitial pattern, the latter likely reflecting the patient's known chronic interstitial lung disease although superimposed mild interstitial edema is also possible.
