The patient remains intubated. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach. A single-lead pacemaker, inserted via the inferior vena cava, terminates in the right ventricle, as before, and there is also a right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction. An aortic balloon pump has been removed. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Although a right perihilar opacity referring either to the right middle or lower lobe has substantially improved, there is an increased interstitial prominence suggesting mild vascular congestion, in addition to suspicion for a layering pleural effusion on the right, probably small to small-to-moderate in size. A retrocardiac opacity has increased, which is most commonly due to atelectasis.
