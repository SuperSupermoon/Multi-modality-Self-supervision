AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. The single exposure covers well the area of interest which is the left-sided apical chest area where resection of the first left-sided rib has been performed. Row of external metallic surgical clips indicates the surgical entrance at the anterior frontal chest wall in subclavicular area. Mid third portion of the first rib appears to have been removed. Pulmonary vascular structures extend well into the apical area and thus there is no evidence of pneumothorax. No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen.
