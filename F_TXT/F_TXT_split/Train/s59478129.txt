Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates right basilar atelectasis with small right pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. At the right lower lateral aspect of the thoracic cage, there is a subtle change in contour of the rib, possibly indicating the reported rib fracture, although oblique views are recommended for further characterization if rib fractures, if clinically indicated. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
