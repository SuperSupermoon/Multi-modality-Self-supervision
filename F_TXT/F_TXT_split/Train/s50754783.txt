Compared with the prior study, the previously seen right lung base pigtail catheter is no longer visualized. A moderate to moderately large right pneumothorax is newly visible. Possible small amount of fluid in the right costophrenic sulcus, unchanged. Prominence of the right hilum is again noted. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains grossly midline. Prominence of the superior mediastinum is also again noted. On the left, there is minimal upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. No focal infiltrate or effusion is identified in the left chest.
