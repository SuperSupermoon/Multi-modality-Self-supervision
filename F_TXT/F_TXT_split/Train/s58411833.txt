Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC. Median sternotomy wires appear intact. Pleural drains have been removed. Lung volumes remain low with bibasilar atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Faint lucency along the left heart border is diminishing, likely reflecting resolving pneumopericardium. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is improved. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
