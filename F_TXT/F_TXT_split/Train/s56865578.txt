Upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates clear lungs and normal hilar and cardiomediastinal contours. The increased apparent opacity in the right lower lung is due to a combination of minimal atelectasis, pulmonary vasculature, and prominent costochondral calcifications. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There are dense atherosclerotic calcifications in the aortic arch. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
