Right internal jugular venous introducer terminates in upper SVC. Through the introducer, a temporary pacer wire is placed with its tip terminating in right ventricle. Left lung base opacity is similar as before, likely due to lung base atelectasis and small pleural effusion. Mild pulmonary edema is stable. Known bilateral lung masses were better evaluated on prior CT. Increased right basilar opacity may be secondary to difference in layering of small right pleural effusion.
