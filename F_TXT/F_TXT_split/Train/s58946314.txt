Since ___, bilateral pneumothoraces, right greater than left, are appreciated. The right pneumothorax is seen 2.7 cm from the apex and extends laterally. The left pneumothorax is seen 2.2 cm from the apex. Lung volumes remain low with continued bibasilar atelectasis. Known right chest tube positioning is slightly changed. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Worsening marked subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest wall, may be due to positioning of the chest tube.
