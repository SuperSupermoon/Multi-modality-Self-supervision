A right-sided Port-A-Cath is noted with the tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction. There are slightly asymmetric lung volumes, left greater than right, but there is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is linear opacity in the right apex which is poorly characterized due to overlying external structures and portable technique. There is no pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Of note, there is a necklace overlying the upper mediastinum, but without significant obscuration of the underlying structures.
