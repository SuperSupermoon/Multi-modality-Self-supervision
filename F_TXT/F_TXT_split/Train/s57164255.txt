New right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Widespread consolidation in the left lung has slightly worsened, consistent with diffuse pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, although differential diagnosis includes massive aspiration and pulmonary hemorrhage in the appropriate clinical settings. Small left pleural effusion is also demonstrated.
