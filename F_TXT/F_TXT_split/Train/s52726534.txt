AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a previous similar study of ___. Chest findings are grossly within normal limits. Again an NG tube can be identified; however, as the image limits I do not include the lower portion of the abdomen, the precise termination point of the NG tube cannot be identified. It can however be stated that the tube passes well throughout the esophagus and reaches the stomach area. The side port seen at the terminal portions of the line point towards the right suggesting that the tube is located in the antrum of the stomach. When comparison is made with the next previous examination, a Dobbhoff tube was placed, terminating in similar position. The limitation of our examination cannot identify the type of the tube.
