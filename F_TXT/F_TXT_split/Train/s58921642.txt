As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of pulmonary hypertension. In addition, however, there is increasing localized radiodensity at the bases and lateral aspect of the right upper lobe and in the retrocardiac lung regions. The findings are highly suggestive for multifocal pneumonia. Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
