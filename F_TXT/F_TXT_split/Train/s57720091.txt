As compared to ___ radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Bilateral pleural effusions appear decreased in size, and there is no definite pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. Worsening confluent opacities in the perihilar and basilar regions, possibly due to reported history of aspiration event superimposed upon pre-existing areas of lower lobe atelectasis and or consolidation. Free intraperitoneal air is noted within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, possibly due to recent gastrostomy tube placement, but clinical correlation suggested to exclude the possibility of a perforated abdominal viscus. Widespread posttraumatic deformities have been more fully evaluated by cross-sectional imaging.
