Single AP erect portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated to the right. Again there are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Slight left base opacity most likely relates to accentuated markings from lowlung volumes, although underlying consolidation is not excluded. Recommend dedicated PA and lateral views when/if patient able. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
