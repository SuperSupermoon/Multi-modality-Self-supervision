A left anterior chest pacemaker defibrillator is again seen with tips terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle in unchanged positions. Again seen is a right PICC line with tip terminating in the upper to mid SVC and a left ventricular assist device in stable position. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with moderate cardiomegaly involving the right atrium, the left atrium, and the left ventricle. A left base consolidation, likely representing a combination of atelectasis and partly loculated pleural effusion, is essentially stable compared to the most recent prior study. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. There is no new focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
