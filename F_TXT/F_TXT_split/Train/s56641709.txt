Low lung volumes are present. Heart size remains markedly enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted diffusely within the aorta. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present as result of low lung volumes. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are mild multilevel degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine.
