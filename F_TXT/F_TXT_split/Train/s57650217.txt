AP portable upright view of the chest. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing 2.3 cm above the carina. The endogastric tube descends into the left upper quadrant. A left chest wall pacer device is noted with leads extending to the region of the right atrium and right ventricle. Retrocardiac vague linear densities are noted which could reflect atelectasis though difficult to exclude a component of aspiration. Otherwise the lungs appear grossly clear. No definite signs of effusion or pneumothorax. No signs of congestion or edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears within normal limits allowing for technique. Bony structures appear intact.
