Intra-aortic balloon pump has been advanced and now terminates about 4.1 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. Other support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and there is stable widening of cardiomediastinal contours. Pulmonary vascular congestion is present, but pulmonary edema has decreased in extent since the previous study, and bibasilar atelectasis has also slightly improved. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
