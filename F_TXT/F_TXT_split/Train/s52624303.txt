The patient has been intubated with endotracheal tube tip terminating about 2.4 cm above the carina. Low lung volumes and portable technique accentuate the cardiomediastinal contours. Even allowing for this factor, there appears to be mild cardiac enlargement accompanied by vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness suggesting mild edema. Multifocal patchy and linear opacities are present in the right mid and lower lungs and probably reflect atelectasis, but coexisting aspiration is possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
