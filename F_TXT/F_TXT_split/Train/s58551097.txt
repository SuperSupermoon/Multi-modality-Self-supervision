There has been significant improvement in the bilateral interstitial and alveolar densities as compared to yesterday's film. There is some persistent density in the right base and a small area of density is seen in the left base. Given the rapid transition, it is possible that this represents atypical pulmonary edema/fluid overload. This should be correlated with the patient's intervening therapy. There are no new areas of consolidation. There is no pneumothorax. The central line is unchanged.
