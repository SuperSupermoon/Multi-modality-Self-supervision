There has been interval placement of the right internal jugular central venous with tip in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is present. Endotracheal and enteric tubes remain in unchanged positions. Lung volumes remain low. Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear similar with mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette again noted. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is re- demonstrated with minimal upper zone vascular redistribution. Patchy opacities in the lung bases persist and may reflect atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also likely present.
