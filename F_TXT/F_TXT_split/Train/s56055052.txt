Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 1.4 cm above the level of the carina, should be withdrawn at least 1-2 cm for more optimal positioning. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing to the left upper quadrant, within the expected position of the stomach. Coarse calcifications projecting over the right mid lung may represent pleural plaque. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The bones are diffusely osteopenic without acute fracture seen. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Cardiac silhouette is not top normal.
