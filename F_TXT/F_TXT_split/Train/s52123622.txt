Cardiac silhouette is normal in size. Patchy opacities are present at both lung bases medially, with overall interval decrease in extent compared to the prior radiograph. This may represent resolving atelectasis, recurrent aspiration or resolving infection. No new areas of consolidation are identified elsewhere in the lungs, and there is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
