Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Lung volumes are low. Mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with perihilar haziness, new from the recent study. Small bilateral pleural effusions persist. Bibasilar airspace opacities, more so in the retrocardiac region, appear slightly progressed from the prior study earlier today, either reflecting worsening atelectasis or infection. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
