Right mid to lower lung opacity is worrisome for large pneumonia. Subtle opacity projecting over the right upper lung could be a second site of infection. The left lung is clear. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
