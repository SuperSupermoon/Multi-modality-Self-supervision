Previous right pleural effusion and traumatic changes to the superior segment of the right lower lobe have improved. The basal segments are still partially consolidated, and there is still some adjacent hemo thorax, no larger today. There is no pneumothorax, and the small volume of pleural or extrapleural bleeding associated with the posterior upper rib fractures is unchanged. Left lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements. The upper enteric drainage tube ends in the mid esophagus would have needed to be advanced at least 20 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach, but was repositioned as of a chest radiograph performed 05:30 today, available the time of this review.
