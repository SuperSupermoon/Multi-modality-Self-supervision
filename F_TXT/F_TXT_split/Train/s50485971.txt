AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day. During the examination interval, a right-sided pgi-tail catheter has been placed advanced through the lower lateral chest wall and partially opened. The pigtail end occupies the right lower lung field. No remaining pneumothorax on the right base. The tiny residual pneumothorax in the apical area seen on the preceding examination cannot be identified anymore. No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen. Abandoned pacemaker cable in right axillary area as before.
