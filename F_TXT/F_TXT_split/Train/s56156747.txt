Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is seen. Prominence of the perihilar vasculature suggests moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. There is increase in left mid to lower lung opacity which may be related to worsening pulmonary vascular congestion in combination with left-sided pneumonia. No large pleural effusion is seen although a small left pleural effusion be difficult to exclude. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
