Interval placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter with tip terminating in the interlobar portion of the right pulmonary artery with no visible pneumothorax. ECMO cannula is visible coursing from the inferior vena cava through the right atrium to terminate in the expected location of the lower superior vena cava. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. Widespread diffuse pulmonary opacities have slightly improved although differences in lung volumes contribute in part to this apparent change.
