AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Observed that a PA lateral chest examination was performed during this examination interval on ___ with patient in upright position. At that time, existing air-fluid levels in the pleural space could not be assessed. Again the previously described left-sided chest wall emphysema remains and makes identification of a possible remaining small pneumothorax in the left hemithorax impossible. The findings on the portable chest examinations are rather unchanged and there is a mild degree of left-sided mediastinal shift suggesting volume loss, atelectasis in the left-sided pulmonary changes. The right-sided hemithorax remains unremarkable with normal pulmonary vasculature and absence of any fluid accumulation in the right pleural sinus. No new infiltrates.
