Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Fiducial marker is again seen overlying the right upper chest with underlying large opacity in this patient with known malignancy, grossly similar to prior. Increased interstitial markings in a background of pulmonary emphysema are again seen. The lungs remain hyperinflated. Patient's known left-sided chain sutures are obscured by overlying external artifact. No definite new focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is diffuse osteopenia. Sclerotic foci projecting over the left glenoid and partially imaged proximal left humerus are stable.
