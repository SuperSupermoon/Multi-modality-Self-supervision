The endotracheal tube is 2.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is seen with its tip in a decompressed stomach. A previously seen left internal jugular line is in the proximal SVC and unchanged. Also seen is a large-bore right internal jugular catheter that overlies the right atrium and is unchanged. There is generalized vascular engorgement consistent with mild biventricular decompensation. There is a persistent left lower lobe opacity, which is similar in appearance to the prior study. The hilar contours are normal. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
