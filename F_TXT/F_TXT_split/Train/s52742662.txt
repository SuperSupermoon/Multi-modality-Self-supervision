As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. This decrease is more noticeable on the post-surgical right than on the left side. On the left, there is mildly increasing pleural effusion and subsequent areas of atelectasis. In the ventilated parts of the left lung, there is no evidence of infectious abnormality.
