Single AP view of the chest demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal, hilar, and cardiac contours. There is retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and blunting of the left costophrenic angle, likely represents combination of atelectasis and layering pleural effusion, though cannot exclude underlying consolidation due to pneumonia. Slightly increased patchy opacity in the right lower lung may represent atelectasis, though again cannot exclude infectious process.
