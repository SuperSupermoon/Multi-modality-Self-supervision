New ET tube in standard placement. Left subclavian line ends at the origin of the SVC. Right jugular introducer ends in the neck, both unchanged. Lung volumes have improved and heart size has decreased, probably a function of positive pressure ventilator support. Severe bilateral pulmonary consolidation with an upper lobe predominance, progressing over the preceding 48 hr could be pulmonary edema or severe pneumonia and/or pulmonary hemorrhage. Moderate pleural effusions are probably present, but heart size is normal. . Mediastinal venous engorgement suggests elevated central venous pressure or volume, but is also due to supine positioning. No pneumothorax.
