Single portable AP view through the chest demonstrates cardiomegaly. Cephalization of vasculature, as well as diffuse patchy opacities, particularly to lateral to the right hilum, is reflective of mild pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. A radiopaque tubular structure is identified projecting over the left neck soft tissues.
