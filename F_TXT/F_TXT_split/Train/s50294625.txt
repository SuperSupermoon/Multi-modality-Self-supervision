An endotracheal tube is 2 cm from the carina. A nasoenteric catheter tip is not fully imaged, though is at least below the diaphragm. Left approach central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC, unchanged. Complete lobar collapse of the left lower lobe has decreased. However, opacity within the left base persists and is likely a combination of partial left lower lobe collapse and a moderate effusion. A new opacity in the medial right lung base may be due to interval atelectasis or aspiration. The upper lungs are clear. There is no overt edema. No pneumothorax is evident. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
