Comparison is made with prior studies ___. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. There are persistent lower lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Left lower lobe opacity has increased, consistent with worsening atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Right middle lobe atelectasis has increased. Right upper lobe faint opacity is grossly unchanged, likely pneumonia.
