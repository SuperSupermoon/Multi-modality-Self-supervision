AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph obtained. As seen previously, there is a left IJ central venous catheter with its tip unchanged in the expected location of the superior vena cava. Lung volumes remain low with an elevated right hemidiaphragm again seen. There is improved aeration in the left lower lung with probable residual left basilar atelectasis. No large effusion is seen. Upper lungs are well aerated. Clips in the right upper quadrant noted.
