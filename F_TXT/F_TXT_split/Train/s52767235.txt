Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube tip now is 4.8 cm above the crania in a standard position. Right subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Increasing opacities in the right lower lobe are consistent with increasing small pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Cardiac size is obscured by the pleural abnormalities. There is atelectasis in the left lower lobe associated with small-to-moderate left pleural effusion which has increased. There is mild vascular congestion.
