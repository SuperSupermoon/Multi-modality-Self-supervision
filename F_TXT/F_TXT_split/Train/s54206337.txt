Lung volumes are low. The heart size remains mildly enlarged, but this may be accentuated by low lung volumes. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. No definite focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
