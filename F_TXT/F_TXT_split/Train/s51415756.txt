As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient was intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 1.6 cm above the carina. The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable. No evidence of pneumothorax. The very extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely combines to moderate pleural effusions, have further increased in extent and severity.
