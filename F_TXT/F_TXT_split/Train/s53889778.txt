There has been significant interval worsening in the right upper lobe airspace opacity now affecting the entirety of the right upper and the right lower lobe. There is likely involvement of the right middle lobe also. A atelectasis versus consolidation in the left lower lobe. An endotracheal tube is in-situ. The tip is difficult to visualize but is estimated at 4 cm above the level of the carina. A nasoenteric tube terminates in the stomach. Calcification of the left ventricular wall is noted. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions. There is minimal subcutaneous emphysema along the left lateral chest wall and at the base of the neck. This is decreased when compared the prior study.
