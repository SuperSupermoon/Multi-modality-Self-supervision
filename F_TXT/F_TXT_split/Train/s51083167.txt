Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained. Prominence of the right heart and mediastinum may reflect an enlarged aorta. Increased interstitial opacity in the lungs may reflect chronic pulmonary disease without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Mild vascular congestion is seen, without overt edema. Mid right clavicular fracture is seen without evidence of additional bony injury, though if specific symptoms, dedicated rib views may be of help. Cardiac silhouette is top normal with a rounded retrocardiac opacity reflecting a moderate hiatal hernia.
