Hazy right basilar opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm could be due to combination of layering effusion and atelectasis noting that infection is not excluded. Similarly left basilar opacity in the retrocardiac region on laterally could be atelectasis or infection. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities.
