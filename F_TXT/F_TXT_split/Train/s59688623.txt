There are extremely low lung volumes and the patient is rotated to the right. Right-sided PICC is seen, terminating in the distal SVC. There is a midline tracheostomy tube. Further increased indistinctness of the vessels suggests worsening pulmonary vascular congestion; however, this may at least in part relate to lower lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis, although a small left pleural effusion may be present.
