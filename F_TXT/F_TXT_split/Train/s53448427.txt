Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 6.9 cm above the carina and could be withdrawn slightly for standard positioning. This is not appreciably changed since the prior study. Feeding tube continues to terminate in the proximal stomach. Interval improved aeration at left lung base with minor residual atelectasis and small residual pleural effusion. Persistent patchy right infrahilar opacity, most likely due to atelectasis and less likely a focal pneumonia.
