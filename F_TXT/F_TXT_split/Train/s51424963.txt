Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted. There continues to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Lung volumes are low with patchy opacities in lung bases most likely reflective of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Remote fracture of the right seventh posterior rib is noted.
