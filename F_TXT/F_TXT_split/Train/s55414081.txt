Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding. The region of opacification of the left upper and lower lobes, corresponding to pleural effusion and atelectasis seen on CT from ___, has decreased in size over the interval. There are moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Multiple overlying surgical clips and intact sternotomy wires are seen. Calcification of the both diaphragmatic pleura is unchanged and consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
