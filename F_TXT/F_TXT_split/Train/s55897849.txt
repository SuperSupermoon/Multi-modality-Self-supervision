There is prominence of the aortic knob with mild calcification. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise within normal limits. Lungs are well expanded. Note is made of increased retrocardiac opacity and atelectasis at the right lung base. There is no significant pneumothorax or large pleural effusion in this single frontal chest radiograph.
