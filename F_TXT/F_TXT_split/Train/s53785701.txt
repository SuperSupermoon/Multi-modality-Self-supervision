The lungs are well expanded. Mild bibasilar opacities are seen, left greater than right, which could represent pneumonia. Rounded opacity in the lateral left lung base is again seen, consistent with lipoma seen on prior CT. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
