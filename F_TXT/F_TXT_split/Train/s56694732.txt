AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Relatively high positioned diaphragm suggests poor inspirational effort and resultant crowded appearance of pulmonary vasculature at the bases. There is no evidence of new discrete local parenchymal infiltrates. As the lateral pleural sinuses have an acute appearance, significant pleural effusion is unlikely. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area as can be identified on this portable chest examination. When comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___, the findings were quite normal in this patient who had suffered from intermittent chest tightness and palpitations. There was no evidence of parenchymal or interstitial abnormalities.
