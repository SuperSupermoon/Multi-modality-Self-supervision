Rotated positioning. This limits assessment of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present. This overlies a rounded focus of air which is thought to represent gas within a large hiatal hernia. There is associated elevation of left hemidiaphragm and overlying left base atelectasis. The left lung apex appears grossly clear. Left mid zone is considerably obscured due to rotation, but the possibility of pleural fluid at the left base cannot be excluded. On the right, there is new opacity, particularly in the right mid and lower zones. This in part represents vascular plethora, but the right hemidiaphragm is now obscured suggesting a pleural effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. No pneumothorax is identified.
