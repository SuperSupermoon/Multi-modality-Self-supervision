AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained nine hours earlier during the same day. Comparison of the two similar studies does not disclose any interval change. Thus, again no reoccurrence of a left-sided apical pneumothorax in this patient with a pigtail drainage catheter in place. Heart size unchanged. No pulmonary vascular congestion. Hazy densities on the lung bases consistent with bilateral pleural effusion blunting the lateral pleural sinuses. Bilateral lower thorax rib fractures similar in appearance as can be identified on single chest view.
