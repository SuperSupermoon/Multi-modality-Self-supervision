The right internal jugular central line now has its tip in the distal SVC. The nasogastric tube continues to course below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach and the side port just below the gastroesophageal junction. Endotracheal tube has its tip 3.5 cm above the carina. Lungs are well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
