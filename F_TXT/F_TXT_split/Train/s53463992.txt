AP chest compared to ___, 3:09 a.m.: New opacification at the left lung base is either pleural effusion or of greater concern, new consolidation. There is also a contribution of overlying skinfolds, and I would strongly recommend repeat upright chest radiograph with care taken not to introduce a skinfold artifact. Patient has had left upper thoracoplasty, leaving an extremely small residual of aerated lung in the left hemithorax. Heart size is normal. Dr. ___ was paged and I discussed the findings with the physician who responded.
