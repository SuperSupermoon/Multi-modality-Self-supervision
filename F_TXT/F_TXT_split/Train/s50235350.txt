The patient is status post mitral valve replacement. The heart is mildly enlarged. A focal opacity projects over the right lower lung, worrisome for pneumonia, with more vague multifocal opacities seen in the right upper and left lower lungs, worrisome for multifocal pneumonia. These focal opacities are visualized within a background of indistinct upper zone prominence of pulmonary vessels suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion.
