Compared to earlier the same day, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen are low inspiratory volumes and increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Also again seen is some increased density in the right cardiophrenic region, unchanged. There is mild vascular plethora and faint hazy density, also similar to the prior study.
