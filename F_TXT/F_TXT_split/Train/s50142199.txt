As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has a tracheostomy tube. Previously malpositioned Dobbhoff catheter in the right bronchial system is removed, the Dobbhoff catheter now shows a normal course and the tip of the catheter is not visualized on the image. The other monitoring and support devices are constant. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and signs of mild interstitial lung edema. The co-existing infectious process cannot be excluded and is not more severe than on the previous image. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
