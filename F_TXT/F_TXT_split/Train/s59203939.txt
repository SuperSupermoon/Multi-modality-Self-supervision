Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. Enteric tube is seen with its tip and side port in the stomach. Lung volumes are low. The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is diffusely calcified. There is no pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities are noted in both lung bases. These could reflect areas of atelectasis, but infection is not excluded. No large pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen on this supine exam. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
