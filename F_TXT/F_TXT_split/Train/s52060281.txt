Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Underlying trauma board and other overlying external artifact partially obscure the view. Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. Slight prominence of the superior mediastinum is likely accentuated by supine, AP technique. No displaced fracture is seen.
