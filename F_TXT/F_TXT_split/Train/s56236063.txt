Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of view. There are low lung volumes. Bilateral perihilar opacities suggest mild pulmonary edema. Left base opacity may be due to pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying aspiration not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen.
