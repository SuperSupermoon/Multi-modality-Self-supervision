There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. There is interval increase and bilateral, left greater than right, a mid to lower lung alveolar opacities with a possible more apparent opacity projecting over the right upper lung. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured which may be due to left basilar consolidation although underlying pleural effusion is not excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unremarkable.
