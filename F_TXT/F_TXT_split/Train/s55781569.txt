There is a new 7 cm rounded opacity projecting just to the left of the aortic arch which was not present on prior. Silhouette of the aortic arch and proximal descending aorta is preserved as is the left pulmonary artery. Linear left basilar consolidation is noted with new elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. There is also moderate hiatal hernia. The right lung is grossly clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
