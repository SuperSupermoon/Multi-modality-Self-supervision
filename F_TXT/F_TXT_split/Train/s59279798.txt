As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Tracheostomy with unchanged tube position. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, atelectasis at both the left and right lung bases. A medial basal opacity on the right, likely reflecting old aspiration, is unchanged in location, extent and severity. No overt pulmonary edema. No evidence of recent infection.
