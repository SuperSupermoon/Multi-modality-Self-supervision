Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Postoperative mediastinal widening is stable. Severe cardiomegaly cannot be evaluated. Increasing opacities in the left lower lobe are consistent with increasing atelectasis and large left effusion, probably stable. Vascular congestion has improved. Amount of right effusion is difficult to evaluate, likely small. Right lower lobe atelectasis are unchanged. Sternal wires are aligned.
