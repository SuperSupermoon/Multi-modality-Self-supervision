Left chest tube remains in place with only a tiny residual left apical pneumothorax remaining. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Asymmetrically distributed perihilar opacities have improved on the left and are unchanged on the right. Moderate right pleural effusion appears slightly larger, but could potentially be accentuated by differences in patient's positioning. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
