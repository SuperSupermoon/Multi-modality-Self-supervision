AP chest compared to ___ and ___, performed elsewhere: A new left IJ line projects over the origin of the SVC. There is no mediastinal widening or pneumothorax. Very large left pleural effusion causing atelectasis of nearly the entire left lung, preceded the line placement, although it is larger than it was nine hours ago. Right lung is essentially clear, aside from the expected degree of redirected blood flow. Left heart border is obscured by the effusion and heart size is indeterminate.
