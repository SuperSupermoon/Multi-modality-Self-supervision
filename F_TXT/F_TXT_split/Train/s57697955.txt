Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. As compared to the prior study, there is no appreciable change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette appearance as well as in the lung with no evidence of substantial pulmonary edema seen. The right pigtail catheter has been exchanged by a chest tube with small amount of pneumothorax still present. Substantial amount of subcutaneous air is noted on the left that might be consistent with the air leak. Air bronchogram in the left lower lobe is consistent with left lower lobe consolidation, atelectasis versus infection in the presence of appropriate clinical findings. Small amount of left pneumothorax is present as well.
