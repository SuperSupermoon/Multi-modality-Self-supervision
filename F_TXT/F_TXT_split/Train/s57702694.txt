In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The degree of subcutaneous gas is decreasing. Opacification at the left base again is consistent with some combination of volume loss in the left lower lobe and layering pleural fluid. The possibility of superimposed pneumonia cannot be easily excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some over hydration. No evidence of substantial pneumothorax.
