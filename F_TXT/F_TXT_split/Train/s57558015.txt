As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube is in unchanged position. In the interval, the patient has received a right central venous access line. Its course is unremarkable, its tip is projecting over the upper SVC. The position of the ___ tube is unchanged. In the interval, the patient has undergone bronchoscopy, and there is no reexpansion of the left lung. However, in the perihilar and retrocardiac lung areas, there are alveolar opacities, likely reflecting re-expansion edema. No larger left or right pleural effusions. The mediastinal and cardiac silhouettes have returned to their near normal positions.
