AP chest compared to ___: Supine positioning accounts in large part for distention of mediastinal veins. Given this artifact, heart is probably normal size, and lungs though low in volume are clear. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Tip of the endotracheal tube is just above the thoracic inlet, approximately 7.5 cm from the carina and could be advanced 3 cm for more secure seating.
