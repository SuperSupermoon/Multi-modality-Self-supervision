The patient is rotated. The lungs are hyperexpanded, consistent with background chronic pulmonary disease. Interstitial edema is mild. Central pulmonary vascular congestion is also mild. The heart is mildly enlarged given the hyperexpanded lungs. Blunting of the left greater than right costophrenic angle suggests probable trace pleural effusions. Tiny amount of fluid tracks in the minor fissure. No definite focal consolidation. No pneumothorax. The mediastinum is not widened. Aortic knob calcifications are mild. Slight asymmetric opacity along the left lateral mid hemi thorax just below the tip of the scapula persists and may reflect a developing pneumonia (was previously obscured by external ventillation device). No acute osseous abnormality.
