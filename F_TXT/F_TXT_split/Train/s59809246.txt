A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. Aeration of both lungs has improved since the preceding series of radiographs, most recently from ___:50. There is residual airspace opacity at both lung bases. The hila are indistinct and there is peribronchial cuffing. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured by retrocardiac opacity. There are no abnormal cardiac or mediastinal contours.
