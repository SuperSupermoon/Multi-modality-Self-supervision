As compared to the previous radiograph, the appearance of the cardiac silhouette, including the enlarged para-aortic space, is unchanged. Pre-existing signs of mild fluid overload might have minimally increased. Atelectatic changes in the retrocardiac lung areas and at the right and left lung base, but no evidence of newly occurred parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Left internal jugular vein catheter is unchanged.
