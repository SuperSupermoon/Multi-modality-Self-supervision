Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a stable cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature. Prominent bilateral hila are noted, corresponding to lymphadenopathy seen on recent CT. Since the prior examination, there is a left basilar opacity. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Clips are seen in the right axilla. Linear radiopaque density projecting over the right supraclavicular region, presumably external.
