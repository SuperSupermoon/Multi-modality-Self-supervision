Opacities in left mid and lower and right infrahilar regions are more confluent on this exam, possibly somewhat accentuated by technical differences. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. The aorta is again noted to be densely calcified. The azygos vein is dilated, measuring 18 mm, slightly increased compared with the prior study and suggestive of right heart failure. No gross effusions are identified. No pneumothorax is detected . Catheter/ tubing again noted over the upper abdomen immediately to the left of midline.
