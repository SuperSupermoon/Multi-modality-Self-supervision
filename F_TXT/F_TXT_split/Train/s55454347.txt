Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval removal of a left transjugular central venous catheter and a left-sided chest tube in the interim. Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes. There is increased right sided atelectasis. Vague left apical opacity likely reflects atelectasis, minimally increased since prior exams. Dense retrocardiac opacities persist, compatible with atelectasis. There is a moderate left pleural effusion. The right lung is well aerated. There is no discernible pneumothorax.
