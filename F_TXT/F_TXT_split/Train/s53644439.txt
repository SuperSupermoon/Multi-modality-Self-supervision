Left PICC ends in the proximal to mid SVC. Median sternotomy wires are present. Moderate cardiomegaly, mildly increased from prior. Interstitial edema persists, similar to prior. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, consistent with a left-sided pleural effusion. Retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis. A rounded density in the left upper lobe likely corresponds to mass seen on prior CT scan. There is no pneumothorax.
