Since the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, pulmonary vascular congestion and mild perihilar edema have worsened, accompanied by probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Enlargement of the hila compared to ___ radiograph and 08:47 is probably due to vascular engorgement accentuated by patient rotation, but standard PA and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful to confirm this impression once the patient's condition permits. No other relevant changes since recent study.
