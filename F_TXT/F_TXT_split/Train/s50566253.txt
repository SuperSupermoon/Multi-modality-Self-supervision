A left internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and upper SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low resulting in bronchovascular crowding. Basilar atelectasis is likely. No large pleural effusions are evident. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are exaggerated due to the AP technique.
