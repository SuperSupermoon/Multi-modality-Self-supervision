The ET tube tip lies slightly above the level of the clavicular heads approximately 4.2 cm above the carina. The right subclavian central line tip overlies the cavoatrial junction. An NG tube is present. Due to underpenetration is difficult to trace through the lower mediastinum into the abdomen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Again seen are diffuse patchy opacities in both lungs. The distribution and density appears similar to the prior study. The foci themselves appear slightly less distinct, but I suspect this is predominantly due to technique and slight motion.
