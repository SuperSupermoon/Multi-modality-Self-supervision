Left pleural drainage catheter has been withdrawn to the level of the right third anterior interspace. I cannot be sure it is actually intra thoracic. Right pneumothorax is tiny. No right pleural effusion. Mild bibasilar atelectasis, slightly greater on the right, unchanged. Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.
