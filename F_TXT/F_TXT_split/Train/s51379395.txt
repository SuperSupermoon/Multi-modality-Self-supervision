Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.3 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube is seen terminating in the distal esophagus with sideport also in the distal esophagus. There is a right internal jugular central venous catheter, which terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. There is consolidation projecting over the majority of the right lung, which could be due to pulmonary hemorrhage, massive aspiration, and/or extensive infection. Left perihilar opacities are also seen, which could be due to aspiration or infection or a component of pulmonary edema. Left base opacity is seen, which may be due to atelectasis with possible small underlying pleural effusion. No large pleural effusion is seen on the right. There are no findings to suggest pneumothorax. No definite rib fractures are seen.
