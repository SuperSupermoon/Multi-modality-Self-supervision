Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. The heart size is upper limits of normal. There are opacities bilaterally. This is unchanged. There is left retrocardiac opacity. Known pulmonary nodules, mostly within the left lung seen on the prior CT scan, are not well appreciated due to the overlying infiltrates.
