ET tube is in standard placement. Lower lung volumes may account in part for mild progressive widening of the postoperative mediastinal silhouette in the region of the aortic knob. It may also explain the apparent increase in radiopacity in the left lower lobe, although the right lower lobe has improved, reflecting decreasing edema. This area should be watched for possible atelectasis or even pneumonia. No pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion is seen. Left PIC line ends at the origin of the SVC. Nasogastric feeding tube passes into the stomach and I will review. Right transjugular right ventricular pacer lead follows the expected.
