Since the radiograph of ___, a right pleural catheter has been removed, with no visible pneumothorax. Diffuse pulmonary opacities are similar to the prior radiograph, with the exception of worsening opacity in the left retrocardiac region. This probably represents atelectasis in the setting of an enlarging adjacent pleural effusion. No other relevant change.
