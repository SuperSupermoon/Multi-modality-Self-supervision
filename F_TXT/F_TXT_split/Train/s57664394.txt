Again seen is left apical pigtail pleural drainage catheter, unchanged in position. There has been interval improvement of pulmonary edema. Moderate right pleural effusion with associated right lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion are mostly unchanged. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.
