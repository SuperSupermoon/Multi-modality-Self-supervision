AP chest compared to ___: A new large area of consolidation at the base of the right lung is most likely pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Large hiatus hernia is responsible for much of the retrocardiac opacification, but there is also chronic or recurrent left lower lobe atelectasis making it difficult to exclude pneumonia on that side. The upper lungs are clear. Upper esophagus is distended with air. Heart size is normal and there is no evidence of cardiac decompensation.
