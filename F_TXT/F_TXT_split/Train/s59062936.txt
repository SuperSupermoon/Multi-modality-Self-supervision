Nasoenteric tube is coiled in the stomach. Right pigtail catheter is unchanged in position. Small right apical pneumothorax appears similar. Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged, although better delineation of the left hemidiaphragm suggests interval re-expansion of the left lung. A left internal jugular central venous catheter is at the level of the lower SVC. Right Port-A-Cath catheter is in the proximal right atrium.
