Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right atrium. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach. Heart size is normal. Aortic knob is diffusely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Interstitial opacities are seen within the left upper lung field, findings which could reflect chronic changes. Similarly, linear opacities within both lung bases may reflect scarring or perhaps subsegmental atelectasis. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or large pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. Multiple fractures are seen involving the ribs bilaterally, left clavicle, and left proximal humerus, all which appear chronic.
