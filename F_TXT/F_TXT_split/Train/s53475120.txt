Lung volumes are low with increased density at the lung bases, left greater than right, which could represent atelectasis, but infiltrate cannot be excluded. Mild interstitial prominence is noted. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Curvilinear density projecting over the left lung field does not follow an anatomic course and therefore is most likely external to the patient. Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits
