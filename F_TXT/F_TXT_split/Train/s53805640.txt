AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. In addition, the patient tilts several degrees towards the right. The patient is intubated and ETT identified and seen to terminate in the trachea some 3 cm above the level of the carina. The area is overlying by a row of circular metallic suture wires indicating a previously performed sternotomy. There are additional multiple surgical clips in the superior mediastinal area indicating previous surgery. Detail cannot be evaluated on this single chest view examination. One can, however, identify a left-sided chest tube seen to terminate in the left apical area and there is no evidence of pneumothorax on either side. Lobular-shaped cardiac enlargement is noted and apparently metallic orthopedic hardware overlying the upper lumbar area suggestive of previous stabilizing device placement.
