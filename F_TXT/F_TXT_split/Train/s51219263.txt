The endotracheal tube terminates 3.7 cm above the carina. An enteric tube and Dobbhoff tube tip course along the esophagus and terminates out of field of view, likely within the stomach. A right subclavian catheter and left supraclavicular catheter both terminate in the mid superior vena cava. There is unchanged mild pulmonary edema with persistent collapse of the left lower lobe. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.
