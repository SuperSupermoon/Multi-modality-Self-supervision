Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous. The mediastinal contour is unchanged. The patient is status post left lower lobectomy with volume loss noted in the left lung and leftward shift of mediastinal structures as well as postsurgical changes seen in the left chest wall. As seen on the previous PET-CT, opacification about the left hilar region appears grossly similar accounting for differences in modality. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects pleural thickening and appears unchanged. Patchy opacity within the right lung base is new, and could reflect infection or aspiration is not excluded. Known right middle lobe nodular opacity is poorly assessed on this exam. The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. There is probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No pneumothorax is identified. Clips are seen projecting over the left lateral chest wall.
