As compared to the previous radiograph, free intra-abdominal air has decreased. The pre-existing small bilateral pleural effusions have slightly increased in extent. The areas of atelectasis at the lung bases have also increased. After intubation, the tip of the endotracheal tube is now projecting 3 cm above the carinal. The monitoring and support devices, including the right PICC line, the right internal jugular vein catheter and the feeding tube are in constant position. Mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
