Worsened and generalized opacification reflects, in part, tracheal extubation, but probably increasing pulmonary edema as well, superimposed on the multifocal infection and non cardiac edema in the lungs. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. Heart is normal size. Esophageal tube ends in the upper portion of the nondistended stomach and would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. Left internal jugular line ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax.
