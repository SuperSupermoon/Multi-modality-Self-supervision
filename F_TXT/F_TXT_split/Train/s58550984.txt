There has been interval advancement of the endotracheal tube, which now ends 5.8 cm above the carina. An esophageal catheter traverses below the diaphragm with tip projecting over the L2 vertebral body, likely within the distal stomach. The left costophrenic angle is not included in this image. Within this limitation, there is no evidence for focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Pulmonary edema has nearly resolved.
