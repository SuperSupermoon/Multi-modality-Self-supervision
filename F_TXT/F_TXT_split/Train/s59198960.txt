AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. The patient remains intubated, the cannula remains in unchanged position. No pneumothorax has developed. Heart size remains normal and no pulmonary vascular congestion is present. There remains a mild elevation of the left diaphragm, apparently related to this gas-distended stomach and-or large bowel. The on previous examination suspected mild crowding of the pulmonary vasculature has not progressed and thus, there is no evidence of any new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate. No pneumothorax in the apical area.
