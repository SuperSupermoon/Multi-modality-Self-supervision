Slightly rotated positioning. Tubing overlies the extreme upper right lung apex. An ET tube is present. The tip lies approximately 2.0 cm above the carina. An OG type tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm, off film. The patient is status post sternotomy, with mediastinal clips. There is a moderately large left pleural effusion, which obscures the left heart border and left hemidiaphragm and which tracks along the left chest wall and into the left lung apex. The aortic knob is not well delineated, in part due to rotation, but also due to the left apical fluid. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains midline. On the right, there is possible minimal upper zone redistribution. Patchy opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle is noted. No frank consolidation is identified. No effusion. No pneumothorax is detected. No displaced rib fracture is identified.
