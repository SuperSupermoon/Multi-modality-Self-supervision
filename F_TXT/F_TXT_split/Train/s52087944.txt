As compared to previous radiograph, the findings suggestive of pulmonary edema have mildly increased in severity, as reflected by increasing radiodensity and ___ of vascular structures, notably in the upper lung zones. Moreover, the lung volumes have decreased and a small left pleural effusion is likely to have developed. The right Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position.
