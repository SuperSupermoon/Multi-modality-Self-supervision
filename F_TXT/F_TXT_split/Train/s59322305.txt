Lung volumes are low, exaggerating the cardiac silhouettes and pulmonary vasculature with associated bibasilar atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged with postoperative mediastinum and mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. There is central pulmonary vascular congestion with cephalization but without frank interstitial edema and is improved compared to earlier exam. Lungs are otherwise clear. Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax. A right dual-lead pacer is in standard position.
