No comparison. Lung volumes are normal. Normal alignment of the sternal wires of the CABG. Mild cardiomegaly with elongation of the descending aorta. Platelike atelectasis at the right lung bases but no evidence of pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
