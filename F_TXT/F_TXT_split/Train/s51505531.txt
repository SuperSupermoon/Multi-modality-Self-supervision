Patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. Heart size remains mildly enlarged, unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Lung volumes are low with mild crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly visualized. A right-sided PICC tip terminates in the low SVC.
