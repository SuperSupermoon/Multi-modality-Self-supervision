Comparison is made to prior study from ___. Study is somewhat limited due to the overlying board artifact. There is a left-sided chest tube whose tip is in the left lung apex. Tiny left apical pneumothorax is again seen. There are several rib fractures in the right upper chest. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position with the sideport of the OG tube at the GE junction. This again could be advanced several centimeters for more optimal placement. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
