Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided. There has been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter with its tip in the low SVC. Dense consolidation is again noted in the left lower lobe compatible with pneumonia. Mild consolidation at the right lung base is better assessed on the same-day chest CT. There is no pneumothorax. Effusion on the left is difficult to exclude. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures appear intact, though old right rib cage deformities are noted.
