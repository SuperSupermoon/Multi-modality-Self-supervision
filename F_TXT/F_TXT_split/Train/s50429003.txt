AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Pneumonia in the right lower lobe has been clearing slowly. Consolidation in the left lower lobe progressed dramatically from ___ through ___. The severe leftward mediastinal shift indicates that a good deal of that consolidation is collapse. Bronchial clearance is strongly suggested. Small pleural effusion is presumed. There is no pneumothorax. NG tube in standard placement. Right jugular line ends low in the SVC. ___ was paged at 11 a.m. when the findings were recognized, and I discussed the findings by telephone with the physician who answered on her behalf.
