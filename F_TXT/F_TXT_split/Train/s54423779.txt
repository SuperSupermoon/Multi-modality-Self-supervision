AP view of the chest. There is increased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax some of which is pleural-based and compatible with known pleural metastases. Postoperative changes in the right suprahilar region are again seen. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle potentially due to pleural mets versus underlying effusion, not significantly changed. On the left, there is persistent opacity projecting over the left 1st rib compatible with region of consolidation on prior CT. There is definite no definite new region of consolidation. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No acute osseous abnormality detected. Osseous metastases better seen on prior CT involving the right ribs.
