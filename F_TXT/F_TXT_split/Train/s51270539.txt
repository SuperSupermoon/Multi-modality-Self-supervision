Swan-Ganz catheter ends slightly more distally when compared to the prior study in the proximal right pulmonary artery. The endotracheal tube ends approximately 14 cm above the carina. Dobhoff tube courses to the stomach, although the tip is excluded from view. An additional NG tube ends within the stomach. A right-sided catheter sheath remains in place ending in the upper SVC. Multiple surgical clips are noted in the right axilla. A widened mediastinum is in keeping with patient's known chronic aortic dissection and recent mitral valve surgery. Aortic valve replacement is also present. Pulmonary edema has slightly worsened. Increasing opacity in the left lung likely represents asymmetric pulmonary edema given appearance of recent prior studies. There is no pneumothorax.
