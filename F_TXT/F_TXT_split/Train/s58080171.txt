Large areas of consolidation have developed in the upper lungs, either posterior segments of the upper lobes or superior segments of the lower lobes. Consolidation present earlier in the right lower lobe has increased. Heart size is normal and mediastinal vessels have not dilated, so the findings are probably due to worsening pneumonia, particularly aspiration rather than pulmonary edema. Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC. Small pleural effusions are present. There is no pneumothorax.
