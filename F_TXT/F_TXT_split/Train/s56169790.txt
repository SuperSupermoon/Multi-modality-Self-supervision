There is increased opacification over the right lung, likely due to increase in loculated pleural effusion, underlying atelectasis, with concern for worsening of metastatic disease, underlying consolidation or infection not excluded. Increased opacification of the right upper lobe may represent increased tumor spread although infection is not excluded. The patient is rotated to the right, however, library deviation of the trachea suggest partial lung collapse, likely obstruction from tumor. Increasing nodular opacities diffusely throughout the lower left lung is highly concerning for progression of metastatic disease. A small left pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. Diffuse osseous metastases better evaluated on CT.
