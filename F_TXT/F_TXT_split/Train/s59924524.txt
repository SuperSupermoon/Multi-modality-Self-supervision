There has been interval removal of the left pigtail catheter and placement of two left-sided chest tubes. Overall, aeration of the left lung base appears slightly improved as compared to recent prior examination, though there is still persistent left basilar consolidation and effusion. No post-procedural pneumothorax is identified. Stable increased density of the right lung base is likely a combination of atelectasis and a small effusion. There is no new pulmonary edema. Visualized mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited on this examination secondary to bibasilar opacities.
