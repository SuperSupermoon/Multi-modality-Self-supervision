Frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained. A new pericardial drain overlies the heart. The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged due to known underlying large pericardial effusion but the apparent left ventricular border is less rounded than on ___, compatible with a slight interval decrease in pericardial effusion. The azygous vein is also substantially smaller. 7.6-cm mass projecting over the right hilum represents the patient's known large anterior mediastinal mass. The indistinct left costophrenic angle is compatible with a small pleural effusion, which was present on ___. No pneumothorax.
