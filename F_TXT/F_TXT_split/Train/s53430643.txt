As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 3 cm above the carina. The course and the tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter is unremarkable, but the catheter should be pulled back by approximately 2 cm, as the tip projects over the rather distal parts of the right pulmonary artery. Moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged, moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly. No pleural effusions.
