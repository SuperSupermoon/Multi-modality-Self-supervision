1. The heart remains stably enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion should also be considered. A left-sided pacer remains in place. There has been interval development of a bilateral diffuse airspace and interstitial process most likely representing a moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. A diffuse infectious process would be less likely. No large effusions are appreciated. No evidence of pneumothorax. Calcification of the aortic knob consistent with atherosclerosis. Focal opacity in the right upper lobe may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
