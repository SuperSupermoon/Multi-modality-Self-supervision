Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present. Heterogeneous opacities in the right mid and lower lung region have slightly worsened since the prior study, and an adjacent moderate, partially loculated right pleural effusion has also increased in size. These findings are concerning for recurrent or progressive infection, and CT should be considered for further characterization given lack of demonstration of clearing since the prior radiograph. Small left pleural effusion and adjacent left basilar atelectasis are new.
