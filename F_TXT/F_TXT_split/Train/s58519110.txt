Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. The left internal jugular central line terminates in the proximal SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There continues to be a diffuse interstitial abnormality with some superimposed patchy opacities at both bases. There is relative sparing in the right upper lobe. Overall, the imaging appearance is not significantly changed dating back to ___. However, in the absence of more remote imaging, it is difficult to determine whether this represents pre-existing chronic interstitial lung disease and/or emphysematous changes or whether this is a more acute process superimposed on a chronic interstitial lung disease. Clinical correlation is therefore advised and comparison to outside imaging would be extremely helpful. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax.
