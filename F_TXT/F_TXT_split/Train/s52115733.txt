In comparison with the preoperative study, there is now a left chest tube in place without definite pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette appears substantially more prominent, beyond that expected by the portable image. There is also indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Increased opacification at the right base could reflect some pleural effusion and atelectasis. Less prominent opacification is seen at the left base. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. There is also some hazy opacification around the mass in the left perihilar region. Some of this could represent post-procedure hemorrhage.
