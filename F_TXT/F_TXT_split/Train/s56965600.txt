The right subclavian PICC line is in place and has its tip in the mid SVC. Lung volumes remain low with a small stable layering left effusion. Patchy opacities at both bases, left greater than right, are again seen and may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
