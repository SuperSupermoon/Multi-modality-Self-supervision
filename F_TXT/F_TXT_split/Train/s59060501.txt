Interval placement of a right-sided internal jugular central venous line, with the tip terminating in the mid SVC. Extensive bibasilar opacities are again noted with associated cystic abnormalities, correlating with the patient's known severe bronchiectasis and mucous impaction. Superimposed consolidation in the right mid and lower lung have progressed in the interval, with associated worsening peribronchial cuffing in the right perihilar region. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
