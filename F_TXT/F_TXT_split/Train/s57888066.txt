CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 17:12 p.m., the ET and NG tubes have been removed. The right and left chest tubes, the metallic structure over the left chest, and the right IJ line are unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, but with slight interval improvement indicated by new visualization of the left hemidiaphragm. There is focal patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, slightly worse. The CHF findings are similar.
