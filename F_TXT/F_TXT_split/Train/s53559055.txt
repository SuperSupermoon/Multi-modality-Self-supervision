Compared to the study from the prior day, there has been some interval partial clearing of the upper lobes but a worsening appearance of the lower lobes with more dense consolidation of both lower lobes. It is unclear if this is fluid overload or infectious infiltrate. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian line are unchanged.
