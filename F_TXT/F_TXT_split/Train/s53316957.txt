The endotracheal tube ends 3.7 cm above the level of the carina. A right pleural catheter ends at the right lung apex, not significantly changed. An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm with its side port just below the level of the gastroesophageal junction. A severe interstitial abnormality may be minimally improved compared to the prior radiograph from earlier today. Focal lucency at the medial right lung base is slightly less conspicuous on the present study, possibly a small pneumothorax or extrapleural gas collection. Marked subcutaneous air has decreased on the left, but is not significantly changed on the right. The heart size remains normal.
