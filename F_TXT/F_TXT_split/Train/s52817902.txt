A right Port-A-Cath is seen terminating at the cavoatrial junction. The lung volumes are low. There is minimal vascular congestion. There is an opacity at the base of the right lung, which partially obscures the right heart border, worse on than on the prior, and is concerning for a pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged. The pleural surfaces are normal without effusion or pneumothorax. Thoracolumbar fusion rods are intact and unchanged.
