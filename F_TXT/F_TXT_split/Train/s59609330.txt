Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings at the lung bases. Given this, no focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
