AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR STUDY THERE IS NO CHANGE IN THE CARDIOMEDIASTINAL SILHOUETTE AND ELEVATED RIGHT HEMIDIAPHRAGM. THERE IS SLIGHTLY MORE INCREASED OPACITY IN THE LEFT PERIHILAR AREA, MOST LIKELY RELATED TO SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITION TO THE PATIENT AND LUNG LIKELY TO REPRESENT INTERVAL DEVELOPMENT OF INFECTIOUS PROCESS. ATTENTION TO THIS AREA ON THE SUBSEQUENT STUDY IS RECOMMENDED.
