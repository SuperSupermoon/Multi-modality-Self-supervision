One portable upright view of the chest. The right internal jugular central venous catheter is stable. An ET tube ends 4.4 cm from the carina. NG tube traverses the esophagus and tip is below the level of this film. Compared to most recent study, there are new, mostly central and bibasilar opacities. A new right lower lobe heterogeneous opacity likely represents pulmonary edema; however, pneumonia cannot be ruled out. No pneumothorax. New small left pleural effusion.
