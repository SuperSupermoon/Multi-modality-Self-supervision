A single portable frontal view of the chest shows no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. Apparent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is secondary to positioning. The cardiac silhouette is mild to moderately enlarged but unchanged. Dense calcifications are seen within the mitral anulus. The mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable.
