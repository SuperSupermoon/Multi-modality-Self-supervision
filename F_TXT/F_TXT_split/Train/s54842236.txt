AP chest compared to ___, 4:41 a.m. read in conjunction with torso CT, ___, 1:30 p.m.: Small amount of air projects over the medial aspect of the left lung and mediastinum at the level of main pulmonary artery. This could be a tiny pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Neither was present on the torso CT, ___, which showed a very small anterior right pneumothorax, which one would not expect to see on conventional chest radiograph, particularly unless obtained with the patient sitting erect. There is no appreciable right pneumothorax or pleural effusion on either side. Caliber of the mediastinum reflects venous engorgement and non-erect positioning. ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach, with its most proximal side port just at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. Lungs are essentially clear. The new finding of tiny left pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can be monitored with conventional radiographs. Findings were discussed with Dr. ___, by telephone, two minutes after recognition of radiographic abnormality.
