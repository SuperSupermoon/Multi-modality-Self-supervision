Rotated positioning. There is cardiomegaly, unchanged. Air overlying the right inferior cardiac silhouette relates to a very large pulmonary bulla seen on the ___ CT scan. Lobulated calcified densities at the lung apices are again noted, unchanged. An additional nodular density is seen in the right upper zone, partially obscured by the EKG lead on today's study. Otherwise, doubt focal consolidation, overt CHF, or gross effusion. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle cannot be excluded. Old, healed right-sided rib fractures are present. 2 NG type catheters appear to be present. 1 has a radiopaque tip that overlies the lower esophagus and adjoining gastric fundus. The other overlies the distal esophagus.
