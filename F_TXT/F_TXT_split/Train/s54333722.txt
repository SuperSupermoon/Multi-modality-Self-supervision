ET tube tip lies above the level of the clavicles, relatively high. NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm off the film. The tube tip seen in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen likely represents the tip of the looped NG tube, but should be correlated clinically. Left subclavian central line tip overlies the middle/distal SVC. Bilateral pigtail-type catheters are seen at both lung bases. The patient is rotated, but note is made of a small left apical pneumothorax, improved compared with ___. No obvious right apical pneumothorax, though the film is labeled as supine. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, which has increased slightly compared with the prior film. A hazy opacity in the right upper zone has improved. Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear. No CHF. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The patient's right midclavicular fracture is again noted. There are multiple known lower cervical/upper thoracic spine fractures, which are not well depicted on this examination.
