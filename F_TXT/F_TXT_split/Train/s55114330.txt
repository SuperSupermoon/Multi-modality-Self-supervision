There are low inspiratory volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is increased opacity at the left base, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, possibly slightly worse. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, progressed from the prior film. The right lung base in costophrenic sulcus are grossly clear, except for subsegmental atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen are the rib fractures along the left upper chest wall. There is a small amount of newly visible pleural thickening in this area, consistent with edema/hemorrhage.
