Left lower lobe is airless, and the mediastinum shifted mildly to the left. This indicates a large component of atelectasis, although pneumonia is not excluded. Left pleural effusion is small. A small region of peribronchial opacification in the right lower lobe could be due to aspiration or early pneumonia. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax.
