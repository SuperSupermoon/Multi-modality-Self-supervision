As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, reflecting either improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressure. No new focal parenchymal opacity is noted, but the preexisting bilateral and relatively diffuse opacities are constant in appearance. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
