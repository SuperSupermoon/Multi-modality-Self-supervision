Single supine view of the chest. Linear left basilar opacity is likely due to atelectasis. Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. There is no evidence of a large pneumothorax based on the supine film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No displaced fractures identified based on this non-dedicated exams. Median sternotomy wires are again noted as well as an aortic valve replacement. Deviation of the trachea to the right at the thoracic inlet is compatible with left-sided thyroid enlargement as seen on prior CT chest.
