Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Currently lung volumes are low with bibasal opacities present, left more than right, potentially reflecting progression of already demonstrated basal opacities that on the left can potentially reflect pulmonary infarct due to pulmonary embolism demonstrated on prior CT. No new consolidation to suggest interval progression of pneumonia demonstrated, although it cannot be entirely excluded.
