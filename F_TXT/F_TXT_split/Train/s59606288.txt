A new left internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid superior vena cava. The patient remains intubated with an orogastric tube that courses into the stomach. The patient is status post coronary bypass graft surgery. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Since the prior study, opacification of the left lung base has increased but appears similar to slightly decreased at the right lung base. This appearance suggests atelectasis and possibly an increasing pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
