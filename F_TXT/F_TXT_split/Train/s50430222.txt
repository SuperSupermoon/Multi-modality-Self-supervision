Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina. Heart size and mediastinum appear to be enlarged as compared to prior study in this patient with rapid development of bilateral parenchymal opacities most likely consistent with pulmonary edema, substantial. Right pleural effusion is small to moderate, unchanged. Bilateral enlargement of pulmonary arteries is re-demonstrated. The NG tube has been inserted with its tip too proximal, terminating at the level of mid esophagus and should be further advanced.
