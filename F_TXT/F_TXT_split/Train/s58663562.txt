ET tube, NG tube and right pleural tube are in unchanged satisfactory position. Worsening heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lung are likely related to worsening pneumonia and enlarging pleural effusion. Left pleural effusion also larger since yesterday. Pulmonary vascular congestion in the bilateral upper lungs worse since yesterday. No change in cardiomediastinal silhouette. No pneumothorax.
