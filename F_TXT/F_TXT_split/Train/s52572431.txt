An orogastric tube is present. The radiopaque tip overlies the expected location of the GE junction and perhaps also the uppermost fundus, but has not passed completely beyond the GE junction. Again seen is a left subclavian PICC line with tip over distal SVC. Also again seen is a small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation as well as vascular plethora and blurring consistent with CHF. Patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is unchanged. Faint more confluent opacity in the right mid zone is new. The right costophrenic angles excluded from the film.
