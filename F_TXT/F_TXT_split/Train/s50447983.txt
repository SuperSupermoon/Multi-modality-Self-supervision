The right subclavian central line is unchanged position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. A few streaky linear opacities at both bases most likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. A curvilinear line in the left upper lung is felt to be related to clothing or sheets as it does appear matched pulmonary markings extend beyond the line making pneumothorax unlikely. Followup imaging, however, would be advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large effusions.
