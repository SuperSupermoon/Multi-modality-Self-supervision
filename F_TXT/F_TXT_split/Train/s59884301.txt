AP chest compared to ___ 3:04 p.m. Right middle and lower lobe collapse have worsened. Right upper lobe is clear. Peribronchial opacification at the left lung base could be due to aspiration. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach and should be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction. Left pleural drain still in place. No appreciable left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Some right pleural effusion is presumed, but not as significant as the atelectasis. I discussed these findings by telephone with the house officer caring for this patient at 10:00AM after a page at 9:50 a.m. as soon as the findings were recognized.
