The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal. There is no mediastinal widening. The lungs are clear. No pleural effusions. A rod overlies the right lateral ribs and the rib fractures seen on concurrent CT torso of T5 through T9 are not visible. There is a small amount of subcutaneous air in the right lateral soft tissues, likely from small right pneumothorax seen on CT torso. The small pneumothorax is not seen on this radiograph however probably due to overlying rod. No focal parenchymal opacities.
