AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. The lung volumes are somewhat low. There is subtle poorly defined opacity at the left lung base, which could represent a very early pneumonia. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Two surgical clips project over the right lung apex. The heart and mediastinal contour appears normal. Bony structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
