As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes are slightly increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressure. The endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis. Signs of mild pulmonary edema remain present.
