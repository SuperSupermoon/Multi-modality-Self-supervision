The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased. There is blunting at the left costophrenic angle with hazy opacity at the left lung base, likely reflecting a combination pleural effusion and associated atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical context. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
