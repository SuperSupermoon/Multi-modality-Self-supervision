Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen. Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is again seen with adjacent pleural and parenchymal scarring at the right base. Surgical clips are present in both lungs consistent with prior wedge resection procedures.
