The requisition states check ETT position. There is no ETT visualized but there appears to be a tracheostomy tube and the tip is 3 cm above the carina. The upper midchest is obscured by the patient's head and ventilatory equipment. This limits evaluation for pneumothorax. There is cardiomegaly but no CHF. There are faint patchy nodular densities in the left mid chest and this should be re-evaluated with a PA and lateral film when the patient is stable. It is possible that this represents superimposition of normal structures.
