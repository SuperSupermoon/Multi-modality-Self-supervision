Study is slightly limited due to motion within the right lung base. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present however the left costophrenic angle is not included in the field of view. Prominent air-filled loops of bowel are seen within the upper abdomen.
