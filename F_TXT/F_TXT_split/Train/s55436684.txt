Compared one day earlier and allowing for differences in technique, there has been possible slight interval improvement at the right and left lung bases, with suggestion of increased lucency at both lung bases. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Note is made of a tapered, well corticated appearance to the right distal clavicle --___ there history of prior surgery to account for this?
