Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiac size is top normal. Widened mediastinum is persistent and is a combination of elongated neck vessels and elongated ascending aorta. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy cannot be totally excluded. Left lower lobe opacities have increased in density, consistent with worsening pneumonia. Faint opacities in the right mid lung are stable. This could be due to aspiration. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
