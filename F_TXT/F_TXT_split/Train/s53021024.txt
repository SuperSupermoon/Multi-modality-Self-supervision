Combination of moderate right pleural effusion and right basal consolidation has not changed. Left lower lobe atelectasis is more pronounced. Upper lungs are clear of consolidation but show pulmonary vascular engorgement. Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured, still moderately enlarged. No pneumothorax. ET tube and left subclavian central venous line are in standard placements and a nasogastric drainage tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
