Endotracheal tube terminates 4.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach. There is a right IJ central line as well as a left subclavian central line, both of which extend to the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. There are bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right. This likely accounts for worsened basilar opacities. Additional ill-defined perihilar opacities are suggestive of slight progressive worsening of pulmonary edema. Heart size is progressively enlarged compared to prior studies. Retrocardiac opacity at the left base is most compatible with significant volume loss.
