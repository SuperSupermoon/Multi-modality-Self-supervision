A portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates mildly low lung volumes, with exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Even allowing for this, heart size is likely mildly enlarged. Diffuse opacity is likely due to moderate pulmonary edema. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
