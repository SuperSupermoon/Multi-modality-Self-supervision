Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There has been interval increase in the size of the right pleural effusion, which is now small, and there is adjacent atelectasis. There is a tiny left-sided pleural effusion with some adjacent atelectasis as well. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are overall unchanged. Again seen is a left pectoral pacemaker with leads in the expected location.
