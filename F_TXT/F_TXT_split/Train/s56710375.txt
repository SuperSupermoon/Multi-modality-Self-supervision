No previous images. The endotracheal tube lies only about 8 mm above the carina and is just above the orifice of the right main stem bronchus. This should be pulled back. Respiratory motion somewhat degrades the image. Nevertheless, there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Low endotracheal tube position was detected at 8:53 a.m. on ___ and telephoned to Dr. ___ at 8:55.
