AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Tracheostomy cannula in place as before, unchanged appearance of previously described right internal jugular approach central venous line terminating in mid portion of SVC. Small heart size, no pulmonary vascular congestive pattern. Advanced bilateral hyperinflation indicative of COPD and emphysema remains unchanged with mildly blunted lateral pleural sinuses and low positioned flattened diaphragms. The portable single view chest examination does not reveal any new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate that would match the recent observed new leukocytosis. No pneumothorax is present.
