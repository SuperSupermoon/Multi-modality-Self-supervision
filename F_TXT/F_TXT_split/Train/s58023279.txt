Endotracheal tube tip terminates in standard position approximately 5.6 cm from the carina. The nasogastric tube tip courses below the diaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film, likely within the stomach. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is continued mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar airspace opacities. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is evident although the extreme left costophrenic angle is not fully included in the field of view.
