Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.4 cm above the level of the carina which has advanced approximately 1 cm since the prior study. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm into the left upper quadrant inferior aspect not included on the image. External artifact projects over the right lung apex making this area difficult to assess. Elsewhere, there is no focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
