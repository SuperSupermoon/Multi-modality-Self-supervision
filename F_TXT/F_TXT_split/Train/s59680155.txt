An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, approximately 8 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. A right central venous catheter is unchanged with the tip in the low SVC. A right mid and lower lung zone opacity is not significantly changed from the prior exam, and likely reflects a combination of the known pneumonia and a right pleural effusion. A retrocardiac opacity is also not significantly changed, likely due to atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion. The apices of the lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Flowing osteophytes are noted in the thoracic spine.
