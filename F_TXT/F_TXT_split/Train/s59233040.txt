As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased. As a consequence, the radiodensity of the pre-existing bilateral apical parenchymal opacities, associated with volume loss, have decreased in extent and severity. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions. Unchanged position of the right central venous access line.
