AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in relatively high position, terminating some 6 cm above the level of the carina. This position is absolutely unchanged in comparison with the previous study. Also, the NG tube remains and reaches well below the diaphragm. Heart size is probably slightly enlarged, but no evidence of pleural effusion or advanced congestive pulmonary vascular pattern. Similar as on the previous portable chest examination, there are some scattered patchy parenchymal densities, mostly on the right lower base but also in the right upper lobe area, suggestive of some inflammatory processes. There is no progression in comparison with yesterday's study, rather slightly regression is noted. No pneumothorax is seen.
