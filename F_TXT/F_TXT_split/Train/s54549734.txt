1. Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Interval extubation. Interval removal of the left internal jugular central line and nasogastric tube. There is left pleural effusion with some patchy associated airspace disease, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. There is slightly prominent interstitium in the periphery of the right lung as well as a suggestion of some bronchial cuffing. These findings likely reflect mild interstitial edema. No pneumothorax.
