Severe airspace consolidation is present in the mid and lower lungs bilaterally, and accompanied by moderate pleural effusions. Heart size is difficult to assess due to partial obscuration of part borders by the airspace disease. Observed findings may be due to clinical history of multifocal pneumonia, and also raise the possibility of ARDS in the appropriate clinical setting.
