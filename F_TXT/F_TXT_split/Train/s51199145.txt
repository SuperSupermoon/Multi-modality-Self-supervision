Supine frontal radiograph of the chest was reviewed. There is an ET tube with tip terminating in the right mainstem bronchus. An enteric tube is seen coursing towards the stomach with distal tip off the film. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Median sternotomy wires and CABG markers are noted. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is moderate pulmonary edema. Increased opacification of the right upper lobe may reflect aspiration.
