As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting increased ventilatory pressures. All monitoring and support devices, including the large bore central venous device on the right, are in unchanged position. The areas of consolidation, located in the right upper lobe as well as the left lung base, and the focal parenchymal opacities at the right lung bases and the left perihilar areas are unchanged in extent and severity. No new parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
