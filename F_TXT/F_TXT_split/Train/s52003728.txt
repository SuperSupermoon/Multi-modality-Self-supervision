There is now a moderate left basilar pneumothorax status post Pleurx tube placement within the left basilar pleural space. There has been a decrease in the size of the left pleural effusion which appears small in size. Left mid lung field opacification may represent some loculation of the pleural fluid with atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded. Nodular lobulations are noted within the left basilar pleura and along the left cardiac border. Patchy opacities at the right lung base continue to reflect atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, wihtout significant shift of mediastinal structures.
