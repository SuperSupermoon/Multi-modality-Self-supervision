AP chest compared to ___ and ___: Once again, lung volumes are quite low, presumably due to abdominal organomegaly, and there is substantial right basal atelectasis. Small right pleural effusion may also be present, but unchanged. Mild interstitial abnormality in the left lung suggests borderline edema, but the heart is not enlarged, and there is no particular pulmonary vascular engorgement or left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
