The inspiratory lung volumes remain low with an unchanged large hernia containing bowel in the left hemi thorax. Right middle lobe atelectasis is slightly improved from the most recent prior study. No other focal consolidations are noted. There is no increase in size of a small right pleural effusion. There is no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is present. The cardio mediastinal silhouette is incompletely evaluated but likely within normal limits and unchanged. Again there is a large hiatal hernia with mildly distended contents but unchanged.
