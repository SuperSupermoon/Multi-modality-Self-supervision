Bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with no visible pneumothorax. Indwelling support and monitoring devices are similar in position with endotracheal tube terminating about 2.4 cm above the carina. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Bibasilar atelectasis is again demonstrated, slightly worse on the right, but improving on the left. Small pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
