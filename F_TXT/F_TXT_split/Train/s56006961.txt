Patient is status post AVR. There is prior evidence of median sternotomy and the sternal sutures are intact. Since prior radiograph from yesterday, the left chest tube has been removed. There is very minimal pneumothorax distributed at left costophrenic angle. Mild pneumomediastinum is unchanged since yesterday. Small right pleural effusion and right basal atelectasis have improved, whereas left lower lung atelectasis reflected by increased retrocardiac density has worsened. Pulmonary vascular congestion is much better than what it was on yesterday's radiograph. Swan-Ganz catheter through the right internal jugular approach is seen; however, the tip is now more proximally migrated and appears either in the ventricular outflow tract or in the right ventricle. Consider repositioning.
