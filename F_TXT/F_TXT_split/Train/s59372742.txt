The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for age and technique and remains midline. There is atelectasis in the right upper zone, with several bandlike opacities. The right hemidiaphragm is probably slightly elevated. There is atelectasis at both lung bases. More hazy opacity at right base may reflect the presence of a small effusion. Mild vascular plethora is noted, consistent with mild CHF. A left chest tube is present. No pneumothorax is detected.
