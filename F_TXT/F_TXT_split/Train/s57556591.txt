Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by worsening asymmetrically distributed alveolar opacities, most confluent in the left perihilar and basilar retrocardiac areas. Additionally, poorly defined nodular opacities are present, particularly in the right upper, left mid and left lower lung regions. The observed findings likely represent a multifocal infectious process coexisting with pulmonary edema. Given the nodular appearance of the lung lesions, invasive fungal infection should be considered if the patient is neutropenic. Additionally, there is an enlarging moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
