Right pleural drainage catheter is in place. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. A small right pleural effusion is smaller compared to prior study. Asymmetric pulmonary edema, worse on the right is not changed. A moderate left pleural effusion is slighter larger. The known left upper lobe mass with postobstructive left upper lobe collapse is re- demonstrated without significant change. No pneumothorax.
