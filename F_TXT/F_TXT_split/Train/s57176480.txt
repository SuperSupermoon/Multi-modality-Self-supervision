As compared to the previous radiograph, a large left tension pneumothorax has developed of the pleural puncture. A chest tube on the left is in situ. The tip of the tube is likely too medial and should be pulled back by approximately 3-4 cm. No change in appearance of the right lung and of the cardiac silhouette.
