There has been placement of a tracheal tube just above the level of the clavicles. The tip is not well seen. There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. There is linear atelectasis at the left lung base with a small left-sided pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.
