ET tube tip is low, 1.7 cm above the carina and should be pulled back at least 1.5-2 cm. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of lower SVC. Cardial mediastinal silhouette is stable, overall unremarkable. There is interval improvement in pulmonary edema which is still persistent with associated increased in the interim pleural effusion most likely reflecting the clearance of pulmonary edema. The effusions are at least moderate and bilateral. Left retrocardiac consolidation might reflect atelectasis due to increasing pleural effusion but infection this area cannot be excluded.
