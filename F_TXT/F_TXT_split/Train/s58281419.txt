As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, bilateral alveolar and interstitial opacities appear worsened, however this represents a limited evaluation given change in obliquity and patient's positioning.

Left hemidiaphragm is not completely visualized, this could be related to increased pleural fluid or due to oblique positioning.
