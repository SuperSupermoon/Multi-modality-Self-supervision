In the right lung, there are patchy opacities, better appreciated on CT from the same day, consistent with an infectious process. Left lung is essentially clear on this radiograph with the exception of streaky atelectasis at the base. Large hiatal hernia seen in the left hemithorax, again better appreciated on the CT from the same day. ET tube terminates 5 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen in the esophagus; however, it does not appear to reach the stomach on this radiograph or on the CT from the same day.
