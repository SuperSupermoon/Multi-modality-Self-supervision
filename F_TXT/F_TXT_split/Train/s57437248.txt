Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right atrium. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The aorta remains mildly tortuous. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present. The pulmonary arteries remain mildly prominent lymph bilaterally. There are small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar patchy opacities, potentially atelectasis though aspiration is not excluded. The lung apices are not well seen, obscured by the patient's neck and chin. No large pneumothorax is present. Multiple acutely displaced right-sided rib fractures are seen.
