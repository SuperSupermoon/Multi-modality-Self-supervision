Three fiducial seeds have been placed in the right hemithorax, one medial to the right hilum, one lateral to the right hilum, and a third at the right apex. A poorly defined opacity lateral to the right hilum probably represents the patient's known superior segment right lower lobe lung nodule with surrounding post-procedural hemorrhage. Approximately 1 cm diameter right apical lung nodule adjacent to the third fiducial seed is also noted and has been more fully characterized by CT. Other smaller lung nodules are much better demonstrated on CT. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Subcutaneous emphysema is present in the right apex.
