The absence of leftward mediastinal shift suggests that the pleural effusion is not acute, and is matched by an equivalent loss of volume in the collapsed right middle and lower lobes. Heart size is indeterminate since the right heart border is obscured. Left lung is grossly clear and there is no appreciable left pleural effusion.
