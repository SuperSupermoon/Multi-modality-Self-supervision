There has been placement of a nasogastric tube whose side port is just beyond the GE junction. There is an unchanged right-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, stable. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. A left retrocardiac opacity is again seen and stable. There are no pneumothoraces.
