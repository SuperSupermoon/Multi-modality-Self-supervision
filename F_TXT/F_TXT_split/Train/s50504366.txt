There is diffuse bilateral but heterogeneous opacification of each lung of moderate density. This appearance could be seen with widespread pneumonia or pulmonary edema, among other causes including impeding respiratory distress syndrome, aspiration or hemorrhage. Correlation with clinical circumstances is recommended as well as short-term follow-up radiographs. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
