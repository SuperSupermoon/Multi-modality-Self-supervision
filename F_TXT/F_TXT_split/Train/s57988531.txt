There has been interval increase in opacity projecting over the right hemi thorax, particularly involving the right mid to lower lung. Findings may be due to large pneumonia and volume loss, worsening of malignant disease, with possible component of radiation. Slight tenting of of the right hemidiaphragm suggests an element of volume loss. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. Evidence of COPD is re- demonstrated. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous.
