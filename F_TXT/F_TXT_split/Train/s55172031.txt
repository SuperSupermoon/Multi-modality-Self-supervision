No priors available for comparison. The patient is rotated to the left. There is near complete opacification of the left hemithorax, with shift of the mediastinum into the left hemithorax. A surgical clip is seen in the left upper lung. The right lung is clear, with no focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is difficult to assess given mediastinal shift.
