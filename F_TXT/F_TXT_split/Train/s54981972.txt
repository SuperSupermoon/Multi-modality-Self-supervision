Severe worsening infiltrative pulmonary abnormality most pronounced in the right upper lobe. Heart size is normal but increased since ___ mediastinal veins are engorged. There is presumably a component of pulmonary edema, but unless the patient has mitral regurgitation to explain the predominant edema in the right upper lobe, that abnormality is more likely due to concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. An alternative explanation for the interstitial abnormality attributed to cardiogenic edema would be transfusion or drug reaction. Small right pleural effusion has increased.
