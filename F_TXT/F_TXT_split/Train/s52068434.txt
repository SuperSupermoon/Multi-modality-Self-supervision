Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The left chest tube appears to be re-adjusted with the tip being projecting superiorly as compared to the prior examination. The widespread parenchymal consolidations and bilateral pleural effusion appear to be unchanged. There is evidence of left apical pneumothorax, small, better appreciated on the current radiograph as compared to prior examination.
