As compared to the previous radiograph, the parenchymal opacities in the lung, that were present at both the left and the right hemithorax, have slightly decreased in extent and severity. The left costophrenic sinus still shows minimal blunting, suggesting a remnant pleural effusion. On the right, no effusion is seen. Unchanged monitoring and support devices, unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
