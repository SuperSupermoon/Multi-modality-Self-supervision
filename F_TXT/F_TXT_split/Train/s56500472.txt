As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. Also removed is the Swan-Ganz catheter. The venous introduction sheet in the right internal jugular vein is in unchanged position. Finally, the mediastinal drains have been removed but the bilateral chest tubes are still in situ. The lung volumes have decreased and areas of atelectasis have newly occurred at both lung bases. However, no substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized. The alignment of the sternal wires is constant.
