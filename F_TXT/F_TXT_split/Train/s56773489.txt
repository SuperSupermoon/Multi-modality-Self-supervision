Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There is mild cardiomegaly. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. There is mild vascular congestion. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. Bibasilar atelectases are larger in the left side.
