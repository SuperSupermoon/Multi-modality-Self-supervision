As compared to the previous image, the previously placed right internal jugular vein catheter has been removed. New double-lumen catheter has been inserted. The tip of the catheter projects over the thoracic inlet at the level of the posterior aspect of the second rib. The tip is currently not securely positioned in the superior vena cava. The position of the endotracheal tube, the right PICC line and the nasogastric tube are unchanged. The patient develops slightly increasing right lower lobe atelectasis. The left lower lobe atelectasis and the bilateral areas of parenchymal opacities, reflecting moderate pulmonary edema, are constant. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
