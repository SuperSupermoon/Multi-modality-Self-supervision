Single AP frontal view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating in the low SVC/cavoatrial junction without evidence of pneumothorax. The lung fields appear similar as compared to the prior study with postoperative changes in this patient status post right upper lobectomy, right basilar scarring and evidence of left upper lobe collapse. Opacity projecting over the left lower hemithorax may relate to left upper lobe collapse, although underlying consolidation is not excluded.
