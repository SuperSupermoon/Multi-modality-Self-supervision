Single AP portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates a patient rotated toward his left. Low lung volumes are seen. Sternotomy wires are intact. Patient is status post valvular repair. The heart is stably enlarged. Bilateral opacification diaphragms may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. Obscuration of bilateral costophrenic angles likely reflects pulmonary effusions. Unchanged since most recent study, there are patchy parenchymal opacities bilaterally. In a patient with known heart failure, this likely reflects pulmonary edema.
