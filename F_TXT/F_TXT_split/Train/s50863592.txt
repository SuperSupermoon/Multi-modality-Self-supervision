Following right-sided thoracentesis, a right pleural effusion has substantially decreased in size with a residual moderate-to-large effusion remaining. The right lower lobe demonstrates improved aeration, but there is persistent atelectasis involving the right middle and right lower lobes. On the left, a small-to-moderate pleural effusion is probably unchanged, although difficult to compare due to projectional differences. There is no evidence of pneumothorax following thoracentesis.
