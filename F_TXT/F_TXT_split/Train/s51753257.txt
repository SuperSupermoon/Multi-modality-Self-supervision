In comparison with the study of ___, the position of the nasogastric tube is extremely difficult to determine on the views presented. It appears this extends to the upper stomach, though the side hole cannot be identified. Repeat study using abdominal technique would be necessary if clinically warranted. Remainder of the study is essentially unchanged, though the endotracheal tube appears to have been removed and the left central catheter pulled back into the mid to lower portion of the SVC.
