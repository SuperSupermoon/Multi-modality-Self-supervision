Endotracheal tube has been placed, with tip terminating 2.3 cm above the carina. This could be withdrawn slightly for optimal positioning. Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures, limiting assessment of the cardiovascular status of the patient. Patchy opacity in the right perihilar region is new and may reflect atelectasis or aspiration. Minimal linear atelectasis has developed at the left base as well. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
