Endotracheal tube is in standard position with tip about 3.5 cm above the carina. Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. This limits assessment of the cardiovascular status of the patient. Patchy opacity in left perihilar and both retrocardiac regions is nonspecific and could reflect atelectasis, aspiration and less likely a developing pneumonia. Followup radiograph may be helpful in this regard.
