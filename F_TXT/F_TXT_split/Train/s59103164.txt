Single AP upright image of the chest was obtained, however, the patient is only partially upright. The lung volumes are low causing crowded bronchovascular bundles; otherwise the lung fields are clear bilaterally with no focal consolidation or pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There are no bony abnormalities. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal in size allowing for the technique.
