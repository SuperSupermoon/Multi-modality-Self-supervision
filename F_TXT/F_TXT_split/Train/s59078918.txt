As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient continues to be intubated. The nasogastric tube is unchanged. Unchanged position of the left internal jugular vein catheter. The parenchymal opacities at the right lung base are constant. On the left, the radiodensity of the lung parenchyma has increased, which could potentially be caused by rotation of the patient. There is no unequivocal evidence of pneumonia, but short term followup should be performed.
