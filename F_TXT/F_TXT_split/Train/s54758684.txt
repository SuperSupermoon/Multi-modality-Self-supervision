There is a small right-sided pneumothorax with a chest tube traversing medially and terminating along the right mediastinal border. The heart size is mildly enlarged. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Note is made of subcutaneous emphysema along the right lateral chest wall. Increased opacities at the mid right lung, is likely secondary to aspiration. No acute fracture is identified. The left lung aside from mild pulmonary vascular congestion is otherwise clear. There is no large pleural effusion.
