Tracheostomy tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. There is persistent collapse of the left lower lobe with an associated layering effusion. Pneumonia in this area cannot be excluded. A patchy opacity at the right medial lung base has developed and more likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of low volumes, although again pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. The heart remains stably enlarged.
