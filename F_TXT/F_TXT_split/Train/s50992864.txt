Calcified lymph nodes are again demonstrated within the mediastinum and hilar regions, most marked on the left, and accompanied by bilateral upper lobe volume loss and scarring. No superimposed new areas of consolidation are evident to suggest an acute pneumonia. Findings could be due to chronic sarcoidosis or the sequela of a previous granulomatous infection.
