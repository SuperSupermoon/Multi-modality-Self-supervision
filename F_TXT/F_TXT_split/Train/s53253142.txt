Compared with ___ at 19:36 p.m., there is slight worsening of opacity at the left base, with new obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm as well as continued increased retrocardiac density. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with small pleural effusion. There is also worsening opacity at the right base reflecting worsening right effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is upper zone redistribution. Doubt overt CHF.
