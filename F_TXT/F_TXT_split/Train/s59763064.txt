AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Large right lung and hilar mass explains elevation of the right lung base due either to an elevated and perhaps paralyzed hemidiaphragm, perhaps subpulmonic pleural effusion. Decubitus view might be helpful in distinguishing between these two possibilities. Left lung is well expanded, shows vascular redistribution expected with redirection of blood flow from the right lung. Heart size is top normal. Azygous region is full, but CT scanning showed this is due to right lower paratracheal adenopathy. Given the severity of central lung cancer, possibility of acute pulmonary embolus should be entertained.
