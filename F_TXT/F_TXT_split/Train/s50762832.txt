The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The heart size is normal in size. Prominence of the right hilum appears unchanged also since the earliest study available and may reflect mild prominence of the pulmonary arteries. Nipple shadows on each side are visualized and appear unchanged. The lungs are markedly hyperinflated and mid to upper lungs appear markedly lucent suggesting severe emphysema. Blunting of each costophrenic sulcus appears chronic and is probably due to scarring, although it is difficult to exclude trace effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
