Lung volumes are low. Linear density at the left lung base likely represents atelectasis or scarring. No definite consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema. Heart and mediastinal contours are stable. Right subclavian large bore central catheter terminating in the right atrium appears similarly positioned. Left PICC terminates in the upper superior vena cava, as before. Sternal wires appear intact. Mediastinal clips are noted. There is gaseous distention of the stomach, which is new compared to prior. Upper abdominal clips are noted, as seen previously.
