Since the radiograph obtained 3 days prior, there has been interval removal of an ET tube and nasogastric tube, the large hiatal hernia is more clearly seen, and there is worsening of homogeneous opacification at the inferior right hemithorax. This is probably due to a combination of a moderate right pleural effusion and atelectasis associated with the hiatal hernia. A small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis appear unchanged. No clear consolidation is identified. A left-sided PICC terminates within the upper SVC.
