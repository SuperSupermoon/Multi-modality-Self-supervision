Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged. Lungs are hyperinflated. Aside from minimal atelectasis in the lung bases, there is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No pulmonary vascular engorgement is present. Linear densities within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen are compatible with a fractured old inferior vena cava filter, as demonstrated on the prior CT.
