A left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged, aorta remains unfolded. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise stable. There is no pulmonary edema. Subsegmental atelectasis or scarring is seen within the left lung base. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Multilevel degenerative changes within the thoracic spine are again demonstrated.
