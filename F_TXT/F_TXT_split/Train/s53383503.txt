A right mid lung opacity corresponds to known consolidation within the basilar right upper lobe. Bibasilar consolidations with effusions is likely a combination of infection and longstanding pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position terminating 2.8 cm from the carina. Pacemaker generator and leads are in expected unchanged position. A right approach central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. Overall aeration of the lungs is similar compared to most recent prior radiograph.
