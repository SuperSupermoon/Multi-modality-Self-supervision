ETT in situ with the tip above the level of the medial clavicles 82 mm above the carina. Right-sided subclavian CVP in situ with the tip at the cavoatrial junction. No right-sided pneumothorax. There is discrepancy between the lung volumes. There is airspace opacification seen in the medial aspect of the right lower lobe with obscuration of the right diaphragmatic pleural surface. The left costophrenic sulcus appears fairly deep, but this has been stable since ___ and there was no basal pneumothorax seen on the abdominal CT done ___. Dense opacification of the left lower lobe has progressed, probably collapse. Pleural effusions are likely, but the volumes are hard to determine. The left costophrenic angle is incompletely imaged.
