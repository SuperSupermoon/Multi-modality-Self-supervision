Endotracheal tube has its tip 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen with its tip in the stomach. Lungs appear well inflated and clear. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are seen although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax on this supine film is somewhat diminished.
