Right-sided central venous catheter terminates in the mid the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. The proximal portion of the venous catheter appears possibly coiled upon itself, however, part of the catheter may be external to the patient, and may just be overlapping. There are relatively low lung volumes. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal, likely accentuated by AP, portable technique. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
