1. Interval intubation with an endotracheal tube approximately 5 cm above the carina. Subclavian central line with its tip in the mid superior vena cava. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube with the tip coursing below the diaphragm but not identified on the current study. 2. Bilateral layering effusions, right much greater than left. There are patchy bibasilar opacities, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax.
