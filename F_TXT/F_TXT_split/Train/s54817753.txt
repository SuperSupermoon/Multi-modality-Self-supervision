Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. Tubes and lines are in unchanged position, except for interval placement of the NG tube terminating in the stomach. Opacification of the right hemithorax appears to be unchanged including both consolidation and pleural effusion. Left upper lung is essentially clear and left basal consolidation is unchanged.
