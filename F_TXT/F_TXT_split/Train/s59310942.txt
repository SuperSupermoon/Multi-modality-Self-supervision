Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. There is a persistent moderate-sized loculated right pleural collection with adjacent atelectasis. There is stable left apical thickening with volume loss. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. A right-sided Port-A-Cath ends at the cavoatrial junction. A dual-chamber pacemaker is again seen over the left chest, with appropriate position of the leads in the right atrium and ventricle.
