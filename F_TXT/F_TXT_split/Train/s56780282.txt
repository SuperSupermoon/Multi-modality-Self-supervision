In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has been reintubated with the tip of the endotracheal tube approximately 7.7 cm above the carina. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with intact midline sternal wires. An continued pulmonary edema with probable bilateral effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases. In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. The left subclavian line has been pulled back somewhat so that the tip is in the region of the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein with the superior vena cava.
