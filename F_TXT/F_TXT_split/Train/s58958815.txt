The chest tube of right side is still in the same position, the right tube seems very slightly displaced downward compared to prior exam with the tip now projected on the upper border of the 6th rib although the apparent position change may be partly due to orientational artfact. The 2 small bilatral pneumothoraces are not visible anymore. The perihilar vascular markings are still increased suggesting vascular congestion,
