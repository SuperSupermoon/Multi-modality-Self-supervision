The lungs are well expanded and clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Prominence of the right hilus is only insinuated behind the mediastinal shadow due to a slight rotation of the patient's position but is unchanged from the prior examination. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
