The endotracheal tube is 4.1 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular catheter courses to the level of the mid SVC. Enteric tube overlies the stomach, however, the tip was not imaged. The lung volumes remain low. Diffuse prominence of markings is indeterminate on this supine film. Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged and is presumably atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax detected.
