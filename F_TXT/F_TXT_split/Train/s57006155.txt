Compared with the prior study, there has been interval placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter, projecting in the region of the right hemidiaphragm. There is a small adjacent right basilar pneumothorax, which may be loculated, given that this is an upright view. The previous right effusion has significantly decreased in size, with residual atelectasis in the right lung base. The heart remains moderate to severely enlarged. No new focal consolidation.
