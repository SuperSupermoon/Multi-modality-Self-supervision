Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier. NG tube tip is in the stomach in appropriate position. Multifocal plate-like atelectasis in the lower lobes bilaterally are again noted. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Lines and tubes are in unchanged position including the right basal chest tube, with the sidehole outside the pleural cavity in the subcutaneous tissues. There is a tiny right pneumothorax. In the followup study that is available at the time of the interpretation of this study, the pneumothorax is not as conspicuous. Peripheral opacity in the right hemithorax is unchanged.
