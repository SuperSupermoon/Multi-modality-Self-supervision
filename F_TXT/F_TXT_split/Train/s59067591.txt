The Swan-Ganz catheter has been retracted, and now terminates in the proximal right pulmonary artery. The ET tube tip is in the mid trachea, and the NG tube courses below the hemidiaphragm to terminate in the stomach. Moderate diffuse bilateral airspace and interstitial opacities are most likely due to pulmonary edema. Small layering bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum are magnified by the projection. The patient has had prior cervical spine fusion.
