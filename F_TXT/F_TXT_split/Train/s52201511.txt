Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier. Lines and tubes are in standard positions. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema has markedly improved. Cardiac size is normal. The aorta is elongated. Dense consolidations through the lungs, especially on the left, have almost completely resolved. There are presumed small pleural effusions, larger on the left side, with associated adjacent atelectasis. Due to the extensive subcutaneous emphysema, evaluation of the presence of pneumothoraces is very limited.
