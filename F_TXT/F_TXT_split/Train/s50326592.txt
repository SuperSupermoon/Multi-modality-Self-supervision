Single portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of endotracheal tube, enteric tube, Swan-Ganz catheter and chest tubes. Lung volumes remain low. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged in appearance. Lung volumes are low with mild vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax. Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles may reflect small pleural effusions.
