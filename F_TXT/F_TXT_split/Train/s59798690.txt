Bibasilar pulmonary opacification has worsened substantially. This could be due entirely to atelectasis, but pneumonia is certainly a possibility, and aspiration could be responsible for either. Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusion is present. Previous pulmonary vascular and mediastinal venous engorgement have improved and there is no longer any pulmonary edema. ET tube and right PIC line are in standard placements. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. No pneumothorax.
