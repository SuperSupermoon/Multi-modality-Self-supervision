Cardiomediastinal silhouette including cardiomegaly is unchanged. Calcifications are again noted in the aortic arch. Low lung volumes persist. Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus could be due to atelectasis or a small effusion. Linear opacity at the left base is most compatible with atelectasis. The lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax.
