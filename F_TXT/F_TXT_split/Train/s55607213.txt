Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC/right atrial junction. Diffuse reticular and nodular opacities are again noted with worsening alveolar opacities, and interval increase in size of small to moderate right and small left pleural effusions. Increased fluid is seen loculated along the right lateral hemithorax. Previously noted right apical pneumothorax is no longer seen. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to evaluate but appear relatively unchanged.
