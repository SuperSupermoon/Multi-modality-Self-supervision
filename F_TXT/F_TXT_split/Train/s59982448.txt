Mild cardiomegaly is chronic. Lungs are grossly clear. The previously questioned left upper lobe lung nodule is not evident on this study, probably caused by superimposition of normal structures, particularly left suprahilar vessels on the previous examination. Thoracic aorta is tortuous in heavily calcified. No pleural abnormality.
