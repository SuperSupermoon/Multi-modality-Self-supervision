In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the nasogastric tube has been pushed forward so that the side port and tip are well within the stomach. Although the stomach remains dilated with air, this is much less prominent than on the previous examination. Endotracheal tube remains approximately 2.1 cm above the carina. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
