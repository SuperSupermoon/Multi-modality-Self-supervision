The endotracheal tube ends 4.1 cm above the carina. The right PICC ends in the upper SVC. There has been interval removal of the nasoenteric tube. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Linear atelectasis in the left lower lung is unchanged. There is no focal consolidation, substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are normal.
