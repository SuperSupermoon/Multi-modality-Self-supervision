1. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Left subclavian central line and endotracheal tube are unchanged in position. Linear opacity at the right base persists, likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis. Lung volumes remain diminished and there is prominent pulmonary vasculature consistent with known elevated pulmonary venous pressure. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-erect technique. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No large effusions are appreciated.
