There has been interval removal of a Swan-Ganz catheter, endotracheal tube, ascending vascular catheters and the enteric tube. EKG leads overlie the chest wall. The lung volumes are low with improving left retrocardiac/left lower lobe opacities. Likely small left pleural effusion with no pneumothorax. Stable cardiomegaly and aortic knob calcification. Bony thorax is unchanged. Upper abdomen is unremarkable.
