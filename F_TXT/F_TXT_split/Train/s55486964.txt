Lung volumes are low compared to the prior study resulting crowding of the pulmonary bronchovascular structures. Bilateral lower lobe airspace opacities with prominence of the hila is most consistent with congestive heart failure. There is left lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation. Probable left pleural effusion. A dual lead pacemaker is in-situ, unchanged in position when compared to the prior study and obscuring the left mid lung. He reverse right shoulder arthroplasty is noted.
