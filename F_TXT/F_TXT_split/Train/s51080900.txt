Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter has its tip in the right pulmonary artery. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. A right basilar chest tube remains in place along with the mediastinal drains. Status post median sternotomy with stably widened cardiac and mediastinal contours in this recently postoperative patient. Layering left effusion with retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. The mild interstitial edema is improving, although there is still likely a component of mild perihilar edema. No large pneumothorax is appreciated.
