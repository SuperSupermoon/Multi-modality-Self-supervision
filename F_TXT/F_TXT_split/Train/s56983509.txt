Patient is somewhat rotated. There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle is also seen. Underlying pleural effusion may be present. Midline trach is stable in position. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Patchy opacity at right lung base may be due to overlap of structures, versus atelectasis versus consolidation, but grossly stable compared to the prior study.
