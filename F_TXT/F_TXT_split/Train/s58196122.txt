There is a dual-lead pacemaker with leads again terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable allowing for small differences in orientation including cardiomegaly. There is similar to mildly increased mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, probably due to volume loss. Patchy left basilar opacities are most likely due to atelectasis. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The bones are probably demineralized. Evaluation is limited, but there is no definite fracture.
