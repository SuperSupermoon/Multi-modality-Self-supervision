Evaluation is limited due to patient body habitus. Lung volumes are low and exaggerate the pulmonary vascular markings. There is mild right basilar and left retrocardiac atelectasis; otherwise, the lungs are clear and without a focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. A tracheostomy button is noted in the upper trachea. Cardiac silhouette is exaggerated.
