There is distortion of the pulmonary bronchovascular markings suggestive of COPD. Lung volumes are within normal limits however. An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip terminates 3 cm above the level of the carina. A nasoenteric tube is in-situ, the tip is below the left hemidiaphragm however it is not visualized on this radiograph. No consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen. Minimally atelectasis at the left lung base.
