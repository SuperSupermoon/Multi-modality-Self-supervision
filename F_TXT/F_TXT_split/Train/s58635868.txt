AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged. The patient continues to be in pulmonary edema associated with bilateral large pleural effusions. Sharp angulation along the distal aspect of the enteric catheter is noted, most likely with no clinical significance. Previous radiopaque material projecting over the left upper quadrant is noted, related to previous splenectomy.
