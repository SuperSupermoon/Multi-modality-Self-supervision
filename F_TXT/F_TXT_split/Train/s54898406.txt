In comparison with the study of ___, the cardio mediastinal silhouette is stable. Increased opacification at the right base is consistent with small pleural effusion and atelectatic changes. On the left, there is increasing indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm. This is consistent with some increase in the degree of pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to completely exclude the possibility of superimposed pneumonia at the bases, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
