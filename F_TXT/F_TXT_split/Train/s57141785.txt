As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the two right-sided central venous lines and the nasogastric tube as well as the endotracheal tube are in constant position. There is improved ventilation at the lung bases with, on today's radiograph, only a small remnant left basal atelectasis. No new parenchymal opacity. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusions.
