Interval placement of a left pleural pigtail catheter in the costophrenic angle with decrease in the size of the pleural effusion and re-expansion of the left lung. There continue to be streaky opacities at the left base likely reflecting residual atelectasis. The right lung is grossly clear, although there is some prominence of the interstitium of uncertain significance. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach.
