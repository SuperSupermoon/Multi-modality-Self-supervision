A left internal jugular catheter terminates in the region of the high SVC or distal left brachiocephalic vein. Lung volumes are slightly low. There is mild to moderate pulmonary edema. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Heart size is top normal. There is widening of the soft tissue space between the left brachiocephalic vein and trachea, raising suspicion for hematoma.
