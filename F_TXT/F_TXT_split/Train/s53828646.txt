The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with mild cardiomegaly. Multifocal pulmonary opacities predominantly in the perihilar regions have improved since the recent prior study indicating that this is pulmonary edema. A small right pleural effusion is present. There is no pneumothorax. A right subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the cavoatrial junction. A Dobbhoff tube ends in the distal stomach.
