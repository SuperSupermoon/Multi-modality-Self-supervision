1. Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. A right internal jugular central line remains in place with its tip in the mid-to-distal SVC. Lung volumes are diminished and there is diffuse bilateral parenchymal abnormality. There are likely layering effusions. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the diffuse airspace process. When compared to the prior study, the airspace process is likely not significantly changed but appears more pronounced due to differences in lung volumes. No pneumothorax.
