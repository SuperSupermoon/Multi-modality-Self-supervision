Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiomegaly is difficult to evaluate due to the adjacent pleuroparenchymal abnormality. Right lower lobe consolidation and adjacent effusion is stable. Left pleural effusion is less conspicuous than before, likely due to difference in positioning of the patient. Left perihilar and left lower lobe opacities are likely atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
