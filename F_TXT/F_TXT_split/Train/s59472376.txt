Ap chest radiograph Current study as compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier demonstrates interval increase in left basal and medial most likely loculated pneumothorax. No substantial apical component is demonstrated, although small amount of pneumothorax in the bases is most likely present given the increased lucency. Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance. There is still present some extent of left retrocardiac atelectasis most likely consistent with partial collapse.
