The lung volumes are low and the patient's chin overlies the medial lung apices, obscuring the view. New opacities are seen overlying the mid to upper left lung. Streaky opacities at the lung bases bilaterally are likely secondary to atelectasis. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is persistent. Aorta is tortuous and calcified, however the hilar and mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable. Persistent blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles which coudl be due to persistent trace effusions. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
