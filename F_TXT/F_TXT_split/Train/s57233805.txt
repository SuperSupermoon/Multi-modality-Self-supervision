The ET tube is approximately 6 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm with side port in the expected region of the gastric fundus. A left central venous catheter terminates at the expected region of the upper SVC. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged compared to the prior examination.
