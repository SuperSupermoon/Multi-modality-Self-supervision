In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm. This is consistent with pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis in the left lower lung. Little change in the monitoring and support devices, with the tip of the endotracheal tube approximately 3.3 cm above the carina. There is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could reflect some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
