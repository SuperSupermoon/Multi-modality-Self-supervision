No previous images. There are low lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits without appreciable vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base. Mild blunting of the costophrenic angles suggests small pleural effusions. There is asymmetry of the breast shadows, raising the possibility of previous partial right mastectomy.
