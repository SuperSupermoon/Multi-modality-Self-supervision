Position of the chest tube is unchanged. No pneumothorax is positively identified. Low lung volumes are again noted but some opacities are seen particularly in the left mid zone and pneumonic consolidation or aspiration could be present in this region. The degree of failure may be present, but this is hard to evaluate in the presence of low lung volumes. Extensive spinal hardware is present. Gas-filled loops of large and small bowel are present indicating probable ileus.
