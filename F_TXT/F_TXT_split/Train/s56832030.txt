As compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, diffuse interstitial opacities have worsened and likely represent progressive interstitial edema.

Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful for more complete assessment following diuresis, at which time an asymmetrical opacity at the right apex may also be more fully assessed.
