AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination with patient in supine position and dated ___. Again mild cardiac enlargement is probably present. No typical configuration abnormalities are identified. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. The previously identified right-sided basal pulmonary parenchymal abnormality is not seen anymore and the right lateral pleural sinus is free. On the other hand on the left base a linear plate atelectasis has developed and has progressed slightly in comparison with the findings on the preceding chest examination. No other new discrete local pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates can be identified suggesting the presence of a pneumonia. No pneumothorax is seen.
