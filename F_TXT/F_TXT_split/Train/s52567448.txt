1. Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian central line are unchanged in position. The left subclavian central line has been removed. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given portable technique. Lung volumes remain low. The subtle patchy opacity at the right base and possibly in the retrocardiac region is unchanged and would favor atelectasis given the low lung volumes. No effusions. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
