As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Plate-like atelectasis at both lung bases. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities, no pulmonary edema. No visible pleural effusions on the frontal image. The presence of small pleural effusions in the dorsal parts of the sinuses cannot be excluded. The right internal jugular vein catheter has been removed in the interval.
