Endotracheal tube terminates in standard position, approximately 4.4 cm from the carina. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen on this supine exam. There are no displaced fractures identified.
