1. Hyperinflation of the lungs with associated parenchymal distortion and biapical linear opacities, all likely related to known underlying emphysema. Patchy opacities at both bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Heart is stably enlarged. Mediastinal contours are notable for a prominent pulmonary artery which may reflect underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax. Blunting of both costophrenic angles may reflect small effusions versus chronic pleural thickening.
