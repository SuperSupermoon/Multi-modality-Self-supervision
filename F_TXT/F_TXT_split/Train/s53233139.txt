1. Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which has its tip 7 cm above the carina. Advancement several centimeters would be advised. Nasogastric tube has also been placed and is seen coursing below the diaphragm. The right chest tube remains unchanged in position. 2. There continues to be hazy opacity at the right base and right mid lung, likely representing layering of fluid within the pleural cavity with some associated atelectasis. Bibasilar air bronchograms are seen likely reflecting atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia cannot be excluded. Linear opacities at the left base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax. A wet reading of this study was provided to ___, the trauma nurse, ___ ___. ___ on ___ at 21:25.
