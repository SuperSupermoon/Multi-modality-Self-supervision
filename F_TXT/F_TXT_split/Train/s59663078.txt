As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The right internal jugular vein catheter is in unchanged position. The lung volumes have slightly increased, reflecting improved ventilation, notably at the left lung bases. Mild fluid overload, however, persists. No new focal parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
