Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increased opacification of the bilateral bases, left greater than right, which likely represents atelectasis and/or aspiration. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation. The endotracheal tube ends 6.7 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field-of-view.
