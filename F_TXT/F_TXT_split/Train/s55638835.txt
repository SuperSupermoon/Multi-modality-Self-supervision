A pleural catheter has been placed, terminating in the left lung apex. There is a persistent moderate-sized pneumothorax (which can be quantified as a distance between the superior lung edge and pleura of up to 2.5 cm), but the lung has expanded considerably since the prior study and rightward shift of mediastinal structures has also resolved. There is no definite fluid component no this AP view. The patient is status post left lower lobectomy. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.
