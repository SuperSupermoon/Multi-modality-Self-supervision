In comparison with the study of ___, the PICC line is unchanged with the tip in the mid portion of the SVC. There is increased opacification at the left base, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Some indistinctness of pulmonary markings, especially at the right base, raises the possibility of some asymmetric pulmonary edema.
