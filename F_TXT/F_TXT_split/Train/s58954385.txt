A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea and intact sternal wires. There is moderate cardiomegaly and marked atherosclerotic calcification. Increased bilateral opacities and obscuration of the bilateral hemidiaphragms is consistent with increased mild pulmonary edema and probable small pleural effusions, superimposed on background interstitial lung disease.
