The overall appearance is similar. No obvious pneumothorax is detected in either lung. Again seen is the right-sided chest tube with opacification at the right lung base, presumably a small to moderate right pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis and probable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Right paratracheal opacity is unchanged. There is continued vascular plethora. Aside from minimal basilar atelectasis and a small left effusion, left lung remains grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged. Linear density previously seen over the right lung, question epidural catheter, is no longer visualized.
