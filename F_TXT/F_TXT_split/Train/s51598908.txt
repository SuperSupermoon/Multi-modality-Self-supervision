AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Left lung is reasonably well expanded and shows no pulmonary edema. The right lung base, particularly medially is consolidated. One would expect atelectasis at least early post-operatively. Heart is moderately enlarged and mediastinal vessels widened the mediastinum. ET tube in standard placement. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion is small on the right if any. Spring-loaded device projects over the right lower lobe bronchial tree. Subsequent chest radiograph should be taken with care to clear this area to exclude the possibility of aspirated material.
