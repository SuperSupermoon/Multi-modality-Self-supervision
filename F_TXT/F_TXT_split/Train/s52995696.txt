Increased lucency along the right heart border corresponds with minimal pneumomediastinum seen on recent CT abdomen. No apical pneumothorax is evident. There is no free air below the diaphragm. The lungs are clear. There is no focal consolidation. No pulmonary vascular congestion or overt edema is identified. There is new mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with a developing small pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
