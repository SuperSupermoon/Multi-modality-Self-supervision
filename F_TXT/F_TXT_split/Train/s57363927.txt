Bilateral multifocal opacities have increased in density and extent, greater on the right than left, with continued sparing of the left upper lung. This appearance suggests worsening of a prior multifocal infectious process. New on this radiograph is suggestion of a small to moderate pleural effusion on the right side, which is difficult to quantify, although potentially loculated. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are somewhat obscured but there is no indication that these are likely to have changed. There is no pneumothorax or evidence for pleural effusion on the left.
