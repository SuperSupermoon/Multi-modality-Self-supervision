Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position except for a Swan-Ganz catheter which terminates in the right hilar region in the expected location of the intralobar right pulmonary artery. This could be withdrawn approximately 2 cm for standard positioning. Confluent bibasilar opacities have worsened, and remain more marked on the left than the right. Differential diagnosis includes atelectasis, aspiration and infectious pneumonia. Small to moderate left pleural effusion has also increased in size.
