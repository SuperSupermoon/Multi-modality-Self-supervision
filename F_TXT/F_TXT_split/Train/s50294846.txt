Upright AP radiograph of the chest. There are dense bilateral perihilar and right lower lung opacities along with more diffuse nodular opacities, more constraint in the upper lungs bilaterally. The left lung base is relatively spared. Increased lucency at the right lung base is suspicious for pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion. The stomach is distended. No displaced fracture is identified. The heart size is normal.
