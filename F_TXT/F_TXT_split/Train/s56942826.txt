Support lines and tubing are unchanged in position when compared to the prior study. Catheter tubing projecting over the left heart border is presumed to represent a pericardial drain. Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study with persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. Mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with haziness of the upper lobe pulmonary vessels consistent with a mild degree of congestive heart failure. No pneumothorax seen. A hazy airspace opacity in the left lower lung is similar when compared to the prior study and likely represents atelectasis.
