Extremely rapid clearing of what was dense right suprahilar consolidation suggests this was asymmetric pulmonary edema. Now right lower lobe consolidation is more pronounced, and raises the same differential diagnosis either another location for asymmetric pulmonary edema or concurrent pneumonia as pulmonary edema clears. In the left lung pulmonary edema is milder, with the interstitial quality. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette between ___ and ___ was substantial, subsequently stable. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. No pneumothorax. ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements respectively and a feeding tube ends in the mid portion of the stomach.
