Single portable view of the chest. No prior. Relatively low lung volumes are seen. Streaky bibasilar opacities are seen potentially due to atelectasis noting that aspiration cannot be completely excluded. The lungs superiorly are clear, were not obscured by overlying leads. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
