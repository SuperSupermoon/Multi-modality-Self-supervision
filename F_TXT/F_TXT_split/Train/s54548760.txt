Lung volumes remain quite low but the only focal atelectasis is in the right lower lobe. Heart size normal. Upper lungs clear. Leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet is due to deflection by either a small adjacent mass, usually in the thyroid, or tortuous or dilated head neck vessels.
