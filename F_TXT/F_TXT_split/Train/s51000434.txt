The tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach. There is minimally further increasing evidence of pulmonary edema and slight increase in extent of the preexisting left pleural effusion. The size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be moderately enlarged. No evidence of pneumothorax. The left pectoral Port-A-Cath is constant.
