Comparison is made to the prior radiographs from ___. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 3.3 cm above the carina. There is a left-sided pacemaker. Median sternotomy wires are seen. The heart size is prominent, and there is prominence of the mediastinum. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There are opacities seen throughout both lung fields more confluent within the upper lobes. This may represent pulmonary interstitial lung disease; however, superimposed pulmonary edema or infiltrate would be difficult to exclude, particularly in the right upper lobe and the left base. No pneumothoraces are seen.
