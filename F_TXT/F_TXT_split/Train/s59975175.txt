Again seen is an right sided indwelling catheter with tip at SVC/RA junction an NG tube, with tip and side-port curled in the expected location of the gastric fundus. There are low inspiratory volumes, similar to 1 day earlier. Triangular opacity at the left base medially, with new obscuration of the medial left hemidiaphragm, could reflect some superimposed atelectasis. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is vascular plethora, likely accentuated by low lung volumes and patchy atelectasis at the right lung base. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well delineated due to low inspiratory volumes. Prominence of the right hilar region probably reflects part of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, accentuated by low lung volumes and differences in rotation. No pneumothorax detected.
