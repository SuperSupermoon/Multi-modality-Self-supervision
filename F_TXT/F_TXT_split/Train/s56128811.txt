No interval change from prior study. Lines and tubes are in unchanged position. There is no evident pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Diffuse right lung opacity is a combination of effusion and atelectasis, probably unchanged from prior study allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Small left effusion with adjacent atelectasis has increased.
