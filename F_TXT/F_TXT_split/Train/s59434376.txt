1. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and left subclavian central line are unchanged in position. Lung volumes remain markedly low with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature and bibasilar opacities suggestive of partial lower lobe atelectasis. Probable layering bilateral effusions. No pneumothorax. Given the markedly low lung volumes, assessment of cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult.
