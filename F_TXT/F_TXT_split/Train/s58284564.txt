AP chest compared to ___ and ___: Previous right upper lobe suprahilar consolidation or atelectasis has continued to improve, and pulmonary vascular congestion is no longer as severe. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions have increased, however. A large hollow viscus in the midline is in a hiatus hernia. I cannot tell whether it is the stomach or colon. There is no pneumothorax.
