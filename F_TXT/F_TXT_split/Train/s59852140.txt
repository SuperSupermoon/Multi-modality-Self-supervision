As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a marked improvement. The pre-existing pulmonary edema has decreased in severity but is still clearly visible. However, the pre-described opacities at the right lateral aspect of the hemithorax, which corresponded to an intrafissural effusion, has almost completely resolved. Also markedly improved is a pre-existing right upper lobe opacity. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. No new parenchymal changes.
