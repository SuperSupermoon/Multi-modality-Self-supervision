As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously seen Dobbhoff catheter has been advanced and is now positioned in the lower part of the large hiatal hernia. The device is partly overlaid by the vertebral stabilization devices. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged bilateral pleural effusions. Bilateral areas of atelectasis. Mild fluid overload is present. In the interval, there is no evidence of newly appeared parenchymal changes potentially suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
