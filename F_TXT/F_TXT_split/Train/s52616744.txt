Lung volumes are slightly decreased compared to the prior exam. Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette persists. The mediastinal contour is unchanged. Calcifications of the aortic knob are again demonstrated. There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema, slightly worse compared to the prior exam. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is definitively noted. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
