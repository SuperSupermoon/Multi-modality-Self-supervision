There are low lung volumes. There is mild cardiomegaly. The aorta is tortuous. Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side likely atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. When feasible repeat radiographs, PA and lateral, are recommended for better evaluation of the lung parenchyma, especially to evaluate an irregular opacity in the left lower perihilar region.
