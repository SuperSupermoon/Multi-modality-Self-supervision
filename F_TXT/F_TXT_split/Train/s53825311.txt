The new enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view within the massively distended stomach. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. Evaluation for pneumothorax is limited as the apices are excluded from the field of view. Surgical clips project over the left upper quadrant. Posterior spinal fusion hardware is partially imaged. Chronic appearing left-sided rib deformities are related to prior fracture. In addition to the massively distended, multiple distended loops of small bowel fill the upper abdomen.
