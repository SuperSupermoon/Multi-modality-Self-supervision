Assessment of fine detail is considerably limited by overlying soft tissues and underpenetration. ET tube ends approximately 5 cm above the carina. The enteric tube is seen at least to the level of the lower chest but is not seen definitively beyond that. Lung volumes are low which accentuates likely mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax detected. Patchy opacities in retrocardiac and right cardiophrenic regions are indeterminate, as the could be accounted for by atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
