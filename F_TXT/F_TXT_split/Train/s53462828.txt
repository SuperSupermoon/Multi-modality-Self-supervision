Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval placement of an NG tube, which terminates in the stomach. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina. The left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged in position, with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. One of the median sternotomy wires adjacent to the left sixth rib is broken, which was present since at least ___. Lung volumes are low. There is bibasilar atelectasis, worse on the left. Of note, a portion of the left inferolateral hemithorax is not captured on this study, but there is likely a pleural effusion on the left. No pneumothorax. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is stable in appearance. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aortic arch.
