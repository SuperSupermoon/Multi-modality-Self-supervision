AP chest compared to ___, 4:57 p.m.: There is definitely greater opacification projecting over the right lung now than earlier, but I am unsure what it is, probably basilar atelectasis and new pleural effusion. Left lower lobe is clearly severely atelectatic. Increase in pulmonary vascular caliber relative to film when the patient was supine, suggests volume overload. Left subclavian line ends centrally. Left axillary PICC line on the earlier examination is probably still present. ET tube in standard position. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
