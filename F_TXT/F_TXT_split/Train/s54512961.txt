Slight increase in severe cardiomegaly could be due to differences in cardiac cycling as well as slight increase in cardiomegaly. Pulmonary vasculature is slightly more distended, but there is no pulmonary edema or focal consolidation. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. Focal thickening of the right lateral costal pleura is due to adjacent chronic rib fractures, one not unhealed.
