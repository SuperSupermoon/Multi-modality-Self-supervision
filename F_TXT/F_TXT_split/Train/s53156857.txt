AP supine portable chest radiograph obtained. Interval placement of an endotracheal tube which is seen with its tip approximately 2.7 cm above the carina. There has also been placement of an orogastric tube with its tip coiled in the left upper abdomen. There is increased opacity in the upper lungs bilaterally, right greater than left, which given the interval change could reflect aspiration. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. AICD is also unchanged.
