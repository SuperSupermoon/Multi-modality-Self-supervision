AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a coiling NG tube in the esophagus that should be repositioned. The left PICC line tip is not clearly seen but appears to be grossly unchanged since the prior study, terminating at the left subclavian/brachiocephalic vein. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged as well as there is no change in bibasal atelectasis. Right pleural effusion appears to be decreased as compared to the prior study, but that may reflect different position of the patient and redistribution of the fluid.
