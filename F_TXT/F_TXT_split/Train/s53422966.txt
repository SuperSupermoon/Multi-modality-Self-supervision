Interval repositioning of feeding tube, has been withdrawn into the proximal stomach, with side port above the GE junction level. Lung volumes are increased compared to the prior study with associated improved aeration at the right lung base. Persistent left retrocardiac opacity is likely a combination of left lower lobe atelectasis and small-to-moderate pleural effusion. A small partially layering right pleural effusion is also evident. Dr. ___ was successfully paged to discuss the position of the feeding tube at 10:45 a.m. at the time of discovery on ___.
