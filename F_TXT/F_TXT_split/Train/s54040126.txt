Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates in mid trachea. Right internal jugular transvenous pacing wire is looped in the right pulmonary artery can be withdrawn approximately 16 cm for more optimal positioning within the right ventricle. Diffuse haze over the right hemithorax likely reflects layering pleural effusion. Increased pulmonary vascular congestion is also seen without focal consolidation. The heart is modestly enlarged with normal mediastinal contours. There is no pneumothorax. At least 1 right rib fracture is suggested.
