As compared to the previous radiograph, the left chest tube was removed. The apical portion of the pre-existing pneumothorax is unchanged. However, along the lateral chest wall, the pneumothorax appears to have slightly increased in extent. The volume of the left hemi thorax is smaller than before and the extent of a left pleural effusion has slightly increased. No change in appearance of the right lung.
