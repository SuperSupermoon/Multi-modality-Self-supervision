As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. A double-lumen catheter on the right is unchanged. The parenchymal opacities are apparently slightly increased in severity, but part of this impression might be due to reduced lung volumes. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusions.
