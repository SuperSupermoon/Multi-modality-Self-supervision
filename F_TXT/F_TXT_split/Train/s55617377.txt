As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, moderate cardiomegaly, minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. The monitoring and support devices are constant. No evidence of pneumothorax.
