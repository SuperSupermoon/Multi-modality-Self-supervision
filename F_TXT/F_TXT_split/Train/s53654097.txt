In comparison with study of ___, the nasogastric tube is been removed and replaced with a Dobhoff tube that extends to the lower body of the stomach. Continued low lung volumes accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration the hemidiaphragm is again consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Increasing opacification at the right base suggests small pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis at this side as well. There is engorgement of indistinct pulmonary vessels, consistent with increasing pulmonary venous congestion.
