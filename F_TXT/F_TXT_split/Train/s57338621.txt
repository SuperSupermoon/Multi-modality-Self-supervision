Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The right-sided PICC is again seen terminating in the distal SVC. The lungs are hyperinflated consistent with COPD/emphysema. There is interval mild increase in opacity at the right lung apex; an underlying infectious process may be present. Recommend followup to resolution in this patient with emphysema. There is also linear scarring/atelectasis at the left lung base in similar distribution to that seen on the prior study. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Metallic hardware is partially imaged along the spine.
