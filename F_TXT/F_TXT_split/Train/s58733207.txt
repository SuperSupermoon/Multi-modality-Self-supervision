The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is somewhat increased opacification of the right costophrenic sulcus with elevation and flattening which may reflect scarring or atelectasis associated with a small persistent pleural effusion, but this appearance is unlikely to reflect an acute process. To some extent, this opacification was present on the prior examination, although less prominent. There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the left. There is no pneumothorax. A patchy focal opacity projecting over the right upper lobe suggests minor scarring which is unchanged. An oval nodular focus projecting over the left lower lung probably is due to a nipple shadow.
