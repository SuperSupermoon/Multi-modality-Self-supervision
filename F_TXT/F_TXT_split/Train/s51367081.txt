The study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. Right PICC has been removed. The heart size remains moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle with right basilar patchy opacity appears unchanged, likely reflecting chronic pleural thickening with associated atelectasis or scarring. Left lung is clear. No new areas of focal consolidation are demonstrated. There is no pneumothorax or new pleural effusion. Chronic left anterior shoulder dislocation is re- demonstrated. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is incompletely visualized.
