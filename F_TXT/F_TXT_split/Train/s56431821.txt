Bilateral small pleural effusions persist and are minimally improved from the prior exam if at all. A focal opacity just above the pleural effusions is probably loculated pleural fluid along the minor fissure. Adjacent compressive atelectasis is minimally improved. Lung volumes remain low. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right pulmonary edema is mild. Aortic knob calcifications again noted. The left PICC line is unchanged and ends in the distal SVC. The left internal jugular vein ends at the origin of the left brachiocephalic vein. No pneumothorax.
