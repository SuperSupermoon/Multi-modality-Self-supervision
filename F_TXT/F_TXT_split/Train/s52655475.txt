Single portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained. The cardiac silhouette appears normal and unchanged compared to the prior examination. Mild mediastinal prominence is likely related to differences in patient positioning and technique. The lungs demonstrate low volumes as before, but are otherwise clear without focal consolidation. There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
