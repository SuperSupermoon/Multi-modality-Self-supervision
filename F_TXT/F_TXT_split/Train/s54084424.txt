An endotracheal tube terminates 7.6 cm above the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and its tip terminates in the gastric fundus. Moderate-to- severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. The right hemidiaphragm is not visualized, likely related to the presence of a moderate to large pleural effusion. Small left-sided pleural effusion is present. Left lower lobe opacity could reflect atelectasis, however, a superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There is no definite pneumothorax. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
