Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Again seen is moderate postoperative atelectasis in the retrocardiac region, which is unchanged, as well as a persistent small left-sided pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
