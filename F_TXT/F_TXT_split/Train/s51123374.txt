Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Heterogeneous opacities in the left lower lobe have slightly progressed, and widespread poorly defined nodular opacities also appear slightly more conspicuous. The patient has a known underlying MAC infection with bronchiectasis and centrilobular nodules on prior chest CT of ___. The worsening multifocal opacities as compared to that time could reflect the clinically suspected diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia superimposed upon chronic changes related to atypical mycobacterial infection. Chronic volume loss and bronchiectasis in right middle lobe and lingula appear grossly unchanged.
