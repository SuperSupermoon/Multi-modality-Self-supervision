The lungs remain relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Platelike right base atelectasis is seen. There are subtle scattered areas of opacity projecting over the lateral left upper to mid lung, and possibly to a lesser extent over the right lung, which may be related patient's known metastatic disease, but underlying infection is not excluded. There is slight blunting of the costophrenic angles and trace pleural effusions may be present. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. The mediastinal contours are stable.
