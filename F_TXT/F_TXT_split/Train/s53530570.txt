Endotracheal tube is seen coursing into the proximal right main stem bronchus with near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax. Again, repositioning is recommended. On the subsequent CT the ET tube was seen to be above the level of the carina. There has been slight improvement in aeration of the left upper lung. The right lung is clear. Enteric tube course below the level of the diaphragm into at least the proximal aspect of the stomach. The cardiac silhouette at the left aspect is not well assessed due to the left hemithorax opacification. Bilateral diaphragmatic plaques again suggest the prior asbestos exposure.
