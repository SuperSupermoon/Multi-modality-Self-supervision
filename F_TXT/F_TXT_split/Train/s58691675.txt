As compared to ___ radiograph, the patient is substantially rotated to the left. Additionally, lower lung volumes result an accentuation of the cardiomediastinal contours and crowding of bronchovascular structures. New linear opacities in the right perihilar and left basilar region are suggestive of atelectasis. Considering clinical concern for infection, repeat nonrotated radiograph with improved lung volumes is suggested for more complete assessment of the lungs with patient's condition persists.
