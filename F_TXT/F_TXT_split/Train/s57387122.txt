Symmetrically distributed pulmonary abnormality improved between ___ and ___, probably edema, followed by development of progressively enlarging pleural effusions which are now quite large and obscure most of the lungs. Heart is not greatly enlarged, but cannot be assessed because of the adjacent pleural abnormalities. Mediastinal veins are mildly distended. Chest CT scanning would be very helpful to assess the condition of the lungs and the volume of pleural effusion obscuring them. There is no pneumothorax. Left jugular line ends in the upper SVC.
