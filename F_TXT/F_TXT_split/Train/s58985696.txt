The endotracheal tube is approximately 2.5 cm from the carina. A right internal jugular ends in the right atrium just beyond the superior atriocaval junction. A feeding tube is in the stomach. The bilateral diffuse hazy opacifications have increased since the prior study, which may be due to slightly more edema or accentuation of stable edema due to lower lung volumes from a recent reduction in PEEP. New bilateral pleural effusions are present. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.
