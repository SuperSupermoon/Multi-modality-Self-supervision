1. Nasogastric tube still has its tip at the gastroesophageal junction and the side port in the mid esophagus. Repositioning is advised. The house staff is aware. 2. Left hemidiaphragm remains somewhat elevated. The more rounded opacity at the left paraspinal region abutting the left diaphragm is again seen, and although may represent a hiatal hernia, imaging with a PA and lateral study to further characterize this finding would be advised. Lungs appear grossly clear. No pneumothorax. Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the proximal superior vena cava. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient rotation on the current study.
