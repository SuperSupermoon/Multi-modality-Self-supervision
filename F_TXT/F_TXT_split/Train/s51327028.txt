Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated, similar compared to the previous exam. Widening of the mediastinum is also unchanged, and attributable to the presence of mediastinal lipomatosis. Aortic contour is unchanged. There is mild pulmonary edema, with right basilar opacification likely reflecting a combination of atelectasis and a small right pleural effusion. Patchy left basilar opacity is also noted and a small left pleural effusion cannot be fully excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are noted with degenerative spurring and subchondral sclerosis.
