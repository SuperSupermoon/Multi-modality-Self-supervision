The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Although asymmetric, widespread bilateral opacification includes interstitial and hazy opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema. Opacity at the medial right lung base obscuring the right diaphragm is not completely specific but suggests atelectasis and was to some extent present before. The bones appear demineralized. A moderate lower thoracic compression fracture is probably unchanged.
