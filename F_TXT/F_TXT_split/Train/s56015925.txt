There has been marked interval worsening of right mid and right lower lobe consolidations consistent with pneumonia. Left lower lobe larger of atelectases is minimally improved. Mild vascular congestion is mildly increased. Left pleural effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper SVC. There is no evident pneumothorax. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated
