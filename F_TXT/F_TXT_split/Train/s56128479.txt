As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above the carinal. The course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged, with the tip projecting over the proximal parts of the stomach and the side hole at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. The opacity at the right lung base as well as the retrocardiac atelectasis persist. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
