As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The left chest tube is in constant position. Constant appearance of the cardiac silhouette and the lung parenchyma, with moderate bilateral pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax, bilateral areas of atelectasis and mild fluid overload. Sternal wires and clips after CABG as well as left subclavian vein catheter are unchanged.
