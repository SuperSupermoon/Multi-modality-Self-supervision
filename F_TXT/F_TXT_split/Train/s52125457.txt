AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination obtained seven hours earlier during the same day. Left-sided thoracocentesis has been performed during the interval. Left-sided pleural effusion has regressed but is not completely eliminated. Some improvement of left-sided pulmonary aeration is noted. There is no evidence of any remaining pneumothorax in the apical area.
