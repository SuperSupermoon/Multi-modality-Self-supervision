A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The nasogastric tube ends in the neoesophagus. Two mediastinal drains are in place. A right Port-A-Cath ends in the right atrium. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. There is left basilar linear atelectasis. No pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The prominent right mediastinal contour is due to the neo-esophagus.
