Assessment is limited due to rotation of the patient which in particular limits assessment of the cardiomediastinal contour. An apparent right hilar mass is likely due to the obliquity of the projection. In addition there are hazy opacities in the bilateral lungs with prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild pulmonary edema. A linear opacity in the right mid lung is consistent with atelectasis. No pneumothorax seen. Degenerative changes in the right shoulder. Possible right-sided seventh rib fracture. No pneumothorax seen. Old healed fracture of the left seventh rib posteriorly.
