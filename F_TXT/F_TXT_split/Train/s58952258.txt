Frontal radiographs of the chest demonstrate top normal heart size. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. Increase opacity in the left lower lung could be due to overlying soft tissues, but could represent infection in the correct clinical setting. Vague opacity in the left lower lung unchanged from prior study and previously characterized on CT at subpleural fat. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No displaced rib fracture identified.
