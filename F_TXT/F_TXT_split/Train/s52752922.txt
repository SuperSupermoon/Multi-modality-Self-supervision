In comparison with the study of ___, there is an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 5.6 cm above the carina. Allowing for differences in obliquity of the patient, there is probably little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Again there is extensive opacification involving the left base, consistent with volume loss in the left lower low, which could well be combined with superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the side-hole is not well seen.
