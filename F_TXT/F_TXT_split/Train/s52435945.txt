Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. Patient is quite rotated to his right which limits the evaluation of the lower lungs and mediastinum. Allowing for this, there is no definite evidence of pneumonia or CHF. No large effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size appears stable. The mediastinal contour appears grossly unchanged. The bony structures are intact. Vascular calcifications project over the mediastinum.
