Moderate left pleural effusion has enlarged, but moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved slightly in the right lung. ET tube, left supraclavicular central venous dual catheter, Swan-Ganz catheter, and upper enteric drainage tube are all in standard placements. Heart is normal size. The left lower lobe consolidation is probably atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
