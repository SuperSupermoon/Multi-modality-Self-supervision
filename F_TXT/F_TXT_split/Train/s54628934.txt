Lungs are low in volume, and there may be more focal atelectasis at the right lung base, but lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pulmonary edema, and no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart is borderline enlarged, exaggerated by extremely low lung volumes and supine positioning. ET tube in standard placement.
