Patient is status post median sternotomy and prosthetic valve replacement. Moderate cardiomegaly is demonstrated. The mediastinal contour is unremarkable except for diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications within the thoracic aorta. Mild pulmonary edema is present with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also present, slightly larger on the right. Patchy atelectasis is noted in the lung bases, though infection in the right lung base is not completely excluded in the correct clinical setting. No pneumothorax is identified.
