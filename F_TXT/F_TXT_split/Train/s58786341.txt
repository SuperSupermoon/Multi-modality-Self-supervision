Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There is interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 6.5 cm above the carina. Additionally, a nasogastric tube is seen, distal tip projecting over the left main stem bronchus, may be in the proximal esophagus or in the airway; either way, is in inappropriate position and should be repositioned. The findings and recommendations regarding the nasogastric tube were discussed with Dr. ___ on ___ at 9:50 p.m. via telephone by Dr. ___. There is increased right lung opacity/consolidation and left mid-to-lower lung opacity, which could be due to infection and/or aspiration. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. No pneumothorax is seen. No large pleural effusion.
