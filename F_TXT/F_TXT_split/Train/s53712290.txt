As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain low. There is unchanged evidence of bilateral atelectatic changes at the lung bases. No additional parenchymal opacities, notably non-suggesting pneumonia. The appearance of the left chest wall is constant, with an unchanged evidence of a minimally abnormal lateral contour of the sixth rib, but without cortical changes or cortical discontinuation. No pleural effusions, no pneumothorax.
