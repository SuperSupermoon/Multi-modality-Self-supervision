A single portable frontal view of the chest was performed. The lung volumes are low. There is a moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral patchy opacities. Blunting of the costophrenic angles indicates probable bilateral pleural effusions, but could be confirmed with a lateral view. These findings are consistent with moderate to severe pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
