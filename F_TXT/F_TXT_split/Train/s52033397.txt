The post-thoracocentesis radiograph demonstrates substantial decrease in the left pleural loculation. Currently, the pigtail catheter is in place. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is still present left basal opacity, most likely reflecting area of atelectasis and residual pleural effusion. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Lungs are hyperinflated but essentially clear.
