ETT tube, NG tube, and right and left IJ lines are similar to the prior study. Again seen is the left chest tube. The sideport now lies slightly more proximal/ lateral, partially overlying the left chest wall, suggesting slight interval retraction. Allowing for this, the appearance of left lung is grossly unchanged, with increased retrocardiac density, hazy density along the left chest wall, and fluid tracking along the left lung apex. Suspect left pleural effusion. No left-sided pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema along the left chest wall. The appearance of the right lung is also similar, with evidence for interstitial edema, hazy opacity at the right base, and probable small effusion. Lucency previously seen along the right chest wall raising the possibility of a skin fold versus pneumothorax is no longer visualized. No evidence of right-sided pneumothorax is detected on the current study. Cardiomegaly, prosthetic valve, and sternotomy wires, are similar to prior. There is CHF, with interstitial and probable alveolar edema, which may be very slightly improved compared 1 day previous. Again seen is an iatrogenic linear density, with tip overlying the lateral border of the scapula. The appearance is suggestive of a PICC line, though note is made that is not that it does not extend into the chest itself. The appearance is unchanged compared with ___ at 13 44.
