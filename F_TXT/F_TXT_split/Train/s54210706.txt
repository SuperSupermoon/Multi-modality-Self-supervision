Since the prior exam, the Swan-Ganz catheter and left-sided chest tube have been removed. A right internal jugular sheath is in unchanged position with the tip likely in the very upper SVC. There is no pneumothorax. A small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis is not significantly changed from the prior exam. There is a small left pleural effusion with basilar atelectasis, which appears slightly larger than on the prior exam. The lung volumes are low. There is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Sternal wires are intact.
