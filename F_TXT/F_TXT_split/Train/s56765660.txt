Previous pulmonary edema has resolved. Right lung is entirely clear. Left lower lobe partially obscured by the large cardiac silhouette is probably persistently atelectatic.There is at least a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged recently, probably improved since ___. Left pigtail drainage catheter is unchanged in position, unusually placed for an intended pleural drain, projecting over the pulmonary outflow tract. The left ventricular assist device is grossly unchanged in position. Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead also the stable in position. Right PIC line can be traced as far as the mid SVC but the tip is obscured. Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
