Additionally, a more band like opacity in the left lower lung is most compatible with atelectasis. No large effusion is seen. No large pneumothorax. The aorta is unfolded. The heart appears top-normal in size. Prominent calcifications in the base of neck likely vascular. No acute bony abnormalities.
