Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely calcified. A moderate to large layering right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion are present, with the right pleural effusion likely larger in size in the interval. Lung volumes are low with patchy opacities the lung bases likely reflective of compressive atelectasis. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No large pneumothorax is demonstrated. Right PICC has been removed.
