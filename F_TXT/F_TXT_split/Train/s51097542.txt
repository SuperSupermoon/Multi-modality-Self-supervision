Cardiomegaly again noted. There is hilar congestion and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Lower lung opacities may reflect edema though a superimposed pneumonia difficult to exclude. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present. No pneumothorax. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. Bony structures are intact.
