Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval improvement in right lower lobe opacification. Persistent right pleural effusion is moderate in size. Left pleural effusion has decreased in size over the interval, and now is small. Bilateral peribronchovascular infiltration has improved, but is persistent. Nodular opacities are less confluent as compared to the prior radiograph. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The fragment of the left-sided subclavian central venous line is in unchanged position. The right-sided central venous line is in unchanged position, with the tip ending at the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
