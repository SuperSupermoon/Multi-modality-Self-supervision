AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable AP single view chest examination of ___. There is now status post recent sternotomy and cardiac intervention with new midline row of circular thoracotomy wires. The patient is intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea some 2 cm above the level of the carina. Some withdrawal by 1-2 cm is recommended to avoid mechanical obstruction. Previously described right-sided PICC line, permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position with evidence of biventricular electrodes with ECD and trans-coronary-venous stimulation appear unchanged. Heart size is unaltered and pulmonary vascular congestive pattern not increased. Other new instruments include a new right internal jugular approach sheath that apparently carries a Swan-Ganz catheter, the tip of which reaches the central portion of the pulmonary artery. A large metallic tubular device (probably LVAD) is overlying the upper abdomen. The most right-sided portion is overlying the area of right upper abdomen and probably aiming for connection with the inferior vena cava. The left-sided portion of the device is overlying the left-sided diaphragm with the upper portion separated by an approximately 1-2 cm diastasis and also observes the presence of a large mediastinal drainage tube and a left-sided chest tube advanced from below. Again, there is no evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates or significantly advanced pulmonary congestion and no pneumothorax exists in the apical area. Referring physician, ___ was paged to discuss findings. Subsequent referral was made to ___, who was paged at 4:45 p.m. to discuss detail of findings.
