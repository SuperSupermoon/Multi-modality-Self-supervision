Pacer device remains in place. Opacification at the left base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia. The vertebral bodies are difficult to see on this study so that the degree of compression deformity cannot be adequately assessed.
