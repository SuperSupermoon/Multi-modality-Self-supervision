New tracheostomy tube is midline. There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. Substantial atelectasis persists at the right lung base, and decrease in lung volumes generally is probably responsible for vascular crowding and platelike atelectasis at the left base. Heart size is normal but increased since earlier in the day and pulmonary vascular engorgement suggests volume overload or early cardiac decompensation.
