There has been interval development of pneumomediastinum with air tracking into the fascia planes of the neck. No large pneumothorax is identified. Heart size remains moderately enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. Coarse diffuse interstitial opacities are noted bilaterally compatible with known fibrosing chronic interstitial lung disease. Increased opacities at the lung bases likely rib reflect superimposed atelectasis. No new large pleural effusion or pulmonary edema is definitively present. Surgical anchor projects over the right humeral head. Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine. Multiple clips are noted in the left upper abdomen.
