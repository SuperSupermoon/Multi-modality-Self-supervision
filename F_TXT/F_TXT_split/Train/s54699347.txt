The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The heart size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous and demonstrates diffuse mild mural calcifications. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Hilar contours are unchanged. There are minimal linear streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Evaluation of the lung apices is somewhat limited due to obscuration from the patient's chin. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
