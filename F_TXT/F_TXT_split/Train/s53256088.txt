AP chest compared to ___: The size of bilateral pneumothorax is underestimated on this supine view. It is moderate on the right, somewhat larger on the left, both stable since 2:56 a.m. after showing initial decrease on the right between 11:02 p.m. on ___:56 a.m. today, and possibly more substantial initial improvement following pleural decompression and the insertion of biapical, small bore pleural drains after detection of the pneumothorax on upright chest radiograph at 9:14 p.m. The distal portion of the right apical drain, projecting lateral to the chest cage, is extrathoracic. From a single frontal view one cannot ascertain whether any of the rest of the right cathether or the left catheter is appropriately positioned in the pleural space. ET tube and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard positions. Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall and neck is stable; subphrenic free air, pneumoretroperitoneum and/or pneumoperitoneum is also comparable in volume to 2?___ a.m. Heart size normal, increased slightly since ___:02 p.m. I discussed all of these findings, including my questions about the position of intended pleural drains, with Dr ___, by telephone, at 9:30 a.m. on ___.
