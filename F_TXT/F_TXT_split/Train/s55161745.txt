Right-sided Port-A-Cath and left PICC line remain in place. Interval removal of the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. There is increasing opacity throughout both lungs which likely represents superimposed pulmonary edema on a chronic airspace process which relatively spares a portion of the left lower lobe. Moderate right effusion. Mediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to patient positioning and obscuration by the airspace process. No pneumothorax.
