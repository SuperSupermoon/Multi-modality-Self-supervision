Single portable view of the chest. Endotracheal tube is seen with tip in approximately 5.8 cm from the carina. Right internal jugular line is seen with tip in the lower SVC. There are diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities and engorgement of the hila, suggestive of pulmonary edema noting that the ARDS or bilateral infection is also possible. Layering effusions also possible. More focal nodular opacity seen in the right mid lung is dense, potentially calcified and can be followed on future examinations. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
