A right-sided PICC line has been placed since the prior examination, terminating in the mid superior vena cava. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Opacification at the left lung base has improved somewhat, but suspected bilateral pleural effusions and patchy basilar opacities otherwise persist; although infection is difficult to exclude, the appearance is compatible with atelectasis.
