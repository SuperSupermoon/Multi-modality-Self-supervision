Comparison is made with prior study ___. The NG tube still is coiled at the hypopharynx but the tip is in the stomach. ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carina. Can be advanced a couple of centimeters for a more standard position. Right subclavian catheter tip is at the mid-to-lower SVC. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged within normal limits. Bibasilar opacities are grossly unchanged consistent with aspiration. There is mild vascular congestion.
