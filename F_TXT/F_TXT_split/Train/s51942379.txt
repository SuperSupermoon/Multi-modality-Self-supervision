Frontal view of the chest was obtained. Leads of a left-sided pacer terminate in the right atrium and ventricle. Moderate cardiomegaly with calcification of the aortic knob are stable. Hyperinflated lungs are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Interstitial lung markings are increased, consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac and right lung base opacities may represent a combination of atelectasis and effusion.
