There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube that extends up to the carina. An orogastric tube courses across the left hemidiaphragm into the stomach, its distal course not visualized. The lung volumes are low. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. A patchy right infrahilar opacity appears unchanged and may be due to minor atelectasis. However, in the left mid to lower lung, there is a vague but new suggested opacity.
