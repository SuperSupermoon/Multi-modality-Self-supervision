AP chest compared to 1:30 a.m.: Somewhat asymmetric pulmonary edema has improved in the perihilar regions since earlier in the day. Severe cardiomegaly and at least a small left pleural effusion persist. Conventional radiographs would be required to see if the pulmonary findings are more extensive than just edema.
