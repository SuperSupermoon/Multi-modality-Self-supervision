In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the nasogastric tube has been pulled back probably just distal to the esophagogastric junction. The side port lies above the esophagogastric junction and the tube should be pushed for forward at least 4 cm. Otherwise, little change other than the slightly lower lung volumes.
