Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, pulmonary edema has decreased in severity and bilateral pleural effusions have apparently decreased in size with residual moderate right and small left pleural effusions remaining with adjacent bibasilar atelectasis and or consolidation. No other relevant changes.
