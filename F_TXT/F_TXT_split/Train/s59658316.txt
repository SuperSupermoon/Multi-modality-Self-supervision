Right chest tube is in place. Substantial interval decrease in right pleural effusion is seen. No appreciable pneumothorax is present. Right basal consolidation might represent partial atelectatic right lower lung, re- expanding but right lower lung mass is another possibility. Followup with chest CT would be recommended. Left lung is essentially clear except for minimal left basal atelectasis.
