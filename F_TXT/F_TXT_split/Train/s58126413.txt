Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 5:00 p.m. Heart size is top normal. Right Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. There is substantial interval progression of left lung consolidation that given the rapidity of progression might represent a combination of atelectasis or reexpansion pulmonary edema and potentially reaccumulation at least in part of pleural fluid. Hemorrhage is less likely. Aspiration cannot be excluded, but should be clinically confirmed. Right basal opacity is unchanged. There is no interval development of pneumothorax.
