As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. As a consequence, small areas of atelectasis are seen at the right lung base and in the retrocardiac lung areas. The size of the cardiac silhouette appears slightly larger than before. No pleural effusion. Constant monitoring and support devices.
