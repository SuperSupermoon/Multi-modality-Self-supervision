AP portable upright view of the chest. Evaluation limited due to portable technique and leftward patient rotation. Dual lead pacemaker is again noted though the distal extent of the ventricular lead is not visualized. An azygous fissure is again seen. There are low lung volumes with basilar atelectasis noted. There is mild central hilar congestion without overt pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present. No large pneumothorax is seen.
