In comparison with the study of ___, there has been further decrease in the left pleural effusion and basilar atelectatic changes, with most of the hemidiaphragm well seen. Streak of atelectasis is seen at the right base with blunting of the costophrenic angle again noted. Little change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, but there is no evidence of acute pneumonia or pneumothorax.
