1. Feeding tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. Right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. The right pigtail catheter remains in place and there is a stable tiny right apical pneumothorax. The left pigtail catheter has been removed and there is a smaller left apical pneumothorax when compared to the previous study. There is increasing airspace consolidation in the lower lungs as well as in the lingula. These findings could reflect pulmonary edema, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. No large pleural effusions. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.
