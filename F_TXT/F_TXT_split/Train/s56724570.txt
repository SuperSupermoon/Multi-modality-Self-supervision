In comparison with the operative study, wedge resection has been performed and there is a small left apical pneumothorax with chest tube in place. Substantially lower lung volumes. Bibasilar opacifications probably reflect atelectasis and small effusions. Subcutaneous gas is seen along the left lateral chest wall and upper abdomen.
