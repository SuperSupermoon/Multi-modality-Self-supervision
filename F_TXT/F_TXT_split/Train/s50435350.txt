Compared with ___ and allowing for considerable differences in positioning, I doubt significant interval change. Suspect background hyperinflation/COPD. Again seen is marked cardiomegaly, vascular plethora and mild vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. Obscuration of both costophrenic angles is again present, suggestive of small bilateral effusions. Increased retrocardiac density and opacity at the right lung base likely represents a combination of collapse and/or consolidation and pleural effusions. Both hemidiaphragms are obscured. Right paratracheal/paramediastinal opacity is again seen, not fully characterized. Curvilinear opacity extending across the upper chest into both axillae is thought to represent artifact due to overlying soft tissues.
