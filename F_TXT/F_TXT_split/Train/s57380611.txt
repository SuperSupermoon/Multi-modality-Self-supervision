The course of both devices is unremarkable, there is no evidence of complication such as pneumothorax. In the interval, the left pleural effusion has remained constant. The left apical parenchymal opacities have mildly increased in extent and severity. On the right, the perihilar opacities have newly occurred in all lung regions. The opacities have a similar morphology than on the left, are alveolar in appearance and have ill-defined borders. Small air bronchograms are seen; altogether, these observations suggest pneumonia or aspiration. Unchanged appearance of the visible parts of the cardiac silhouette.
