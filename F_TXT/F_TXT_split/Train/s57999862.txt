1. Interval placement of two new left chest tubes status post recent thoracotomy with decrease in the opacification throughout the left lung and significantly improved aeration of most of the left lung. A left basilar chest tube remains in place. There is residual patchy opacity at the left base, which likely reflects residual atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. Residual small layering left effusion. The right lung remains grossly clear. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Endotracheal tube remains approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. A right PICC line remains in place with its tip in the distal SVC. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. No evidence of a pneumothorax.
