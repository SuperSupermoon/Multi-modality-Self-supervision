Rotated positioning. A left-sided battery pack obscures a portion of left heart border. 3 leads again noted. No pneumothorax detected. Again seen is increased retrocardiac density. This appears similar, but slightly more confluent and dense than on the prior study. The previously seen locule of air projecting over the cardiac silhouette is no longer visualized, the small air bronchograms remain visible. A small right effusion is similar to the prior study. Doubt overt CHF. Nodular pleural thickening again noted at the right lung apex.
