The tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 4 cm above the carina. Left subclavian catheter again extends into the azygos system. There are somewhat lower lung volumes. Increased opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Increased opacification is seen in the right cardiophrenic region. It is difficult to determine whether this is merely a manifestation of crowding of vessels related to poor inspiration. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
