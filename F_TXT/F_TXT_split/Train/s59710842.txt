Compared with the prior study, lines and tubes are similar in appearance. Left sided pacemaker with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as is the elevated left hemidiaphragm. There is atelectasis left lung base, possibly with a small effusion. There is minimal atelectasis the small effusion at the right lung base. Doubt CHF.
