Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema. Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
