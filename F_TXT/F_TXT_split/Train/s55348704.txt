Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates ET tube terminating 3.5 cm above the carina. The NG tube is positioned within the stomach. The lung volumes are low, which accentuate bronchovascular markings. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are prominent, which likely relate to technique and low lung volumes. The heart is mildly enlarged. Perihilar vascular congestion is noted. There is no pneumothorax. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
