A single AP radiograph of the chest was acquired. Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not significantly changed, allowing for differences in lung volume. There are bilateral perihilar-predominant reticular opacities as well as vascular cephalization and subtle Kerley B lines seen at the right lateral lung base, most consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Slightly more conspicious reticular opacities at the right lung base have been seen on several prior radiographs, including the study from ___, likely representing scarring/atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation. No definite pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. Vascular stents are seen within the left brachiocephalic vein, extending through the mid to lower SVC.
