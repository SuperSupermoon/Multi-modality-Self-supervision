Cardiomediastinal width has slightly decreased, likely due to decreased vascular distention. Minimal residual perihilar opacities persist, as well as improving more confluent area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region. Partially layering moderate left pleural effusion is likely unchanged allowing for technical differences between the studies.
