The ET tube terminates at the level of the clavicles. Right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. Nasogastric tube courses below the hemidiaphragm, tip not visualized. Moderate bilateral perihilar airspace opacities have increased. There are new small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. There is no pneumothorax. Increased retrocardiac airspace opacification is most likely due to atelectasis.
