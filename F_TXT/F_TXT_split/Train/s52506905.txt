AP radiograph of the chest has been obtained. The comparison with the prior study demonstrates improved position of the right PICC line, but it appears to be minimally looped potentially currently within the SVC (approximately 9 mm looping). If clinically warranted, further removal for additional 1 cm may be considered. The rest of the findings are unchanged.
