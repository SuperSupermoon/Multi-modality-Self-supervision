Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.8 cm above the level of the carina. There are low lung volumes. Patchy right upper lung opacity, somewhat streaky, may relate to underlying aspiration, atelectasis and/or infection. The left lung is clear. There is no large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are likely exaggerated by low lung volumes and supine, AP portable technique.
