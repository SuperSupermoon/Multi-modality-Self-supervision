Inspiratory volumes are low. Heart size is borderline or slightly enlarged. The pulmonary hila are both slightly prominent, similar to prior. There is a small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Mild vascular plethora may relate to low inspiratory volumes. Doubt overt CHF. Some patchy right infrahilar opacity most likely represents atelectasis. However, an early infiltrate or area of aspiration could have a similar appearance. There is possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle with atelectasis at the right lung base. No frank consolidation or gross effusion in the right lung
