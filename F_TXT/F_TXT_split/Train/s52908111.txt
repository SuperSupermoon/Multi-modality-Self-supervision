The lungs are clear. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Surgical clips are seen in the right upper quadrant. A focal hyperdensity just to the left of the lower thoracic spine is unchanged compared to multiple prior examinations and could reflect a bullet fragment.
