There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter with tip at the SVC/right atrial junction. No large pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. Endotracheal tube remains in similar position. As seen previously, the enteric tube should be advanced as this side port remains proximal to the gastroesophageal junction by at least 10 cm. Remainder of the examination is unchanged.
