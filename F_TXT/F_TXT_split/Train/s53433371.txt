The heart appears mildly enlarged. There are mild congestive changes bilaterally. There is somewhat more prominent opacity in the right lower lung than elsewhere but this is suspected to be due to low lung volumes and mild fluid overload with doubt concerning development of pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
