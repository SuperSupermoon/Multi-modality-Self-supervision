Lower lung volumes may explain some of the increase in generalized pulmonary radiodensity but I think mild pulmonary edema has worsened since ___. Severe left lower lobe atelectasis and moderate cardiomegaly are stable. Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusion is also stable. There is no pneumothorax.
