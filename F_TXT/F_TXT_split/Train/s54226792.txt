AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained four hours earlier during the same day. The remaining left-sided chest tube advanced from below has now been removed. The left lung remains well aerated without evidence of any pneumothorax or new parenchymal infiltrates. The lateral pleural sinuses are free from any significant fluid accumulation. Within the heart shadow, one can identify the metallic components of an aortic valve prosthesis in ordinary location.
