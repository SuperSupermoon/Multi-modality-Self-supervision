A single view AP chest view has been obtained with the patient in semi-upright position. There is considerable cardiac enlargement, although this may be exaggerated by the portable technique. No typical configurational abnormalities identified. Thoracic aorta of ordinary ___ but calcium deposits are present in the wall at the level of the arch. The pulmonary vasculature shows a mild degree of perivascular haze, but there is no evidence of interstitial alveolar edema. Large soft tissue structures are overlying the lung bases, but no gross pulmonary abnormalities can be identified and the lateral pleural sinuses appear free. Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for comparison.
