Left-sided chest tube remains in place. A vertically oriented linear opacity in the periphery of the left lower hemithorax is less distinct than on the prior radiograph and is not typical for pneumothorax. There may be a tiny apical pneumothorax present, unchanged. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Small right pleural effusion is present as well as adjacent right basilar atelectasis. Left retrocardiac atelectasis has partially cleared in the interval. No new or worsening lung abnormalities.
