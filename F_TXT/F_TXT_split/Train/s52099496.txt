CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 4.9 cm above the carina. A left subclavian PICC line is present. The tip is not optimally visualized. It can be traced to the mid mediastinum and ?to the mid SVC and is likely unchanged c/w ___. Compared with ___ at 7:59 a.m. and allowing for differences in technique, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. There is some patchy opacity at both lung bases, consistent with atelectasis, and minimal residual opacity in the right midzone. In the appropriate clinical setting, the differential diagnosis could include pneumonic infiltrate. No right effusion and no gross left effusion.
