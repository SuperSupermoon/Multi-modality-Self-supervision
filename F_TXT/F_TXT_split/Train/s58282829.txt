AP chest compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___, 5:___ a.m.: Left apical pneumothorax is tiny if any, apical pleural tube still in place. Left lower lobe consolidation has been present since at least ___, presumably atelectasis, there is new heterogeneous opacification in the left mid lung zone concerning for pneumonia. There has also been an increase in pulmonary vascular congestion since ___, indicating a relative cardiac dysfunction reflected in wider mediastinum due to engorged central veins. The loculated right pleural or extrapleural abnormality along the lateral chest wall may be slightly bigger, or exaggerated by lower lung volumes. Greater consolidation in the right lower lung zone and the new findings on the left could be either pneumonia or worsening atelectasis. Right pleural tube is unchanged in position crossing the right lower chest obliquely; a torso CT on ___ showed this was posterior to the lung in the pleural space, not fissural. Feeding tube ends in the stomach. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.
