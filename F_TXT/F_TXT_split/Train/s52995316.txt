An ET tube is present. The tip lies approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. An additional similar-appearing tube is present and overlies the upper mediastinum, slightly distal to the carina. Clinical correlation is requested --___ an additional tube been placed or does this represent tubing outside the patient? Left subclavian central line tip lies in the region of the cavoatrial junction, unchanged. No pneumothorax is detected. Rotated lordotic positioning and low inspiratory volumes. Allowing for this, the cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but probably similar prior. Again seen is opacity at the left base grossly similar to the prior film, a probable slightly improved. The extreme left costophrenic angle is obscured by an EKG lead. Possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Vascular plethora is noted, but could be accentuated by low lung volumes. Thin linear density at the right lung base is likely artifact rather than pneumothorax is vessels are seen projecting beyond it. On the right, there is atelectasis, but no definite consolidation.
