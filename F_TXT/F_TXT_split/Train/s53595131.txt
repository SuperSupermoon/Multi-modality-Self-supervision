Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. Lung volumes are slightly low. Heart size is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is mild crowding of bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
