Endotracheal tube tip terminates at the orifice of the right mainstem bronchus, and should be retracted by approximately 4 cm. Nasogastric tube tip courses below the diaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film. Left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis, with leftward shift of mediastinal structures noted. Infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures may be attributable to low lung volumes, though mild pulmonary vascular congestion is also likely present. Streaky right basilar atelectasis is also demonstrated. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is apparent. Multiple remote left-sided healed rib fractures are visualized.
