IN COMPARISON WITH THE STUDY OF ___, THERE HAS BEEN EXTENSIVE INCREASE IN SIZE IN THE PNEUMONIA INVOLVING THE RIGHT MID LUNG. PATCHY AREA OF INCREASED OPACIFICATION THAT COULD REPRESENT INFECTION IS ALSO SEEN AT THE LEFT BASE . THE CARDIAC SILHOUETTE IS MORE PROMINENT. THIS COULD REFLECT SOME CARDIAC DECOMPENSATION OR EVEN PERICARDIAL EFFUSION. THE HEMIDIAPHRAGMS ARE NOT AS SHARPLY SEEN, RAISING THE POSSIBILITY OF BILATERAL SMALL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS AND COMPRESSIVE BASILAR ATELECTASIS.
