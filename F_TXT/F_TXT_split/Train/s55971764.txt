AP portable upright view of the chest. Subcutaneous emphysema along the left chest wall is again noted. In this patient with recent stab wound, left pleural effusion likely represents hemothorax, small to moderate in volume with associated compressive lower lobe atelectasis. Right lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable though the left heart border is partially obscured. Bony structures are intact.
