Compared with ___ at 19:21 p.m. and allowing for differences in technique, no definite interval change is identified. Again seen is cardiomegaly with calcified aorta and tenting of the left hemidiaphragm. There is upper zone redistribution. There is mild diffuse prominence of interstitial markings - this is likely not changed, but accentuated by differences in technique, and may reflect chronic lung disease. Opacity at the right base laterally is also likely accentuated by differences in technique. No frank consolidation or gross effusion is identified.
