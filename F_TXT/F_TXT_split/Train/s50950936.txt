1. Right-sided Port-A-Cath remains in place. Interval removal of the left basilar pigtail catheter where there is residual patchy left basilar opacity which may reflect patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No large left effusion is seen. There is a slightly larger right pleural effusion with associated right basilar opacity suggestive of compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Gaseous distention of the stomach with some elevation of the left hemidiaphragm which is unchanged.
