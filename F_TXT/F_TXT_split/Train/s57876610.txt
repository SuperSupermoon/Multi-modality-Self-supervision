1. Interval insertion of a pigtail catheter into the right pleural cavity with decrease in size of the right pleural effusion. No large pneumothorax is seen. Improved aeration at the right base is consistent with resolving partial lower lobe atelectasis. Left lung remains grossly clear. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Right-sided Port-A-Cath continues to have its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are essentially stable.
