In comparison with the study of ___, there again are postsurgical changes in the left hemithorax with chest tube in place. The left apical region is difficult to assess, but no prominent pneumothorax is appreciated. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications are again seen. Although most likely representing pulmonary vascular congestion, in the appropriate clinical setting it would be difficult to exclude a superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
