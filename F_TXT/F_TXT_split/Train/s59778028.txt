1. A single-lead left-sided pacer remains in position. The heart remains enlarged, most likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded. Overall, there is increased haziness to the lungs, which would favor an element of superimposed interstitial edema, although there does not appear to be substantial peribronchial cuffing. There is likely a small left effusion. The retrocardiac area is not well visualized and therefore consolidation in this area cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. Evidence of a prior right-sided rotator cuff repair. Persistent superior subluxation of the right glenohumeral joint with narrowing of the acromiohumeral distance.
