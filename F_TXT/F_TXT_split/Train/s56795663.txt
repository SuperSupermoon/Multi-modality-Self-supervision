Comparison is made with prior study performed five hours earlier. Cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are stable. Bibasilar opacities, larger on the right side, have minimally increased on the right. There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions. Opacities in the lower lobes are worrisome for aspiration, mostly on the right, probably atelectasis on the left. There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. No other interval change from prior study.
