The patient is status post sternotomy. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is improvement in lung volumes with better aeration of the lung bases. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax although given technique small residual persistent pleural effusions would to be difficult to detect.
