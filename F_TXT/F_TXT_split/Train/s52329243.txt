Assessment is slightly limited due to patient positioning. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Widening of the superior mediastinum appears to be due to mediastinal lymphadenopathy as seen on the previous CTA of the neck. Bilateral hilar enlargement also may be due to underlying lymphadenopathy. Mild pulmonary edema is present. Additionally there are scattered ill-defined nodular opacities throughout the lungs diffusely. A trace left pleural effusion may be present, but no large right pleural effusion is seen, however the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized. Remote fracture of the right clavicle is present.
