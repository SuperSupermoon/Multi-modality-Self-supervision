Cardiomegaly is moderate and limits assessment of the retrocardiac lungs. Prominence of the upper mediastinum is likely a combination of unfolding of the aorta and projection. The hila are likely prominent with a tapered appearance raising the question of pulmonary hypertension. There is pulmonary edema, with vascular plethora I interstitial and possible areas of alveolar edema. More confluent opacity seen at the right lung base. There is also row increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Allowing for positioning, no gross effusions identified.
