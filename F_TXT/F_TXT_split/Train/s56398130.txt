Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day 2 hours earlier. The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of low SVC. The bibasal areas of atelectasis are noted, with no substantial change in the right lower lung and slight increase in atelectasis in the left lower lobe. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
