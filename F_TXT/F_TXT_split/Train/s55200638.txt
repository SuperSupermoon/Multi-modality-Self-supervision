Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the day before. ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carina. Thoracic hardware is in place. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Left chest tube is in place. There is minimal if no apical pneumothorax on the left. Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC. Right rib fractures are unchanged, but there is interval increase in right lower lobe opacity that might reflect aspiration or developing infection, attention to this area on the subsequent studies is recommended.
