Portable AP view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. Left costophrenic angle is obscured, suggestive of small left pleural effusion. Ill-defined opacity at the right lung base is new since prior. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are normal. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. Bilateral remote rib fractures are present.
