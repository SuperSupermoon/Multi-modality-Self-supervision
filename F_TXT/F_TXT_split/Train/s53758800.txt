Redemonstrated is a right IJ line, ETT, and NGT, all unchanged in position as compared to the prior examination from the same day. There is no convincing pleural line to suggest a pneumothorax. The lungs otherwise demonstrate unchanged bilateral airspace opacities, more severe on the left than the right. Small, bilateral pleural effusions are noted. No frank pulmonary edema is identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
