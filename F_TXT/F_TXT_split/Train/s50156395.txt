The ET tube, NG tube, and right IJ pacer wire are unchanged. There are bilateral pleural effusions and alveolar infiltrates that have increased compared to the study from the prior day. There is pulmonary vascular re-distribution and perihilar haze. The overlying impression is that of CHF. An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
