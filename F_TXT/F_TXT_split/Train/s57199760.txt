As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a Swan-Ganz catheter. The catheter needs to be pulled back given that the tip is projecting over distal parts of the right pulmonary artery. An opacity that pre-existed at the bases of the right upper lobe is no longer visible. However, the lung volumes have decreased and a small pleural effusion is unchanged at the right lung base. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. The right PICC line is constant in position.
