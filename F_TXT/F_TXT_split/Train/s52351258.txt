New heterogeneous opacification left lung base could be early pneumonia or atelectasis. Right lung clear. No definite pleural abnormality, but lateral radiograph would be helpful in assessing possible pleural effusion as well as the integrity of the thoracic spine. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
