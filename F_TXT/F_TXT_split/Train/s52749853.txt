Single lead left-sided pacer is unchanged position. Interval placement of a right internal jugular dual bore catheter with its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Worsening pulmonary and interstitial edema. Bibasilar pleural effusions with associated opacity suggestive of compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning.
