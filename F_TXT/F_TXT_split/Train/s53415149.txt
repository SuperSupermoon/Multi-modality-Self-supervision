Large retrocardiac lucency is seen which may be due to a large hiatal hernia with adjacent right base atelectasis. Left basilar opacity is seen which is worrisome for pneumonia. The right base opacities may be due to atelectasis, although additional site of infection is not excluded. There is also likely pulmonary edema. Blunting of the costophrenic angles is seen and there may be pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The bones are diffusely osteopenic.
