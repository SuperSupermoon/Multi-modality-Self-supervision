A portable frontal expiratory chest radiograph again demonstrates a left apically directed chest tube in place. The small left apical pneumothorax is decreased in size, but persistent. Left rib fractures are unchanged. Lung volumes are lower, with increasing bibasilar opacities likely reflecting increased atelectasis. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
