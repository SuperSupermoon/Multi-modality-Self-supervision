AP chest compared to ___. There has been no appreciable interval change, moderate left, large right pleural effusion, moderately severe pulmonary edema and greater consolidation in the right lung are all stable. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has worsened slightly. Mediastinal veins are still engorged: Endotracheal tube has been repositioned from the carina to the thoracic inlet, in standard position. Right subclavian or PIC line ends in the mid SVC and an upper enteric tube passes into the stomach but may loop into the distal esophagus. Subsequent chest radiograph showed the loop entirely in the stomach.
