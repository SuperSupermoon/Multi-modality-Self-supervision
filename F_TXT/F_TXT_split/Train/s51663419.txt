Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. Previous mild pulmonary edema, vascular congestion and small pleural effusions have improved reflecting decreasing cardiac decompensation. Chronic moderate cardiomegaly with a configuration suggesting particular left atrial enlargement, is unchanged. There may be new small region of opacification in the axillary areas of both upper lungs. I would recommend repeat upright chest radiographs with overlying devices removed, in order to look for evidence of pneumonia. This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. .
