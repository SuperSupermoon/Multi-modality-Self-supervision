Diffuse bilateral airspace disease, similar to earlier the same day, though some interval increase in the opacity at the right base laterally appears to be present. As suggested on the recently obtained chest CT, this appears to represent an combination of background pulmonary nodules with new superimposed parenchymal opacities, raising the question of multifocal pneumonia or diffuse aspiration. In the appropriate clinical setting, hemorrhage might also account for this appearance. The CT also suggested an element of pulmonary edema. Lines and tubes as described. The right IJ central line tip overlies the upper right atrium. If clinically indicated, this could be retracted by approximately 1.5 cm. No pneumothorax detected.
