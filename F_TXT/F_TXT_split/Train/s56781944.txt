Endotracheal tube terminates 4.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with perihilar haziness. Left basilar patchy opacity is noted, worrisome for aspiration. Similar but much smaller opacity is also noted within the right lung base. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Calcifications within the upper abdomen bilaterally correlate with staghorn calculi seen on CT.
