There is placement of the left internal jugular central venous line with tip at the caval atrial junction. The remaining lines and tubes are unchanged in position. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Diffuse parenchymal opacities are again noted bilaterally. The heart is also likely enlarged. The differential is broad but the findings may be secondary to pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, aspiration, or infection.
