As compared to ___ chest radiograph, there has been little change in the appearance of the chest except for slight decrease in extent of consolidation in the right supra hilar region. Other multifocal heterogeneous opacities are similar to the recent radiograph. Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with slight decrease in right apical pneumothorax, now very small in size.
