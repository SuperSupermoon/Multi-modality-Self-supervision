As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing parenchymal opacity at the right lung base has minimally increased in severity. A right pleural effusion of mild-to-moderate extent persists. The vertebral stabilization devices are in unchanged position. Also, persistent, is the near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax. No other changes.
