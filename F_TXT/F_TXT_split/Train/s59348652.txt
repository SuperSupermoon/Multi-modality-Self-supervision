Lung volumes have improved, particularly the right lower lobe, now almost clear, where one can see a small posteriorly layering pleural effusion. Elevation of the left lung base is still pronounced despite positive pressure ventilator support. ET tube in standard placement. Consolidation in the apical region of the left upper lobe is improving, revealing the large central mediastinal mass in the aortopulmonic window. Left pneumothorax and pleural effusion are small if any. Heart size normal.
