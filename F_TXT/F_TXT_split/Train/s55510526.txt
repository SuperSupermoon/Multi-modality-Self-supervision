The chin overlies the right apex and upper mediastinum significantly limiting evaluation. Lung volumes are low. Yhe right hemidiaphragm is poorly visualized due to right basilar opacities, likely a combination of atelectasis and small pleural effusion. Atelectasis is also noted in the left lung base. The cardiac silhouette is poorly visualized and evaluated due to the low lung volumes. The mediastinum is not significantly changed since the next most recent radiograph. There is mild prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature without evidence of frank pulmonary edema. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. There is no evidence of a large pneumothorax.
