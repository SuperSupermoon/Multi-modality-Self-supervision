There is improved aeration in the left upper lobe and in the right lung. Opacification of the left lower lobe with obscuration of the diaphragm is consistent with persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. The mediastinum is no longer shifted to the left consistent with improved volume loss in the upper lobe. There are no definite pleural effusions. There is a left central venous catheter which is kinked on introduction to the chest.
