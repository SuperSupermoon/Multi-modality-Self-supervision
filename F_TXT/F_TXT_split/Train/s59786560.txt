Portable supine AP chest radiograph was provided. The AICD noted with leads extending into the region of the right atrium and right ventricle. The heart appears enlarged though better assessed on same-day chest CT. Lower lung opacities are also better assessed on same-day chest CT given the low lung volumes on this chest radiograph. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 5.7 cm above the carina. The NG tube extends into the mid esophagus - advancement is recommended for more optimal positioning. Otherwise, no change from prior.
