Trauma board obscures detail. Lung volumes are markedly low. The patient is rotated, which likely accounts for the apparent mediastinal widening, but this can be further evaluated on followup imaging. The heart is likely upper limits of normal in size. No focal airspace consolidation is appreciated. No large effusions. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. No displaced rib fracture is appreciated. However, if this is of clinical concern, a dedicated rib series may be helpful.
