Mild pulmonary edema moderate right pleural effusion and bibasilar consolidation, most likely atelectasis, developed over the preceding to days. Moderate right pleural effusion has increased, and although the bibasilar consolidation is unchanged, there is new left perihilar consolidation. It would be very helpful to obtain an upright radiograph to determine if pulmonary edema is present and whether there may be new pneumonia in the left lung. Top-normal heart size unchanged. ET tube tip is less than a cm from the carina, with the chin in neutral position, an should be withdrawn 3 cm to avoid inadvertent unilateral intubation. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right jugular line ends near the superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
