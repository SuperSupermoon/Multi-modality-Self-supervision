The patient has been extubated. A right internal jugular venous catheter terminates in the mid superior vena cava. There are two mediastinal drains as well as a left-sided chest tube in unchanged positions. A percutaneous pacing wire is also noted.Streaky opacities suggest minimally atelectasis at the lung bases, but the lungs are mostly clear. The appearance of a possible air-fluid level over the mid right chest does not persist on follow-up radiography.
