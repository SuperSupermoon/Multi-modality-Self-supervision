Support and monitoring devices are in standard position except for a left PICC with a relatively low position in the proximal right atrium. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for lower lung volumes on the current study, and note is made of removal of endotracheal tube. Worsening patchy bibasilar opacities probably represent atelectasis, but coexisting aspiration is possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Lungs are otherwise clear except for a small calcified granuloma at the right apex.
