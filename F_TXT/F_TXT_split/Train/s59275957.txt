Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance since the recent radiograph. Interstitial opacities in both lungs have worsened in the interval, and may reflect worsening interstitial edema. Superimposed more heterogeneous opacities throughout the right lung have also worsened, and could represent either asymmetrical edema or a superimposed process such as infectious pneumonia. Cystic lucencies at right lung apex, which have been better characterized on recent CT, are accompanied by apparent apical scarring, although an infection in this region such as a mycobacterial infection is an additional consideration, and direct comparison to more remote chest radiographs would be helpful to exclude this possibility.
