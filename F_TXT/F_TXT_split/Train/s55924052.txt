Single portable view of the chest. Relatively low lung volumes are seen with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings. Bibasilar opacities, more conspicuous than the left may be due to secondary atelectasis. Known oblong density at the right lung base is again seen and is partially covered by overlying lead and is therefore difficult to assess for interval change. The cardiomediastinal silhouette has not definitely changed. Left chest wall dual-lead pacing device is seen, similar compared to ___.
