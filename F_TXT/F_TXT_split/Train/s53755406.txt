There is increased opacity within the right upper to mid lung laterally, new from prior examination. Findings may reflect developing infection but are non-specific. The remainder of the lungs appear clear. There is no overt interstitial edema. No large pleural effusions are evident. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. An AICD generator and single lead appear in expected unchanged position terminating in the region of the right ventricle. Numerous mediastinal clips from prior CABG are noted.
