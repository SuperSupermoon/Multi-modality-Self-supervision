In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung volumes. The left chest tube remains in place and there is no definite pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube again extends into the stomach. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and small pleural effusion. Dense streak of atelectasis is again seen in the left lower zone. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Dilatation of the colon in the region of the splenic flexure is again seen.
