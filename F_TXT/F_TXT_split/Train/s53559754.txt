In comparison with study of ___, there is now a right Pleurx catheter in place with decrease in the degree of effusion and no definite pneumothorax. There is, however, substantial subcutaneous gas along the right lateral chest wall. Some opacification at the right base could reflect residual atelectasis, though supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. On the left, there has been an increase in the pleural effusion. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
