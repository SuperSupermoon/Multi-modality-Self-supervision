There is persistent visualization of a large left pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. No right-sided pleural effusion seen. A right-sided internal jugular Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax. A fracture/osteotomy of the left clavicle is again noted. The left humerus is been resected.
