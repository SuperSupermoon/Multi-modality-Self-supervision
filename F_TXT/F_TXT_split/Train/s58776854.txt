Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings, particularly at the lung bases. Subtle bibasilar opacities are seen, which could relate to prominent bronchovascular markings and low lung volumes. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, early consolidation due to infection and/or aspiration is not excluded. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
