The patient is status post sternotomy. There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly. Compared with the prior film, there is new CHF, with upper zone redistribution, thickening of the minor fissure, and diffuse vascular blurring. More patchy opacity at the right cardiophrenic region could reflect vascular plethora and atelectasis, but the possibility of an early infiltrate cannot be excluded. Otherwise, no consolidation. No gross effusions.
