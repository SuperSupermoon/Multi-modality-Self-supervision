Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. A dual-lead pacer is unchanged with leads extending to the region of the right atrium and right ventricle. There are no definite signs of pneumonia or CHF. Subtle hazy opacity in the left lung could reflect mild leftward patient rotation. Cardiomediastinal contour is stable with atherosclerotic calcifications along the somewhat unfolded thoracic aorta. The heart remains mildly enlarged. The bony structures are intact.
