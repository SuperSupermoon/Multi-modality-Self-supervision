In comparison with the study of ___, the right apical chest tube remains in place and there is no convincing evidence of pneumothorax. Continued low lung volumes may account for some of the prominence of the cardiac silhouette. Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis persist. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels again raises the possibility of increased pulmonary venous pressure.
