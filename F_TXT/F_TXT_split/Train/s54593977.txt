There is no significant change compared to ___ with re-demonstration of enlarged cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Hilar contours are unremarkable. Again identified are left greater than right bibasilar opacities with blunting of the diaphragmatic contour suggestive of bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar consolidation. There is no pneumothorax.
