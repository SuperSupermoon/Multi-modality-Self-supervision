Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. There is likely bibasilar atelectasis given the low lung volumes, although underlying aspiration is not entirely excluded. Consider repeat PA and lateral views with improved inspiratory effort when the patient is able for better assessment of the lung bases. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
