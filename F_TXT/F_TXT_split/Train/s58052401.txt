AP chest radiograph was obtained. New opacification is seen predominantly in the right upper lobe; however, on this single view involvement of the middle or lower lobes would be difficult to exclude. Port-A-Cath is seen in place. Left lung is relatively clear. Small right pleural effusion is seen. The heart is normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal contours.
