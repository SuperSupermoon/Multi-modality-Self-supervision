The current image shows, better than the previous radiograph from 3:12 p.m., a relatively large left apical pneumothorax. The pneumothorax appears to have increased. The collapsed left lung is difficult to differentiate against the left aspects of the cardiac silhouette and the obviously present pleural fluid collection that had newly appeared since this morning, but is not substantially changed as compared to 3:12 p.m. The appearance of the multiple displaced rib fractures is constant. CT would be helpful in differentiating between collapsed left lung and potentially hemorrhagic pleural effusion, and to reliably determined the true extent of the left pneumothorax. Unchanged appearance of the right lung.
