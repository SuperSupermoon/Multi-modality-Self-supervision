AP chest compared to ___: Tip of the intraaortic balloon pump is slightly above midpoint between the upper margin of the left main bronchus and the apex of the aortic knob, no more than 28 mm away. Judging from the appearance of the right lung, previous mild pulmonary edema has improved if not cleared. The large area of batwing-like opacification projecting about both pulmonary hila could be due largely if not exclusively to pleural effusion. Lateral view would be helpful in making that determination. Lateral component of pleural effusion at the base of the left hemithorax is new. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal vasculature is not particularly engorged. No pneumothorax.
