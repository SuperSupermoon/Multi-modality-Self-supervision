In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. The hazy opacification in the right hemithorax is less prominent, suggesting some improvement in the pleural effusion or a more erect position of the patient. There is increased opacification at the right base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with atelectasis or possible supervening pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. The left hemidiaphragm is now sharply seen, consistent with some clearing of atelectasis at the left base. Streak basilar atelectasis persists on this side.
