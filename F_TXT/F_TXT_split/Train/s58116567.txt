Single portable upright frontal image of the chest. There has been interval placement of a left-sided pigtail chest tube. With partial re-expansion of the lung. Increased opacity in the left lower lung and to a lesser extent the left upper lung may represent re-expansion edema. No pleural reflection is clearly seen, suggesting significant re-expansion. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.
