Moderate right pleural effusion has Re accumulated substantially since ___. I cannot tell whether drainage catheter is still in the pleural space. Heart is enlarged though partially obscured and difficult to judge. Small region of consolidation in the left midlung should be followed for possible pneumonia and there is still substantial consolidation at the base of the previously collapsed right lung. No pneumothorax.
