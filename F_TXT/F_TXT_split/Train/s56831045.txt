Single portable view of the chest demonstrates opacification of most of the right hemithorax with interval increase in right-sided pleural effusion, now quite large, which has significantly increased in size over the course of 10 days, and may be partially loculated. The left lung is essentially clear. Cardiac size remains stable as does the left hilar contour. There is no left pleural effusion.
