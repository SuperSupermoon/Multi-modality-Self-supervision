AP chest compared to ___, 8:16 p.m.: I do not see radiopaque feeding tube in the chest. Mild cardiomegaly is stable, exaggerated by supine positioning which may account for upper lobe vascular engorgement on the left. Left subclavian infusion port ends in the upper right atrium. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
