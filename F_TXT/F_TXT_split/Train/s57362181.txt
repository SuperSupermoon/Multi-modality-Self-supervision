Allowing for differences in modality, a moderate-sized left pleural effusion is improved since prior CT examination. Platelike atelectasis is noted at the left upper lobe. Known left perihilar mass and associated atelectasis is better assessed on prior CT examination. Note is also made of retrocardiac atelectasis. The right lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax.
