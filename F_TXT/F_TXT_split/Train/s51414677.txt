Dobbhoff tube is present and mild minimally coiled within the stomach, terminating in the gastric fundus. An endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina. A right and left central line are unchanged within the mid to distal superior vena cava. There is persistent left lower lobe collapse. A presumed small left pleural effusion is unchanged. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and the mediastinal contours are unchanged. Dense mitral annular calcifications are appreciated. There is a paucity of air within the imaged upper abdomen. There is no free air on this semi erect study.
