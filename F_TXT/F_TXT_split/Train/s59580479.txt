A portable semi-upright chest radiograph shows patchy airspace consolidation bilaterally with apparently more involvement in the right lung than was seen on yesterday's exam. Central pulmonary vasculature does not appear engorged on the current study and cardiac size is within normal limits, suggesting these may be related to pneumonia, possibly aspiration pneumonia in this intubated patient. Tip of the endotracheal tube, position of right-sided central venous catheter and nasogastric tube are unchanged.
