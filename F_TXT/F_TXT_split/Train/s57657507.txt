AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The exam is suboptimal due to patient rotation and patient's chin overlies the right apex. There are low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Given this, the pulmonary vasculature appears mildly prominent, which could be due to pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy left base opacity could represent a vascular structure, although an infectious process or aspiration is not excluded. A single-lead left-sided pacer is seen with the distal aspect of the lead not well seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are not fully evaluated.
