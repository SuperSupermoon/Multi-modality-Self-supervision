As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received two left-sided chest tubes. No pneumothorax can be detected. The extent of the left effusion has markedly decreased, however, there is a small amount of remnant pleural effusion, associated moderate degree of left basal and retrocardiac atelectasis. Relatively extensive soft tissue air collections in the left lateral chest wall and cervical soft tissues. Small right lung volumes with crowding of the vascular structures but without evidence of overt pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
