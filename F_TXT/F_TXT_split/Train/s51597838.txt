Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 4.2 cm above the carina, left PICC terminates in the lower superior vena cava, and a nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by heterogeneous opacities in the mid and lower lung regions, which are superimposed upon known basilar predominant interstitial fibrosis. Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary edema, diffuse infection, ARDS, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
