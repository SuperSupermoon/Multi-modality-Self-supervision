Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. Severe cardiac enlargement has improved minimally. Moderate edema in the right lung is stable and there has been no change in the more densely consolidated left lung. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. Upright and/or lateral projections would be necessary to assess the volume of pleural fluid and the presence of atelectasis, which could be particularly severe in the left lower lobe. Cardiopulmonary support devices are unchanged in standard positions. No pneumothorax.
