Interval placement of stent in the region of the bronchus intermedius, with no evidence of postprocedural pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Large mass in the right juxta hilar region has been more fully characterized by a recent CT and is contiguous with extensive lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum. Poorly defined opacities in the right mid and lower lung could reflect a combination of atelectasis and aspiration although developing infectious pneumonia should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Small right pleural effusion is also demonstrated. Note is made of new moderate gastric distension.
