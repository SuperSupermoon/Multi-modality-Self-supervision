Mild pulmonary edema has improved since earlier in the day. Bibasilar consolidation preceded the edema edema, due to atelectasis or pneumonia. Small pleural effusions are presumed. The heart is normal size and there is no mediastinal or pulmonary vascular engorgement. ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements, and a nasogastric tube ends in a nondistended stomach. No pneumothorax. In reviewing the of chest CT scan performed elsewhere on ___ I can see persistent fluid distension of the esophagus. That suggests this patient has at high risk for aspiration. It should also be noted that bibasilar consolidation at that time was more typical of atelectasis than pneumonia.
