As compared to recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema are new. Patchy and linear right lower lobe opacities are also new and favor atelectasis considering the presence of mild volume loss. Coexisting aspiration or an early focus of infectious pneumonia is also possible. Note is also made of air-filled distension of the thoracic esophagus suggesting esophageal dysmotility.
