In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter is been pulled back to the mid to lower SVC. There is now an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. The patient has taken a slightly better inspiration. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There may be mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, substantially improved since the previous study. Bibasilar opacities at the bases are consistent with small effusions and atelectatic changes.
