The endotracheal tube is seen to course into the right main bronchus, and there is a moderate-to-large right pneumothorax causing a partial collapse of right lung and some element of tension in the form of mild mediastinal shift to the left side. Increased opacity in the left lung is due to the poor aeration from selective intubation of the right bronchus. Heart size is top normal.
