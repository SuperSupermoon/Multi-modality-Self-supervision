Lung volumes are persistently low. The cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contour is stable with unfolding of the thoracic aorta. Since the prior study, there is new mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally suggests small bilateral pleural effusions. Retrocardiac opacity also appears progressed, and could reflect an area of worsening atelectasis though infection cannot be completely excluded. Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm persists. No pneumothorax is identified.
