The lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes most pronounced in the lung apices. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size appearing mildly enlarged. Enlargement of pulmonary arteries is re- demonstrated, compatible with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. No pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Bibasilar airspace opacities have progressed compared to the previous radiograph. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Posterior thoracic fusion hardware is re- demonstrated along with multiple surgical ___ along the midline.
