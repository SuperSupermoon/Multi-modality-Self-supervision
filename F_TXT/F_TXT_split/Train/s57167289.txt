Lung volumes are mildly diminished, but unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Pulmonary vasculature is minimally engorged in the upper lobes but the patient was supine for imaging so this was probably normal. There is no pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion. Slight leftward deviation of the cervical trachea is not due to thyroid enlargement, confirmed by recent its neck CT.
