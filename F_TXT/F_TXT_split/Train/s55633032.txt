There are no old chest x-rays available for comparison. The heart is moderately enlarged. There is a moderate left effusion and a small right effusion. There is ill-defined hazy vasculature with mild pulmonary vascular re-distribution compatible with CHF. There is dense retrocardiac opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. There is left-sided PICC line with tip in the SVC. Deformity of the right humeral head is again visualized.
