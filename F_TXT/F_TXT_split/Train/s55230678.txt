As compared to the prior CT examination, a loculated right pleural effusion has essentially been drained. There are two new right-sided chest tubes, which enter the same level with one positioned inferiorly and one continuing superiorly. There is now a new trace right apical pneumothorax. Lung volumes remain low with no new focal consolidation. A right subclavian catheter is unchanged with tip in the right atrium. A nasogastric tube is normal in course with tip in the stomach and side port near the gastroesophageal junction. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
