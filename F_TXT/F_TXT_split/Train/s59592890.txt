Single upright AP portable view of the chest was provided. There is a subtle poorly defined opacity projecting in the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure which projects over the inferior blade of the scapula and likely represents an early focus of pneumonia. There is also subtle opacity in the left lung base which possibly may represent a second focus of pneumonia. No large pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. Bony structures appear intact.
