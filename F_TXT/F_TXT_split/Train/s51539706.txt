In comparison with the study of ___, there is now an endotracheal tube in place with the tip approximately 4.8 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube and right central catheter remain in place. Continued hazy opacification of the right hemithorax consistent with pleural effusion with engorgement of ill-defined pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Areas of atelectasis are seen at both bases. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
