Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Bibasal consolidations appear to be grossly similar to previous examination. Upper zone opacities are similar as well. Right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Overall the similarity of the findings as compared to the previous study would suggest infectious etiology as well as more peripheral distribution of the findings as compared to most central appearance and pulmonary edema. Aspiration is a possibility although involvement of the upper zones as well as lower zones of the lungs would be in favor of fungal infection as previously suggested based on multiple previous examinations. When compared to ___, minimal change is demonstrated in the overall involvement of the lungs.
