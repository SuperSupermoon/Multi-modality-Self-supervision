1. There is worsening airspace disease within the right lung as well as increasing airspace disease within the left lung. These findings either reflect a worsening bilateral pneumonia or possibly pulmonary edema, although the vasculature on the previous study was entirely normal in appearance. Clinical correlation is advised. There is persistent opacity at the left base also suggestive of an effusion with associated lower lobe atelectasis. Lung volumes remain markedly diminished. No right effusion is seen. No pneumothorax.
