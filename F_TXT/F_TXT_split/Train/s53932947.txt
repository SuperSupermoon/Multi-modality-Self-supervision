The moderate right pleural effusion has continued to decrease compared with the immediate prior study from earlier on the same date, and is now small with moderate associated atelectasis. A small portion of the PleurX catheter is visible projecting over the right heart border, but the catheter course cannot be traced from the chest wall. Abdominal radiography will be better able to evaluate the catheter course. A right chest wall port catheter tip ends in the right atrium. There is no pneumothorax. There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. Heart size is top-normal.
