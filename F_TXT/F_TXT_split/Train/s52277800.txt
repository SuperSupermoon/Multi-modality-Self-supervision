As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are constant. The lung volumes have decreased. Moderate cardiomegaly with relatively extensive bilateral areas of atelectasis. The diffuse increase in radiodensity of the lung parenchyma and the presence of small pleural effusions as well as the increase in vascular diameter suggests mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. No other abnormalities.
