AP chest compared to 3:56 p.m. on ___: Widespread pulmonary opacification has worsened, particularly in the lower lungs, but the pattern is still consistent with progressive pulmonary edema. Obliteration of the right diaphragmatic pleural contour is a function of the greater edema and possible increasing pleural effusion at the right base. The left internal jugular line can be traced nearly 6 cm inferior to the lower margin of the left clavicle, a course that is equivocal as to anatomic location. It could be in an inferiorly positioned left brachiocephalic vein, intra-arterial, in the aorta, in a small mediastinal vein, or extravascular. The anatomic possibilities can be narrowed by measuring blood gases and pressure in the line. A right supraclavicular central venous infusion port passes into the right heart, where the tip is probably in the right ventricle. No pneumothorax. Heart size is difficult to assess, probably moderately increased. Mediastinal caliber is within normal limits and unchanged. Findings were discussed with the ICU care team at the time of dictation.
