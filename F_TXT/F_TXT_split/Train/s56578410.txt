In comparison with the study of ___, the degree of pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium has decreased, though abnormal air collections persist. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications are essentially unchanged in this patient with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. This appearance could well reflect patchy areas of consolidation with superimposed pulmonary vascular congestion. The right subclavian PICC line is difficult to assess, though it probably extends to the upper to mid portion of the SVC.
