Patient is status post left upper lobectomy. Opacity in the left apex is of unclear etiology. There is no basal effusion or pneumothorax. There is no consolidation in the right lung. The cardiomediastinum is shifted to the left due to lobectomy. The left hemidiaphragm is not seen. Retrocardiac opacities are likely due to atelectasis. Imaged osseous structures are intact.
