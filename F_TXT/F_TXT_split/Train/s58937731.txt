Lung volumes are low. Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Bibasilar airspace opacities are worse compared to the previous chest radiograph, and the left basilar opacity appears to be new compared to the previous CT. A small left pleural effusion may be present. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Previously demonstrated ill-defined nodular opacities in the right upper lobe on CT are likely still present on the current radiograph. Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is re- demonstrated. Degenerative changes of both shoulders are again noted along with narrowed acromial humeral intervals suggestive of rotator cuff disease.
