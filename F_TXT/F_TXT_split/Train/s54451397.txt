A new right pleural catheter is noted. There has been an interval decrease in the size of the right pleural effusion. A right basilar opacity likely represents atelectasis or mild re-expansion edema. No definite pneumothorax is identified. The patient's neck overlies portion of the right lung apex. Otherwise, appearances are similar to the prior film, with possible slight interval increase in previously seen opacity at the left lung base. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly enlarged, but unchanged and remains midline. No CHF. Stent noted over right upper quadrant.
