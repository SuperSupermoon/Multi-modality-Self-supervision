A left PICC is again demonstrated, however the catheter is not seen beyond the level of the brachiocephalic, obscured by overlying soft tissues. There has been interval removal of a left internal jugular central venous catheter and NGT, and the patient is now extubated. There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural effusion. A benign-appearing subcentimeter sclerotic lesion within the proximal right humerus is again demonstrated.
