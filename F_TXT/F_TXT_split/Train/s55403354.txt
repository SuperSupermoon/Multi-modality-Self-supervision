Cardiac silhouette size appears borderline enlarged. Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is again noted with atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic knob. Convexity at the AP window and left superior mediastinal contour likely reflects known mediastinal lymphadenopathy, better assessed on the previous CT. Lungs are hyperinflated with attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings and bullous changes in the right lung base compatible with emphysema. There has been interval development of a moderate size left pleural effusion. Left basilar opacification may reflect compressive atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded. Known lung nodules are better assessed on previous CT. No acute osseous abnormality is demonstrated.
