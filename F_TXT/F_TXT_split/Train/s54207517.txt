A nasogastric tube enters the stomach, its distal course not imaged beyond the gastric cardia. A left-sided PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Small-to-moderate layering pleural effusions are suspected. A mild interstitial abnormality suggests pulmonary congestion, but similar to perhaps somewhat improved. Right apical pleural thickening is stable and persistent relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm reflects postsurgical volume loss.
