The ETT, left subclavian line, and very dense foreign body which is presumed to with a filling have unchanged appearance. The NGtube is no longer seen. There is dense retrocardiac opacity consistent with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. There is also volume loss in the right lower lobe. Compared to the prior study tharupper lungs are clear. degenerative changes in the right humeral head are visualized.
