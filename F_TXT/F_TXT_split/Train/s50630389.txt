AP view of the chest was obtained. There is a single lead left-sided AICD with lead in the expected position of the right ventricle, unchanged. The cardiac silhouette is moderately moderately enlarged, appears increased in size since the prior study, may in part relate to technique. There is no overt pulmonary edema. Previously noted medial right base opacity is still seen, but less apparent than on the prior study and most likely relates to vascular structures. Findings could be better evaluated with PA and lateral views if patient able. No new focal consolidation is seen. There is no evidence of large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
