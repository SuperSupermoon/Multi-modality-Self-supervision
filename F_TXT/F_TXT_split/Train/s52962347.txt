Patient rotated somewhat to the left. There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, as somewhat low in position, terminating 1 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. There increased bibasilar opacities worrisome for bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right seen overlying atelectasis. Underlying aspiration is not excluded. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
