In comparison with the study of ___, there again are relatively low lung volumes that accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. There may be minimal elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. No definite acute focal pneumonia, though this would be difficult to exclude in the absence of a lateral view to assess the retrocardiac region. No evidence of pleural effusion.
