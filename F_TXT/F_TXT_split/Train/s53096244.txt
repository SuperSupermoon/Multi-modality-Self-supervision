Right IJ sheath overlies the mid SVC. The patient is status post sternotomy, with prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There are diffuse increased interstitial markings -- some of this is probably vascular, reflecting CHF, but the possibility of underlying interstitial changes cannot be excluded. The right hemidiaphragm is slightly better defined. No gross effusion is identified. No pneumothorax is detected. Stool noted in descending colon.
