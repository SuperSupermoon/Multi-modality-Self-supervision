The ET and NG tubes have been removed. Again seen is a right-sided chest tube, similar in position. No obvious pneumothorax detected allowing, for lordotic positioning. Compared to the prior study, there does appear to be more extensive opacification of the right mid zone, in addition to the previous seen right base opacity. Air bronchograms are seen and the right hemidiaphragm is obscured. This likely represents combination of collapse and/or consolidation involving the right mid and lower zones. In addition, there is interval increase in opacity in the left mid and lower zones, with new obscuration of the left left hemidiaphragm and new opacity in the lung in the infrahilar region. Presence of bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded. There is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular plethora slightly increased, suggesting some interval increase in CHF. The previously seen right lower chest posterior rib fracture is obscured of the lung opacities.
