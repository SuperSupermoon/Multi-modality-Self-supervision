Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis are likely unchanged, allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.
