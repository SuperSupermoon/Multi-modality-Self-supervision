Overlying external artifact partially obscures the view. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.9 cm above the level the carina. No focal consolidation is seen. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable. Old posterior left-sided rib fracture was better seen on prior study, an external lead likely overlies it on the current study. Right upper quadrant surgical clips are incidentally noted.
