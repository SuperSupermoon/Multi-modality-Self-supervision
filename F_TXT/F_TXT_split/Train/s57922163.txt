The ET tube continues to be slightly high, at the thoracic inlet. NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach. There continue to be low lung volumes with pulmonary vascular re-distribution. There are new/increased opacities in both lower lungs. While this could be due to volume loss, early infiltrate cannot be excluded.
