Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. There is persistent increased opacification of the bilateral bases, right greater than left, consistent with pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis. The known left apical hydro-pneumothorax is unchanged in appearance over the interval. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are also unchanged. Increased vascular congestion is concerning for pulmonary edema. There are two hyperdense stripes is seen projecting over the trachea, one likely corresponds the endotracheal tube. The other is of unclear origin. The assumed endotracheal tube ends 3 cm from the carina. There is no pneumothorax.
