Lung volumes somewhat low, as before. There is streaky density in the left and at the right base consistent with subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. The heart appears enlarged. The patient is status post median sternotomy. Mediastinal structures are stable. A right internal jugular catheter remains in place. Allowing for differences in technique, there is no significant change.
