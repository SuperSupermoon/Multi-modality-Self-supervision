AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. The heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged since the prior study. There is interval development of right mid lung opacity that most likely represents area of atelectasis. Right upper lobe parenchymal opacity might reflect contusion. No appreciable pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax present. Of note, this is the portable supine radiograph that provides very limited assessment for pneumothorax.
