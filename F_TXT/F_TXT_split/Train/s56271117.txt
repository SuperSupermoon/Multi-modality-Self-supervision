A single AP radiograph of the chest was acquired. A right PICC ends in the low SVC, not significantly changed compared to the prior radiograph from ___, although this PICC has apparently been exchanged in the interim. There is minimal bilateral lower lung atelectasis/scarring. There is no focal consolidation. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal. There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.
