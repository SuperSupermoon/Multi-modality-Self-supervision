Large right pleural effusion is somewhat smaller following insertion of the right pigtail drainage catheter. Right middle and lower lobe are still collapsed. Small left pleural effusion and moderate to severe left lower lobe atelectasis are stable. No pneumothorax. There is greater pulmonary vascular engorgement today, which may indicate early cardiac decompensation. Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is chronic and mitral annulus calcification may indicate mitral regurgitation.
