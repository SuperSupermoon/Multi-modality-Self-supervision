The ET tube tip is not precisely seen, potentially 4.2 cm above the carina. The heart size is unchanged, although note is made that the left costophrenic angle was not included in the field of view. The patient continues to be in pulmonary edema, that has progressed since the prior examination and definitely more substantial than on ___ radiograph. Bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present. The patient most likely has an NG tube, but it cannot be assessed and dedicated examination, focusing on the upper abdomen is recommended.
