In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of cardiac silhouette with increasing bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with worsening pulmonary edema. Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Probable small pleural effusions with compressive basilar atelectasis. In view of the extensive changes in the lungs, it would be difficult radiographically to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
