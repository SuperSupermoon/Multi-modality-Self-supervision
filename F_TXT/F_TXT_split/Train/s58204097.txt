AP chest compared to ___ and ___:14 p.m.: Tip of the endotracheal tube is 2.5 cm or less from the carina and should be withdrawn 2 cm to avoid inadvertent unilateral intubation. Mild pulmonary edema and severe left lower lobe atelectasis unchanged since earlier in the day. Greater opacification at the right lung base could be due to dependent edema or developing atelectasis or even pneumonia and should be followed closely. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper portion of a mildly-to-moderately distended stomach. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in their expected positions. Heart is moderately enlarged, unchanged. No pneumothorax.
