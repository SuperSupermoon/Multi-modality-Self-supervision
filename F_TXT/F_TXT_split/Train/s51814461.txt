In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing prominence of diffuse bilateral opacification, consistent with worsening congestive failure with pulmonary edema. Poor definition of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with layering effusions and compressive basilar atelectasis. Pacer leads remain in good position. Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be impossible to exclude pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
