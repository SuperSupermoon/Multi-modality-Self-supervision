There is substantial worsening of a large right pleural effusion. Persistent right basal opacity could be related to atelectasis or early developing pneumonia. There is a small left pleural effusion, if any. No pneumothorax. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. The azygos vein is dilated and there is pulmonary vascular congestion. Note is made of a cardiac calcification overlying the heart on the right. If additional information is needed regarding cardiac chambers or cardiac calcifications, conventional radiography would be recommended.
