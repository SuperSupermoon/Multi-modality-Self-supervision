1. Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position. There is improved aeration with residual but improving linear opacity at the right base likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis. There is also improved aeration at the left base suggestive of resolving atelectasis. There continues to be diffuse interstitial abnormality with parenchymal distortion which is likely chronic. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. Lungs are hyperinflated suggesting possible underlying emphysema. No pneumothorax is seen. Possible small layering left effusion.
