AP portable upright view of the chest. Lung volumes are low. There is a linear left midlung opacity compatible with scarring as seen on prior PET-CT. Rounded nodular hyperdensities projecting over the left mid lung consistent with calcified granulomas. No convincing evidence for pneumonia or CHF. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with moderate cardiomegaly again noted. Imaged osseous structures are intact.
