Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Crowding of vasculature in the right infrahilar region is likely due to low lung volume. No definite consolidation is identified. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
