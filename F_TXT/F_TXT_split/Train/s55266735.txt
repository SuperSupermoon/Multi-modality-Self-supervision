In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change in the degree of small right apical pneumothorax. Continued hyperexpansion of the lungs with no evidence of cardiomegaly or vascular congestion. Continued increased opacification at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic angle, which could merely reflect small effusion and atelectatic changes, though the possibility of superimposed consolidation would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
