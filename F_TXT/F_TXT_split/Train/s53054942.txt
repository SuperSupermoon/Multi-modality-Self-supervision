The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is minimal atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Minimal streaky opacity within the left lung base may reflect an area of atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
