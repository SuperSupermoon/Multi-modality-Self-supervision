Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged. There is stable mild elevation of the right hemi-diaphragm of uncertain significance. Soft tissue fullness in the right hilar region is felt most likely to reflect prominent vascular structures due to marked patient rotation on the current study. Asymmetric biapical pleural thickening, left greater than right, likely postinflammatory but for which comparison to remote studies would be helpful to assess for stability. There are at least three focal pulmonary pulmonary opacities seen in both upper lobes and in the left mid lung, the largest of which measures approximately 3-4 mm in size. On the left, these opacities are likely calcified given their inherent density and as such, this would favor prior grand granulomatous infection. However, comparison to remote studies to assess for stability would be recommended. If remote studies are not available, further imaging with CT should be undertaken. No evidence of pulmonary edema or focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
