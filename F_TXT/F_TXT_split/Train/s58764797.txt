This study was interpreted in conjunction with the CT of ___. There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, which is due to the known pericardial effusion, with likely early tamponade (relative narrowing of the SVC caliber, without right atrial collapse). The lungs are well expanded and clear, without evidence of pulmonary edema or consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
