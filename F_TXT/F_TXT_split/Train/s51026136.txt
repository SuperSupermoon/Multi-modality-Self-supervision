Study is slightly limited due to mild patient rotation. There is moderate to severe cardiomegaly. Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.4 cm from the carina. Low lung volumes are noted with crowding of the pulmonary vascular structures, and probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Air bronchograms with opacification in both lung bases may reflect areas of infection. Patchy opacities are also noted within the right upper lung field as well as the left upper and mid lung fields, concerning for additional sites of infection or aspiration. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Prominent gaseous distention of the stomach is noted.
