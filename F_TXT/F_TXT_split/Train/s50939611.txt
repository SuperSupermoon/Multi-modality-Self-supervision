Overall, there has been little change in the appearance of the chest since recent study, with persistent large left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation in the left mid and lower lung region. Slight worsening opacity in right lung base most likely represents a combination of atelectasis and small pleural effusion, but superimposed aspiration or infection are possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
