In comparison with study of ___, the Dobhoff tube extends to the distal stomach. Other monitoring and support devices are stable. There has been substantial increase in opacification at the bases with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and underlying compressive atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be very difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view. Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is mild engorgement of pulmonary vessels consistent with mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.
