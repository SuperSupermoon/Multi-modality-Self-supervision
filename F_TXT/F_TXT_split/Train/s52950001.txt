The heart is enlarged. There is persistent retrocardiac opacity and left lower lobe opacification, which could reflect a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis. There is also mild pulmonary edema which is worsened since prior exam. There is a vague nodularity lateral to the left hila for which repeat examination is recommended once edema clears. No pneumothorax or focal consolidation identified.
