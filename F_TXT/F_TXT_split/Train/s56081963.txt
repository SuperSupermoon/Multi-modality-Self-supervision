AP chest compared to ___: An oval lucency at the base of the left hemithorax laterally mimics the appearance on ___, nevertheless it is extremely lucent and may represent a small loculated component of pleural air. There is no pneumothorax elsewhere in the left chest. A small left pleural effusion is smaller today than before, moderate right pleural effusion is stable. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is chronic and the extent of pulmonary vascular engorgement, indicates persistent cardiac dysfunction. Transvenous right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected course to the right ventricle, presumably one is not connected to the left pectoral generator. Thyroid enlargement is longstanding, and could be the explanation for chronic pleural effusions.
