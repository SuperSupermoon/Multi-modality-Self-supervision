This image is centered over the epigastrium, excluding the apices from view. The newly placed Dobbhoff tube courses through the stomach and out of view, with tip projecting over the lower abdomen, likely within the antrum. Two surgical drains and surgical ___ are seen over the abdomen. The lungs, though incompletely assessed, display right greater than left pleural effusions and dense retrocardiac atelectasis, likely unchanged with interval removal of Swan catheter and likely ET tube.
