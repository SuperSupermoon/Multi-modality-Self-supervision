As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared parenchymal opacity at the medial left lung bases, projecting behind the heart. If the clinically suspicion is high, either a frontal and lateral chest radiograph or a CT should be performed. Overall, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus. Moderate cardiomegaly. The right pectoral Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position.
