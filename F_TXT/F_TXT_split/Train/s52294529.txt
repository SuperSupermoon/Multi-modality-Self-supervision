Single portable view of the chest. Low lung volumes are seen with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings. There is no confluent consolidation or evidence of pneumothorax on this supine film. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and in part likely accentuated due to positioning and low lung volumes. Atherosclerotic calcification is seen at the aortic arch. No displaced fractures identified.
