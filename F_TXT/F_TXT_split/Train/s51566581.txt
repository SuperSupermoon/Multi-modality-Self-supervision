Heart size is normal. And aortic core valve device is seen. The mediastinal contour is unremarkable with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob. Hilar contours are within normal limits. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is seen. Lungs are hyperinflated with findings suggestive of emphysema. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a trace left pleural effusion. Streaky atelectasis is noted in the retrocardiac region without focal consolidation. No pneumothorax is present.
