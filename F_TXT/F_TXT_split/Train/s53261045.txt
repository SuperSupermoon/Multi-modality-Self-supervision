Comparison is made to the prior study from ___ at 4:30 a.m. There is a nasogastric tube whose tip and side port are below the GE junction, stable in position from prior. Endotracheal tube has been removed. There is a right-sided subclavian catheter with distal lead tip at the distal SVC, appropriately sited. There is some prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of pulmonary edema, mild. Heart size is within normal limits. There are no pneumothoraces. Degenerative changes of bilateral glenohumeral joints are also seen.
