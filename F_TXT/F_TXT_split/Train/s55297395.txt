Compared with the prior film, an NG tube has been placed. The tip extends beneath the diaphragm, overlying the distal gastric body. The right subclavian PICC line tip now overlies the proximal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. There is rotated positioning with low inspiratory volumes. There are prominent vascular markings as well as atelectasis at the left lung base. While these may be accentuated by low lung volumes, the possibility of some background vascular plethora or left base collapse and/or consolidation would be difficult to exclude.
