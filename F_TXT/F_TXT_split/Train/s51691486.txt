Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates mild interstitial edema. Patchy bilateral parenchymal opacities are noted, and may be related to underlying edema, though focal pneumonia is certainly possible. Biapical scarring is chronic. Re- demonstrated are prominent loops of what appear to be colon in the upper abdomen.
