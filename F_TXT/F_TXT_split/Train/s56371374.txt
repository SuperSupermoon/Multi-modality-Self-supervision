Heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Lung volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema. Opacification of the left base reflects a combination of a moderate size pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis. Minimal atelectasis is also noted in the right lung base. Known left-sided small pneumothorax is not clearly seen on the current exam. Multiple displaced left-sided rib fractures are again noted.
