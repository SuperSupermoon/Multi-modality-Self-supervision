Moderate residual multiloculated left pleural fluid collection is unchanged since the prior study. Substantial atelectasis in the left lower lobe persists. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is also stable. Right lung is grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax. 2 left pleural drains are in place, but I am not familiar with their appearance so I do not know if their positioning is standard. Right jugular line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
