AP chest compared to ___, 4:22 p.m.: A Minnesota or Sengstaken enteric tube traverses the esophagus and upper stomach, with esophageal balloon fully distended and the fundic balloon partially distended to a diameter of 6 cm. There is no large pneumoperitoneum. Small left pleural effusion has increased. Bibasilar atelectasis is moderate to severe, but little changed. Upper lungs are clear. The heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes, probably normal. Tip of the endotracheal tube is partially obscured by the enteric tube, probably in standard position. No pneumothorax.
