An apparent slight increase in the right basal pleural effusion is likely due to dependent a layering. An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip terminates approximately 5.5 cm above the level of the carina. A nasoenteric tube is in-situ, the tip is not visualized but lies below the left hemidiaphragm. There is persistent bibasilar atelectasis. Prominence of the bilateral hila and moderate cardiomegaly suggests a degree of congestive heart failure but no frank pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax seen. Apparent widening of the superior mediastinum is similar when compared to prior studies and likely related to the AP supine technique.
