A dual-lumen central venous catheter terminates in the superior vena cava. Tubing associated with a spinal shunt of the left pleural space appears unchanged. Metastatic lung nodules are not well visualized radiographically. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Partly visualized lower thoracic spinal fixation and cage fusion hardware is noted.
