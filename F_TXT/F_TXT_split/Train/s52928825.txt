Mild cardiomegaly is chronic, exaggerated by low lung volumes, which also make the pulmonary vasculature local more engorged, but I do not think there is ANY good evidence for congestive heart failure. Certainty there is no pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion. Left subclavian pacer defibrillator lead follows the expected course TO THE FLOOR OF THE RIGHT VENTRICLE.
