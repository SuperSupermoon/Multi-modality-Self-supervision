1. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 2 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, the tip not identified. Right internal jugular catheter has its tip in the distal SVC, unchanged. Right subclavian PICC line also has its tip in the distal SVC. 2. Improving mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Persistent retrocardiac opacity and small bilateral layering effusions. Opacity at the left base most likely represents compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning between studies.
