Mild pulmonary edema, substantial increase in cardiac size, Left lower lobe collapse and moderate left pleural effusion are all new. There is no pneumothorax. With the chin in neutral position, tip of the endotracheal tube is less than 15 mm from the carina. It should be withdrawn 2 cm. Curvature of the distal Swan-Ganz catheter suggests it is in the pulmonic valve not a pulmonary artery. Midline and pleural drains are in standard positions. Left jugular line probably ends in the low SVC but the tip is partially obscured.
