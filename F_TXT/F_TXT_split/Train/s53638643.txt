Portable supine view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which exaggerate moderate vascular engorgement; there is no pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or focal consolidation seen. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is top normal. Pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. Small left pneumothorax seen on a reference CT obtained four hours prior, is not appreciated on this radiograph. Erosion of the medial articular surface of the right clavicle is chronic, but should be evaluated when practical.
