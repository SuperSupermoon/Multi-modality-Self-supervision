Multiple lines and tubes have been removed including the intra-aortic balloon pump. A right IJ central line remains present, tip over upper right atrium. New compared with the prior study, there is increased retrocardiac density alteration of the left heart border consistent with left lower lobe collapse and there consolidation likely with associated small to moderate left-sided effusion. There is minimal blunting of right costophrenic angle, without gross effusion. There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base medially. An overt CHF. No pneumothorax detected.
