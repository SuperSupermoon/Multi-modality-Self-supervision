The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube courses through the stomach and out of view. The heart is mildly enlarged. The lung volumes are low, with mild degree of pulmonary edema. There is dense opacity in the retrocardiac left lung base, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation.
