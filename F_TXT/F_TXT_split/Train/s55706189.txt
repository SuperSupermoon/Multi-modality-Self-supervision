Single frontal view of the chest. The catheter of a right chest wall port terminates in the lower SVC. The heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Lung volumes are low, exaggerating bronchovascular markings and hilar crowding. No specific evidence of pulmonary edema. Right base linear opacity is consistent with atelectasis. No lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
