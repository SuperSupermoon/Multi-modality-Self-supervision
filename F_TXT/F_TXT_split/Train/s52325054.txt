Single frontal supine chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes. Ill-defined bilateral central opacities are likely secondary to crowding of the vasculature. No definite focal areas of consolidation is seen. Heart is top normal in size and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is no large pleural effusion. Osseous remodeling at the distal left clavicle could relate to a remote injury.
