AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained three hours earlier during the same day. The patient remains intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea some 4 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. Pulmonary vascular congestive pattern as before. A plate atelectasis has developed in the mid portion of the right hemithorax but no other new pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are seen, and the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. Observe that the patient underwent three chest examinations today. To avoid any misunderstanding, on the first examination at 3 a.m., the patient was intubated. During the second examination at 12:30 p.m., no ETT can be identified, but now the patient is intubated again. The chest findings remain the same and no pneumothorax is seen.
