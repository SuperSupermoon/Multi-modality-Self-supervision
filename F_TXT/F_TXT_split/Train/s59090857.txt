AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Severe multifocal pulmonary consolidation is accompanied by what looks like moderately severe pulmonary edema in the right lung. In the left lower lobe, there is probably a component of volume loss, but overall the relative contributions of lobar collapse, pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage and pulmonary edema are really difficult to distinguish. It is useful to note that the heart is not enlarged and the mediastinal veins are not engorged. At least a moderate left pleural effusion is presumed. Tip of the endotracheal tube, no more than 13 mm from the carina should be withdrawn to 2 cm to avoid unilateral intubation. An upper elementary tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are in standard placements. No pneumothorax.
