Assessment is somewhat limited by patient rotation. The presence of a dense left breast prosthesis obscures assessment of the left lung base and heart. Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged but grossly unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Upper zone vascular redistribution is likely due to supine positioning, without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity within the right lung base may reflect infection or aspiration. There may be a patchy opacity in the left lung base but assessment is suboptimal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly seen on this supine exam. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
