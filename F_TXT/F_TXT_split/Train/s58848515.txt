The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Two left chest tubes and a third catheter are seen overlying the left hemithorax. There continues to be retrocardiac consolidation with probable associated effusion likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. The right lung is grossly clear, although the right costophrenic angle is not entirely included on the study. A left subclavian central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
