Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. A subtle vague opacity in the left lower lung is seen adjacent to the left heart border which could represent tiny focus of pneumonia, though due to low lung volumes, evaluation is somewhat limited. Otherwise, the lungs are clear. No signs of pulmonary edema or effusion. No pneumothorax. Heart and mediastinal contours are normal. Bony structures are intact.
