Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is borderline enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Minimal streaky opacities are seen in the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. Mild to moderate multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
