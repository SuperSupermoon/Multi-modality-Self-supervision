Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Tiny right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is stable. Retrocardiac opacities have increased consistent with increasing atelectasis. Bilateral pleural effusions are grossly unchanged allowing the difference in technique. Right lower lobe atelectasis has increased. Mild vascular congestion is sable. Right basal pigtail catheter remains in place.
