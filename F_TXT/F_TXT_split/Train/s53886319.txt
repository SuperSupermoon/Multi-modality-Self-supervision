AP chest compared to ___: Severe consolidation persists in the right lower lobe. Decrease in volume in the lower lobe is probably responsible for its change in appearance rather than necessarily improvement in the extent of lower lobe pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. Very small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Right pleural drain is conceivably fissural. Right upper lobe is clear. Heart size is normal. Mild peribronchial opacification in the left lower lung is consistent with another focus of pneumonia, particularly aspiration. Left basal pleural drains still in position. Very small left basal pneumothorax persists. There is no pleural effusion. Tracheostomy tube and a right subclavian line end in standard positions, and a feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Drainage tube ends in the mid stomach. No pneumothorax.
