Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. There are new bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis, and fluid in the oblique fissure. New increased opacification in the right mid lung may represent atelectasis, however superimposed infection cannot be excluded. The heart size is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube ends 1.3 cm from the carina and the endotracheal tube cuff appears hyperinflated. Vascular congestion has improved over the interval.
