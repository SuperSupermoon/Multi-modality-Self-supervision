Lung volumes are low. Calcified bilateral pleural plaques are re- demonstrated which somewhat limit assessment of the lung parenchyma. Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged. Superior mediastinal widening is unchanged, and attributable to mediastinal lipomatosis as well as a large right thyroid nodule. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis and/or scarring. Lung volumes are lower compared to the prior study. There is no new focal consolidation is demonstrated, or overt pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
