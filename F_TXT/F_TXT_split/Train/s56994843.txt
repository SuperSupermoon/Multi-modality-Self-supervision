Heart size is top-normal. There is overall unremarkable appearance of the mediastinum but note is made that the patient is rotated substantially. Lungs are essentially clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is substantial sclerosis of the left humeral head, partially imaged and to lesser extent of the right sternal head, please correlate with patient history of potential metastatic disease and dedicated radiographs are essential to those areas.
