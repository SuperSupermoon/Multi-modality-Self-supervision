There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating in the low SVC/ cavoatrial junction. Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 3.9 cm above level the carina. Lung volumes remain low and there is minimal left basilar atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. No large pleural effusion is seen. Again, large lucency beneath the right hemidiaphragm is highly worrisome for pneumoperitoneum.
