AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. The heart is moderately enlarged and within the heart shadow, typical advanced mitral ring calcifications can be identified. Thoracic aorta is moderately widened and elongated but unchanged. No local contour abnormalities are present. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there is no evidence of pleural effusions as the lateral pleural sinuses are free. There are some hazy scattered infiltrates in the left lung base close to the diaphragmatic border, a finding which has slightly increased in comparison with the previous examination and is compatible with aspiration pneumonitis. These changes are rather small. No other pulmonary abnormalities can be identified. No pneumothorax exists in the apical area.
