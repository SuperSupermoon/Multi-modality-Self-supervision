There is new near complete opacification of the left hemithorax without appreciable deviation of the trachea and mediastinum. Increased lucency over the left upper lung field may be due to the aerated superior segment left lower lobe, but a loculated pneumothorax cannot be excluded. There is increased left lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis.
