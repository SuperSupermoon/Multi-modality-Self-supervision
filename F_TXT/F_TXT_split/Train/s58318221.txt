Lung volumes are slightly low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Despite this, there is subtle increase in airspace opacity at the right lung base which may reflect patchy atelectasis although an early infiltrate cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is noted and may be secondary to AP projection.
