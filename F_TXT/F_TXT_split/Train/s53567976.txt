Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There is no evident pneumothorax. Increasing opacity in the right lower hemithorax is consistent with increase in a small right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Mediastinal widening has improved. Mild vascular congestion has almost completely resolved. Left lower lobe atelectasis is grossly unchanged. There are persistent low lung volumes. Cardiomegaly is stable.
