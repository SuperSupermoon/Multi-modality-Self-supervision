Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates hyperexpanded lungs with stable heterogeneous pulmonary consolidation consistent with asymmetrical pulmonary edema or pulmonary hemorrhage on a background of emphysema. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, are unchanged. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax. Right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends in the upper SVC.
