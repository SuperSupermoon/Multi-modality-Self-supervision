The heart is mildly enlarged. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution. There is increased opacity projecting over both lungs likely representing an element of alveolar edema. A left effusion is layering posteriorly and volume loss in the left lower lung. ET tube, NG tube, and right subclavian line are unchanged. Left-sided rib fractures are again seen. Compared to the prior exam the fluid status is slightly worse.
