Lordotic positioning. Low inspiratory volumes. Dobhoff type tube is present --___ tip is seen in the mid abdomen. It follows an atypical course in that date curves back on itself. I suspect that it has passed into the duodenum, but has not passed beyond the ligament of Treitz. The significance of the curvature of the distal tip of the tube is uncertain. Continuing surveillance is recommended. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution and bibasilar atelectasis, similar to the prior film and likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
