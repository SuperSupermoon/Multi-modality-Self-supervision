Right-sided chest tube remains in place. Small right apical pneumothorax has minimally increased in size compared to the prior study, but differences in degree of semi-upright positioning between the two exams could potentially account for this apparent difference. Multifocal patchy and linear opacities in the right middle and both lower lobes are again demonstrated with slight improvement in the right lower lobe. These findings are most likely due to atelectasis.
