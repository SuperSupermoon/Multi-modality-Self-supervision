Additionally, a left internal jugular line is present with tip in the left brachiocephalic vein. An enteric tube is presentin the stomach with distal tip off the film. An additional catheter is seen overlying the midline overlying the trachea with a dense distal tip, which may correlate to an esophageal temperature probe.
