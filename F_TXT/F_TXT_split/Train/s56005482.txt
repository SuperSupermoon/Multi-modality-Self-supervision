There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube with re-expansion of the left lung and significant interval decrease in left-sided pneumothorax, now minuscule in size. Right apical pleural thickening is again seen. There is no new focal consolidation. No pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in inspiration and patient position.
