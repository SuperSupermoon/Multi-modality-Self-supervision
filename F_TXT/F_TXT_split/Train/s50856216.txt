A right-sided PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The patient remains intubated, with the endotracheal tube terminating about 4.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Streaky retrocardiac opacity appears unchanged and most suggestive of minor atelectasis.
