There is no significant change compared to earlier same-day report. Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vasculature. Heart size is likely top normal. Again noted are confluent opacities in nearly the entirety of the right lung field. Given low lung volumes, left lung base and portion of right lung base consolidation is likely atelectatic. Left lung is otherwise clear. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
