Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads in the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. The patient is status post median sternotomy. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable. A subtle left base opacity is seen which could be due to atelectasis, although underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Slight prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature may be due to central pulmonary vascular engorgement. Somewhat curved opacity along the pleura of the right mid hemithorax may be due to loculated pleural effusion or pleural thickening.
