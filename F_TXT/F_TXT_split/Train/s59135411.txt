There has been interval improvement in the degree of mild pulmonary vascular congestion seen previously. The patient is now positioned with a large amount of leftward rotation which makes the left cardiac border more prominent and causes opacification of the left upper lobe due to the underlying scapula. There is no pneumothorax. There are small bilateral pleural effusions and stable cardiomegaly. The remainder of the examination is unchanged.
