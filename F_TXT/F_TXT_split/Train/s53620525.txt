Streaky peribronchiolar opacities in the left infrahilar region appear similar compared to the prior study allowing for slight positional and lung volume differences between the two exams. Overall, however, there is improved aeration in the left retrocardiac region when compared to an earlier radiograph of ___ at 12:32 a.m. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal in appearance, and indwelling endotracheal tube and PICC are unchanged in position. No new areas of consolidation are present within the lungs, and there are no definite pleural effusions or pneumothoraces on the supine radiograph.
