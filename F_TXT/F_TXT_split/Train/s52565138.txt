Comparison is made with prior study ___. There are persistent low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities have minimally increased. This could be due to atelectasis, aspiration or infection. Moderate left effusion has increased. Tiny left apical pneumothorax is less conspicuous than before. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Probably small right effusion is stable. Right Port-A-Cath is in standard position. Left basal pigtail catheter is still in place.
