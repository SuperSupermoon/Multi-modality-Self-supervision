Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Lung volumes remain low with layering bilateral effusions and bibasilar airspace opacities consistent with partial lower lobe atelectasis. Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. Overall, pulmonary edema has improved. No obvious pneumothorax. Heart remains stably enlarged.
