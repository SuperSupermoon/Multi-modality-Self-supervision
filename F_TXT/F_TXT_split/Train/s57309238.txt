A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained. A moderate left pleural effusion and retrocardiac opacity are unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema. The right lung remains clear. Dual-chamber pacing leads project over expected positions. A tunneled right internal jugular dialysis catheter tip terminates in the right atrium. Cardiomegally and aortic arch calcifications are stable.
