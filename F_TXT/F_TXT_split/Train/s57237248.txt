The Hickman catheter is unchanged. The heart size continues to be within normal limits. The mediastinal contours are similar in appearance with a bulging appearance, compatible with known lymphadenopathy. There is ill definition of the vasculature, bilateral effusions and bilateral lower lobe volume loss/infiltrate. The overall impression is that of worsening CHF. An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
