As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased. As a consequence, the pre-existing parenchymal opacity is less dense than on the previous image. There overall extent, however, potentially changed. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant. No change in position and course of the monitoring and support devices.
