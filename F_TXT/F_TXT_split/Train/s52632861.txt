There is a new right-sided internal jugular central line, ending at the cavoatrial junction. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Otherwise there is no significant change in appearance of the thorax compared with the prior exam allowing for technical differences. Increased interstitial and vascular markings are redemonstrated. This AP view is not tailored for assessment of cardiac size. There is no pleural effusion. Rightward deviation of the trachea is likely secondary to a prominent aortic knob. Vertebroplasty cement in the lower thoracic spine is redemonstrated.
