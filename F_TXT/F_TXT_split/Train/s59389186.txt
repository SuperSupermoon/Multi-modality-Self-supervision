As compared to the previous image, the endotracheal tube has been pulled back. The tip of the tube now projects approximately 2.3 cm above the carinal. The course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged. The lung volumes remain low. There is left and right basilar atelectasis but no larger pleural effusions and no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
