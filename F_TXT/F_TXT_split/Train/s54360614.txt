In comparison with study of ___, there is essentially no change. Diffuse pulmonary opacifications persist, especially in the upper zones and left mid lung. The appearance is worrisome for aspiration or pneumonia, since this is an unusual appearance for pulmonary edema unless the patient was in a Trendelenburg position during surgery. Opacification at the left base persists with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and associated pleural effusion. Less prominent changes are seen on the right. Central catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
