Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, with note made of both a nasogastric tube and a second larger bore orogastric or feeding tube, which continues to have a relatively proximal location with the tip terminating at approximately the level of the GE junction. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Improving pulmonary vascular congestion. Widespread consolidation in the right lung has slightly improved in the interval, but there are still large rounded areas of consolidation present in the right upper and mid lung regions. These may be due to round foci of pneumonia, but evolving abscesses should also be considered and correlative CT may be helpful if warranted clinically. Multifocal patchy opacities in the left lung have also improved and likely represent additional sites of infection. Moderate right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size. There is no substantial left pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.
