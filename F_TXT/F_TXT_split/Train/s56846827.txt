There is probable background COPD, with parenchymal scarring. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal, borderline enlarged. There is mild upper zone redistribution. There are increased interstitial markings and peribronchial cuffing. There are some more focal areas of increased markings in the left mid and lower zones and right base medially. The significance of this is uncertain, including whether represents an acute or chronic finding. This could represent a combination of parenchymal scarring and CHF or an infectious or inflammatory infiltrate. No frank consolidation or air bronchograms and no effusion is identified.
