When compared with the prior study, the endotracheal tube still has its tip in the right mainstem bronchus and there is increasing retrocardiac consolidation likely representing left lower lobe collapse. Right internal jugular central line and nasogastric tube appear unchanged in position. There is persistent linear opacity in the right lung which likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
