Feeding tube is been exchanged for a nasogastric tube, which courses below the diaphragm to terminate in the proximal stomach. Side port is proximal to GE junction level and the tube could be advanced several cm for standard positioning. Bilateral partially loculated pleural effusions have slightly increased in size in the interval and multifocal airspace opacities are also slightly worse. Distended loops of bowel in the upper abdomen are incompletely evaluated on this chest radiograph.
