Single supine portable view of the chest. Low lung volumes are noted with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings. Within this limitation and due to limitation of overlying trauma board, the lungs are grossly clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits allowing for this limitation. No displaced fracture is identified.
