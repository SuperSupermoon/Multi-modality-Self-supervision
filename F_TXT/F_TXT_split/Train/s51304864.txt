Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. New right apical and right basal chest tubes are in place. There is a small right basal pneumothorax. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Right IJ catheter tip is in the proximal SVC. ET tube is in standard position, 6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Cardiac size is top normal. Widened mediastinum is stable. There is a small amount of fluid or pleural thickening in the right apex. Extensive bilateral lung opacities have increased in the left mid lung. There is mild right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema. The amount of pleural fluid in the lower lobes bilaterally is decreased,
