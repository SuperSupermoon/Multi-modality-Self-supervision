CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW, LORDOTIC POSITIONING. There are markedly low inspiratory volumes. Right IJ central line tip lies near the SVC/RA junction. There is upper zone redistribution and pulmonary vascular prominence which is likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated. Compared with ___ at 9:09 a.m., I doubt significant interval change. No dense focal consolidation or effusion is identified. Small focus of patchy opacity in the right mid zone again noted.
