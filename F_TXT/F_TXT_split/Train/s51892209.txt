Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.4 cm above the level of the carina. There are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Relative right upper lobe opacity is similar as compared to the prior study from ___, although difficult to tell whether it resolved in the interval and recurred and whether there is some component of aspiration or infection. There may be minimal pulmonary vascular engorgement. Given low lung volumes the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are likely stable as compared to ___. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
