The lungs are low in volume but clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours and pleural surfaces are normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. An ET tube is positioned 6 cm above the carina and by 2-3 cm for optimal position. An NG tube is located within the esophagus and should be pushed in by at least ___-20 cm for optimal position.
