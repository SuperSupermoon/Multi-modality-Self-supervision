As compared to the previous image, the lung volumes have decreased. As a consequence, the radiodensity of the lung bases have also increased. However, there is a minimal zone of radiodense lung at the right lung bases. This zone could represent developing pneumonia and should be followed. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. The patient has been intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 4 cm above the carina. The other monitoring and support devices are constant.
