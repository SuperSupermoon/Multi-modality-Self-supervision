The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle, and likely in the region of the coronary sinus. Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette size is present. The aortic knob is calcified and the aorta is unfolded. Hazy ill-defined opacity in the right hemithorax could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, though infection or aspiration is not excluded. Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus is suggestive of a small pleural effusion. Streaky retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Multiple fractures are noted in the right-sided ribs which appear remote. Dense arterial calcifications are noted within the upper abdomen.
