Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study. The endotracheal tube is unchanged in position, terminating level clavicles. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach, the side port is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC. There is persistent mild cardiomegaly and prominence of the bilateral hila with upper lobe vascular congestion. Appearances are consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion, no overt pulmonary edema. Trace bilateral pleural effusions. No consolidation or pneumothorax seen.
