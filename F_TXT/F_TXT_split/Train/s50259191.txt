Portable frontal view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. Moderate pulmonary edema is new since prior exam. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly also appears progressed from prior study. The left costophrenic angle is obscured, suggestive of small pleural effusion. No large right pleural effusion is seen. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax.
