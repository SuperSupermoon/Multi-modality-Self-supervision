AP chest compared to ___: Improvement in generalized peribronchial pulmonary abnormality between ___ is most readily explained by improving edema. On today's study, moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement have worsened and there has been a slight increase in both the caliber of pulmonary vessels and background density in the lungs. The interval worsening is presumed due to more edema, but could be facilitated by a decrease in positive pressure ventilation support as well as by clinical deterioration. ET tube is in standard placement. An upper enteric drainage tube, partially obscured by external tubing, passes into the stomach and out of view. Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium, as before. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial and there is no pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged at 12 noon when the findings were recognized I discussed the findings by telephone with the resident who responded.
