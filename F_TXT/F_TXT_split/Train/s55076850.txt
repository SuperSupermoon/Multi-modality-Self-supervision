A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a left chest pacer device with leads projecting over the right atrium and ventricle. Lung volumes are low, with bibasilar atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding. The cardiac silhouette is not well evaluated secondary to overlying opacity. There is mild pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacity may be due to a combination of atelectasis and edema, but superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. There may be a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
