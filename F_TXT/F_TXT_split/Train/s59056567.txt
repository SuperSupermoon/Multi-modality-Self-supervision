Semi-upright portable chest radiograph shows an endotracheal tube in place approximately 3 cm above the carina, which is slightly lower than was seen on the study from earlier the same date. Gastric tube and right-sided PICC appear in unchanged position. All lung lobes are aerated, and there is better aeration in the left retrocardiac region, but some bihilar atelectasis persists.
