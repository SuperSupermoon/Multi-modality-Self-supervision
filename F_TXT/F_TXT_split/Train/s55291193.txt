Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There is a new right subclavian catheter with tip in the superior cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. Aeration of the upper lobes bilaterally is improved. Bibasal atelectasis larger on the left side have minimally increased. Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Lines and tubes remain in place in standard position. Mild vascular congestion has minimally improved.
