Two esophageal catheters are present; one terminates in the stomach and the other, likely a temperature probe, just distal to the gastroesophageal junction. In comparison to prior, there has been no change in positioning. The endotracheal tube is 4.7 cm above the carina. A right upper extremity PICC terminates at the confluence of the ipsilateral brachiocephalic and subclavian veins. A right internal jugular catheter is seen within the mid SVC. Lung volumes remain low. Extensive parenchymal opacities are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
