AP chest compared to ___, 3:32 p.m. and 6:15 p.m.: Tip of the new right internal jugular line projects over the low SVC. No pneumothorax, associated pleural effusion, or mediastinal widening. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube ending in the upper stomach would need to be advanced 6 cm to move all the side ports below the GE junction. Lung volumes are lower, partially responsible for worsening mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Small left pleural effusion may be present.
