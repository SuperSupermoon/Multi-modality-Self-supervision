A new left-sided chest tube is noted projecting over the lung base. There has been significant evacuation of the left-sided pleural effusion with some residual effusion still noted. A small apical pneumothorax is present. Patchy opacities in the left upper/mid lung cannot be compared with prior exam as these were obscured by the layering effusion but may represent atelectasis. The right lung is clear. There is no right-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac size cannot be assessed due to obscuration of the left heart border.
