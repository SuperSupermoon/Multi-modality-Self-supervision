As compared to the recent radiograph from earlier the same date, is right apical pneumothorax has decreased in size with small residual pneumothorax remaining and pigtail pleural catheter in place. An additional basilar component of the pneumothorax is suspected. Exam is otherwise remarkable for rapid improvement in diffuse combined alveolar and interstitial opacities, likely due to pulmonary edema although coexisting infection is possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
