As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. The pre-existing opacities in the right lung have increased in severity. The lower of these opacities could be caused by a small amount of intrafissural in capsulated pleural effusion. The overall lung volumes remain low. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. There is unchanged evidence of a small left apical pneumothorax.
