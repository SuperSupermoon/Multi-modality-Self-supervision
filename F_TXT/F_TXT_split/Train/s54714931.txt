Markedly rotated positioning. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.1 cm above the carina. Left-sided pacemaker device overlies the left shoulder, with lead tip over right ventricle. Right IJ central line tip lies in the region of the cavoatrial junction or upper most right atrium. There is marked enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, as well as mediastinal venous engorgement, similar to the prior film. Hazy opacity in the left lung could represent atelectasis, possibly accentuated by small amount of layering left pleural fluid. Increased opacity at the right base is compatible with small effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, and is also similar to the prior study. Probable vascular plethora/mild edema similar to the prior study. Left lung apex is obscured by the device overlying the patient. No new right-sided pneumothorax is detected.
