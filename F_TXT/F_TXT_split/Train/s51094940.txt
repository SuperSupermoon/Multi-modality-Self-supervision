CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared to the prior film, the ET tube and NG tube are no longer visible. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged, somewhat less pronounced due to differences in technique. There remains upper zone re-distribution and CHF with interstitial edema as well as slight patchy opacity at both bases with some air bronchograms in the retrocardiac area. However, the extent of the CHF and the basilar opacities may be very slightly improved. No gross effusion is identified. No pneumothorax is detected.
