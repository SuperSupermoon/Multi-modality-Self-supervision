Persistent more focal areas of consolidation in the left mid and lower lung are seen and could reflect pneumonia. However, there is increasing pulmonary opacities bilaterally suggesting that these findings could solely reflect worsening asymmetric moderate to severe pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation is recommended. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Probable small layering effusions. Patient is status post median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement and stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Right subclavian central line, left internal jugular dual-lumen catheter, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position.
