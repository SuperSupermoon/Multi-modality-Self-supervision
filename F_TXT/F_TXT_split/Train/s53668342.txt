In comparison with the study of ___, the left subclavian line has been removed. Other monitoring and support devices are stable. Again there are low lung volumes that accentuate the moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Given the low lung volumes, there is minimal if any pulmonary vascular congestion. The right hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen. This is consistent with pleural fluid and substantial volume loss in the right lower and possibly middle lobes. Retrocardiac opacification is essentially unchanged.
