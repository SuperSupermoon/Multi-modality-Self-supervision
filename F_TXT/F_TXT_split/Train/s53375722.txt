The right chest wall power injectable port, the tip projecting over the superior cavoatrial junction. Low bilateral lung volumes with a persisting retrocardiac opacity silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm as well as small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax identified. The size of the cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged. Sclerosis of both humeral heads is again seen, consistent with the patient's known osteoblastic metastatic disease.
