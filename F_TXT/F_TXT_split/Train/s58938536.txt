Compared to the prior exam, lung volumes have slightly decreased. Linear streaky bilateral lower lung opacities are most likely atelectasis, perhaps minimally increased from the prior exam. Elevation of right hemidiaphragm is unchanged and supports volume loss. Slight right shift of the mediastinum is also overall unchanged, further supporting volume loss. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No focal consolidation to suggest focal pneumonia. Heart size is difficult to assess given the projection provided.
