Portable AP upright radiograph of the chest was obtained. New opacity seen in the left base is compatible with a pneumonia. Opacification of the right hemithorax is compatible with history of pneumonectomy and resultant rightward shift of mediastinal structures. Cardiac silhouette is not well evaluated. Accompanying left pleural effusion may be present. No pneumothorax is seen.
