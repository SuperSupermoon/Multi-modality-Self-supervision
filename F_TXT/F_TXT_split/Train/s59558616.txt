Compared to prior chest radiographs ___. Lung volumes are lower despite tracheal intubation. ETT tip is no less than 15 mm from the carina the actual distance is distorted by patient positioning. Trachea is not actually quite short and ETT positioning will require periodic radiographic confirmation. Poor definition of the lower tracheal AND right bronchial airway could be due to retained secretions. Clinical correlation advised. No definite pulmonary edema or evidence of pneumonia. New small left pleural effusion is likely. No pneumothorax.
