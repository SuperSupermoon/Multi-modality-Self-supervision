There is near complete opacification of the right hemithorax which may reflect a layering effusion with associated lobar atelectasis or worsening pneumonia. The left lung is relatively well inflated with the exception of the retrocardiac region where there is likely compressive atelectasis or aspiration in the setting of a smaller effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Hardware is again seen overlying the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine.
