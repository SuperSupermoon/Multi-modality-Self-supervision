Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs are fully expanded and clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hila contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Again noted is angulation of the right ___ and 8th ribs which may represent prior trauma.
