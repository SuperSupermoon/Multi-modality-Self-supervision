In comparison with chest radiograph from a few hours earlier, there has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube that terminates approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. There is pulmonary vascular congestion with moderate pulmonary edema. Left retrocardiac opacity, consistent with atelectasis, is unchanged. No enteric tube is visualized on current study.
