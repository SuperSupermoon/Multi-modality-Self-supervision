There is hyperinflation with increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs which are most suggestive of a chronic interstitial process. Linear right basilar opacity is unchanged and likely due to scarring with adjacent emphysematous changes. Nodular opacity projects over the left mid lung not clearly identified on prior. Enlar cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. No acute osseous abnormalities.
