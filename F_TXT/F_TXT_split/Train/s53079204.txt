Interval intubation with placement of an endotracheal tube that lies 2 cm above carina. The right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC. The patient is markedly rotated to the left and there is complete opacification of the left hemithorax which limits evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. There is an abrupt cutoff of the left mainstem bronchus which raises the possibility of a mucus plug. A large pleural effusion or pulmonary hemorrhage with collapse of the left lung could also have this imaging appearance. Results of this study were discussed with ___, the patient's nurse, as well as ___, the patient's housestaff on ___ by phone at 4:20 p.m. The right lung is clear with the exception of patchy opacity at the base which could reflect an area of atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Spinal hardware is again seen obscuring the midline.
