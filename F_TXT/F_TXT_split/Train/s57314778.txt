Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates increased lung volumes and flattening of the hemidiaphragms, as well as attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings, compatible with severe emphysema. Right lateral lung base opacities are longstanding and likely reflect scarring. Bibasilar streaky opacities could reflect atelectasis or infection. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is mild perihilar vascular congestion. Aortic arch calcifications are again noted. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Heart size is top normal. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
