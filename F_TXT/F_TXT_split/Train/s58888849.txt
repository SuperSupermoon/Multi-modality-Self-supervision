Spinal hardware and skin ___ are seen overlying the upper and mid thoracic spine. A left subclavian central line is in place with its tip in the mid SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There is an endotracheal tube in place with the tip somewhat challenging to identify as it appears to be obscured by the spinal hardware, but it is at least at the level of the thoracic inlet. Heart is likely mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are difficult to evaluate due to patient rotation. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. There is suggestion of parenchymal distortion in both upper lobes and on the right, there is a suggestion of some bronchiectasis. This would favor post-inflammatory scarring rather than an acute process. Comparison to old films would be helpful. The lower lungs appear grossly clear. No large effusions. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity of pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
