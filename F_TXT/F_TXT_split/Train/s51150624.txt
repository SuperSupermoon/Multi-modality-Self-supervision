As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain low. The pre-existing parenchymal opacity and consolidation in the retrocardiac lung regions. With air bronchograms, is not substantially changed. The opacity might reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or a combination of both. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions.
