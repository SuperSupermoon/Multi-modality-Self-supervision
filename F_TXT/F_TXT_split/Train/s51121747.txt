Compared to ___ at 21:11, a thin tube overlying the upper mediastinum has been retracted -- it previously overlay the lower mediastinum and now lies at the level of the carina. Clinical correlation is requested. ET tube, NG tube, and right IJ line are unchanged. There is slight the patient rotation on the current film. Allowing for this, again seen are extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities, overall quite similar to the earlier film. However, the right hemidiaphragm is slightly better defined on today's exam, which could indicate very slight interval improvement . The cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by the parenchymal infiltrates. No pneumothorax detected.
