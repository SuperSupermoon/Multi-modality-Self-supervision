In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter extends to lower portion of the SVC. Nasogastric tube coils within the fundus of the stomach and then extends to at least the lower body. Right subclavian catheter tip is in the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. There is again evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. In the appropriate clinical setting, some of the bilateral pulmonary opacifications could certainly represent supervening pneumonia.
