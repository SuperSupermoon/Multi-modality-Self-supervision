There has been placement of a right-sided PICC line. The distal tip is pointing cephalad and this needs to be readjusted. No pneumothoraces are identified. Heart size is within normal limits. There is prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of pulmonary edema. However, superimposed infection is also possible given that the vascular pedicle is not widened. There is atelectasis at the left lung base. Small left-sided pleural effusion is seen.
