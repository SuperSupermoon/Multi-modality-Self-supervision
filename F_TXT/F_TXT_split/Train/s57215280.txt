Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again seen. Diffuse airspace opacity is seen within the lungs, marginally worse compared with prior. Findings are concerning for fluid pneumonia or possibly pulmonary edema. Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged. Bony structures appear grossly intact with old deformity of the right mid clavicle again noted.
