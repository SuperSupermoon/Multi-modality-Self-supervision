In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better inspiration. Again there is mild-to-moderate vascular congestion in a patient with intact midline sutures and prosthetic right shoulder. Old fracture deformities of the distal clavicles are again seen. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle could reflect small effusion or pleural thickening.
