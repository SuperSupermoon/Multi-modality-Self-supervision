In comparison with the study of ___, the bilateral pulmonary opacifications have increased. In view of the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, the appearance most likely reflects pulmonary edema with bilateral layering pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases. The spiculated lesions in the left lower lobe seen on the PET-CT are obscured by the cardiac silhouette. Other spiculated masses also cannot be definitely identified on the current study.
