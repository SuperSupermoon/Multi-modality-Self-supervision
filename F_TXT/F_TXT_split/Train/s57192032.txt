AP chest compared to ___: Rightward mediastinal shift has improved probably due to decrease in moderate-sized left pleural effusion. Heterogenous opacification in the lungs, still most pronounced in the right upper lobe could be asymmetric pulmonary edema, but pneumonia is not excluded. Heart size top normal, partially obscured by pleural abnormality. Mediastinal venous engorgement improved. Right PIC line ends low in the SVC. No pneumothorax.
