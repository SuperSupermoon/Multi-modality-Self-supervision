The NG tube has been minimally advanced but the side port is still near the gastroesophageal junction. Further advancement by 4-5 cm would be advised. The endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 1.5 cm above the carina and pullback of 2 cm, which was previously recommended, is still advised. The previously seen pneumothorax is not well visualized on this study, but this could be related to supine technique. Followup imaging in the upright position would be advised. A clip is seen within a nodular opacity at the right medial base, which was placed by a CT-guided interventional procedure on ___, in this patient with known lung malignancy. Overall, the lung volumes are slightly lower and there is patchy opacity at the right base, likely reflecting atelectasis. No large effusions. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
