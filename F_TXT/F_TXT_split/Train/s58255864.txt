AP chest compared to ___: The patient has been extubated, and the already low volume lungs are lower in volume today, with more consolidation in the lower lungs, either pneumonia or pneumonia worsened by atelectasis. Low lung volumes are responsible in part for further widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette probably due to at least mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement. Pleural effusion is small if any. There is no pneumothorax.
