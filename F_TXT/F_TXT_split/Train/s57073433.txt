In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes have been removed. Right pleural catheter remains in place and there is no pneumothorax. Central catheters are in good position. Cardiac silhouette appears to be more prominent than on the previous study and there is further fullness of indistinct pulmonary vessels consistent with worsening pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectasis and effusion.
