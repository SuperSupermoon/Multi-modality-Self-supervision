The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The tracheostomy tube tip terminates 3 cm above the carina. A left chest wall Port-A-Cath terminates in the proximal right atrium. The lung volumes are low with mild crowding of the basal bronchovascular markings. No consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Gaseous distention of the imaged portion of the small and large bowel loops in the abdomen is unchanged since multiple prior studies.
