AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. The heart size is within normal limits. Moderate widening and elongation of thoracic aorta, but no local contour abnormalities are identified. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. No signs of acute parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral pleural sinuses are free. Moderate elevation of the left hemidiaphragm coincides with gas-distended left-sided colonic loops. No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. No indwelling lines or tubes. Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for comparison.
