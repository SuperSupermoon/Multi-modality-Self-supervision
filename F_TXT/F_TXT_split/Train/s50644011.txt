Lung volumes remain low. The right PICC tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Heart size remains mildly enlarged, and is accentuated by the low lung volumes. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures as a result of low lung volumes with probable mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Bibasilar opacities appear progressed compared to the prior exam, and may reflect worsening atelectasis though infection is not excluded. Small left pleural effusion persists. No pneumothorax is identified.
