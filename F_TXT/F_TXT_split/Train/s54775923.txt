Evaluation is limited due to patient rotation with resultant accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Within this limitation, an endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the thoracic inlet approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. An enteric tube terminates in the lower esophagus, which should be advanced for proper positioning. The inspiratory lung volumes are low. The right hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated. There is right basilar opacification. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
