New right lung base pleural drain has been placed with tip ending laterally. Right lung base opacities have apparently improved, although comparison is difficult due to patient positioning. Bilateral small opacities already characterized as calcified granulomas in CT of ___ are unchanged. Heart size is top normal. Blunting of the right costovertebral space is probably due to pleural effusion. Small right apical pneumothorax. New subcutaneous emphysema is alongside the left chest wall and in the cervical region.
