ETT in standard position. Left internal jugular venous catheter tip projects over the expected region of the right atrium, unchanged. Enteric tubes traverse the midline into the left upper quadrant 0, beyond the scope of this image. Right pigtail catheter projects over the lower right hemithorax and appears slightly kinked. Bilateral airspace opacities, more confluent in the left and also in the right lower lobe are overall minimally changed from the prior exam, consistent with history of ARDS and concurrent right lower lobe pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is overall unchanged. No effusion. No pneumothorax.
