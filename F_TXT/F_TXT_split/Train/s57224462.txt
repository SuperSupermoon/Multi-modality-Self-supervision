In comparison with the study of ___, there is substantial residual bilateral pulmonary opacifications, though overall there is slight improvement (though some of this may merely reflect better inspiration). The overall appearance is consistent with severe pulmonary edema, though in the appropriate clinical setting supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Nasogastric tube has been removed and replaced with an esophageal temperature probe, which also has an unusual configuration raising the possibility of large hiatal hernia. Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
