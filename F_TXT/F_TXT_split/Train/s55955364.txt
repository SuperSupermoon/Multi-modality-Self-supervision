Bilateral chest tubes are unchanged in position. An endotracheal tube is seen 2.7 cm from the carina. The right central line ends at the atriocaval junction. A feeding tube is in place with the tip out of the field of view. In comparison to the prior radiograph, there are lower lung volumes which is likely due to acquisition of the image in a different phase of the respiratory cycle or decrease in PEEP. As a consequence, the right and left lower lobe opacities appear slightly larger, but are likely unchanged in size. There is a small left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The previously seen deep sulcus sign is not present. Again noted are rib fractures of the seventh and eighth right ribs.
