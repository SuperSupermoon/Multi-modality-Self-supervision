Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There are low lung volumes. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard positions. Bibasilar consolidations have minimally improved. Small left pleural effusion has probably minimally increased, though the change could be just difference is positioning of the patient. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Pulmonary edema is stable.
