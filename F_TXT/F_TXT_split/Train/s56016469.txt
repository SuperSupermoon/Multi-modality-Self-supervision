A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes and unchanged cardiomegaly. No definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified, although evaluation is limited secondary to obscuration of the right apex. There is minimal, if any, pleural fluid on the left. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
