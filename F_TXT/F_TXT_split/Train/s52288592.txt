As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared parenchymal opacity at the right lung bases, likely reflecting a combination of small pleural effusion and atelectasis. The morphology is not suggestive of aspiration or pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No pulmonary edema. The right internal jugular vein catheter is constant.
