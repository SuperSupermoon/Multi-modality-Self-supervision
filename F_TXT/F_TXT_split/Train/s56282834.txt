As compared to the previous radiograph, the tracheostomy tube and the left-sided PICC line are in unchanged position and show unchanged course. The widespread bilateral parenchymal opacities, particularly severe in the right upper lobe and in the entire left lung, diffuse in distribution and displaying multiple air bronchograms, are unchanged in severity. At the right lung base, existing opacity has minimally increased in extent. There is new blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting a small left pleural effusion. No other changes. No pneumothorax.
