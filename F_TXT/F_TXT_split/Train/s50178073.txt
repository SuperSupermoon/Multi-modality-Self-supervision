The patient is now status post right thoracoplasty. There are two new cerclage wires in the right chest wall. There is a new right chest tube which is appropriately positioned within the pleural cavity. The lucency in the right hemithorax in the extra thoracic soft tissues has greatly decreased in size, likely reflecting repair of lung herniation noted on the prior radiograph. There is still some subcutaneous emphysema present. A curvilinear lucency in the right lower chest may reflect the edge of a pneumatocele. There is a small to moderate right pleural effusion mainly tracking up the lateral hemithorax and into the major fissure. There is extensive bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. No large pneumothorax is seen. The heart size is normal.
