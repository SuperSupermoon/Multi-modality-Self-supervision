Moderate cardiomegaly is exaggerated by lower lung volumes. There is greater consolidation today at the base of the left lung than it was on ___. This could be due to either atelectasis or recent aspiration or even pneumonia. No pneumothorax. Transvenous pacer lead follows the expected course. Dr. ___ was paged at 12:05 p.m. as soon as the findings were recognized and we discussed the findings at 12:20pm.
