The left-sided chest tubes are unchanged in position. There may be a tiny left apical pneumothorax, which is expected given the presence of a chest tube. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are persistent. Increase in opacities at the lung bases bilaterally may be concerning for worsening infection. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
