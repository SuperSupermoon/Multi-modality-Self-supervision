Assessment is limited by patient rotation and low lung volumes. Heart size is moderately enlarged. Widening of the mediastinal contours is likely due to low lung volumes. There is mild pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Atelectatic changes are seen in the lung bases. No acute osseous abnormalities present.
