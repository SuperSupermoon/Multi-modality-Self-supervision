Comparison is made with prior study ___. There is moderate cardiomegaly. ET tube is in a standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. There are asymmetric opacities throughout the lungs, larger in the right lung mainly in the right perihilar and right lower lobes. These have worsened from prior study. These could be due to asymmetric worsening edema, but superimposed infection is likely present. Amount of pleural effusions is difficult to assess, it is larger on the right side.
