Lordotic positioning is noted. Right basilar opacity is compatible with at least some component of pleural effusion. Distortion of the underlying parenchyma may be due to scarring and likely atelectasis. Superimposed infection would certainly be possible. There is suggestion of a nodular density at the right lung base as seen on prior. Possible small left pleural effusion is also suspected. Moderate cardiac enlargement is noted, not grossly changed given differences in technique.
