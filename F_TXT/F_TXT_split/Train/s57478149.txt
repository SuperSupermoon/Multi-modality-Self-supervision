Left pleural drain has been pulled in slightly higher position. The lung volume is still low. The right lung base opacification is slightly improved. The left lung is still opacified at the base, might be atelectasis but pneumonia cannot be excluded. Severe subcutaneous emphysema is stable. Pneumomediastinum is slightly increased, especially alongside the left upper lobe, where minimal increase of pneumothorax cannot be excluded. Heart size is top normal. Aorta is mildly elongated with calcification in the aortic arch as for aortosclerosis.
