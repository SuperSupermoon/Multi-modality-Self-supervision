New right jugular line ends in the lower SVC. There is new leftward displacement of the trachea, which was previously displaced to the right by arch, and excessive tissue separating the trachea from the jugular line, which bulges to the right. These findings suggest hematoma associated with line placement, rapidly developing mediastinal adenopathy, abscess, or fluid collection. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Lungs are clear. Heart size is normal.
