A single portable frontal supine view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina. Left IJ central venous catheter is in the lower SVC. Enteric tube enters the stomach but tip is excluded from the image. Obliteration of the left diaphragm is consistent with left lower lobe consolidation. Right lung is clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and remains shifted to the left, indicating volume loss in the left lung.
