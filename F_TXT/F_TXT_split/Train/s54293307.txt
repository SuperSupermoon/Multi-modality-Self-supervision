1. Endotracheal tube has its tip 4.7 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing to the level of the diaphragm but cannot be followed more distally due to underpenetration at the bases. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. The diffuse bilateral airspace process, more confluent on the right than the left, has not significantly changed ___ at 4:34 a.m., but has improved since ___ at 5:23. These findings suggest either asymmetric pulmonary edema or improving aspiration pneumonia or hemorrhage. Clinical correlation is advised. No large effusions. No pneumothorax.
