Following removal of one of two left-sided chest tubes, there is no visible pneumothorax on the left. Single right-sided chest tube remains in place with a questionable very small lateral pneumothorax at the level of the right third posterolateral rib. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for postoperative status of the patient. Multifocal atelectasis persist predominantly in the lower lobes and lingula, with some improved aeration at the left base and slight worsening at the right base.
