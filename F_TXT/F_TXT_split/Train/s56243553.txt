Endotracheal tube is in standard position, terminating 4 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube tip courses through the stomach, with tip projecting off the inferior borders of the film. Left basilar chest tube remains in unchanged position. The heart size remains moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contours are relatively unchanged, with mild calcification of the thoracic aorta noted. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, with cephalization of the pulmonary vascular markings, new compared to the prior exam. Partially loculated right pleural effusion which is moderate in extent appears relatively unchanged, and a small left pleural effusion persists. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
