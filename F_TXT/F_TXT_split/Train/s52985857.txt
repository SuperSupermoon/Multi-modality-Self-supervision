As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.7 cm above the carina. There is moderate atelectasis of the middle lobe. A nasogastric tube has been newly inserted. The tip of the tube is not visible on the image, but the course of the tube is unremarkable. The previously placed right internal jugular vein catheter has been removed. Low lung volumes. No overt pulmonary edema, no larger pleural effusions.
