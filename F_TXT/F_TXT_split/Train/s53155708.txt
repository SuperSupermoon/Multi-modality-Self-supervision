The ET tube terminates approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. The enteric tube is coiled in the oropharynx, however the tip terminates in the distal esophagus and must be advanced. The consolidation is seen in the mid right hemithorax. There is pulmonary vascular congestion, otherwise the hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is right basilar atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There may be small right pleural effusion. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
