A tracheostomy tube, right internal jugular tunneled central venous line, left internal jugular central venous line and nasoenteric tube are unchanged, in appropriate position. Right lung parenchymal opacities are not significantly changed compared to the prior study, possibly aspiration or asymmetric pulmonary edema. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Left basilar atelectasis is stable.
