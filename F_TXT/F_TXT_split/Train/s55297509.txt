A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Right basilar opacity is due to atelectasis. A subpleural opacity in the left mid lung is due to a left anterior rib mass seen on the prior CT. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
