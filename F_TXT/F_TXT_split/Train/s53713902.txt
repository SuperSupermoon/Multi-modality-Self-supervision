AP chest reviewed in the absence of recent chest imaging. Large pneumoperitoneum was not evident on abdomen CT scan, ___, which showed a massively distended stomach. I do not know if the patient has had interval abdominal surgery. Preliminary report notes the large amount of diaphragmatic free air and plans for the patient to undergo exploratory laparotomy, per Dr. ___, in an untimed note. ET tube at the carina should be withdrawn 3-4 cm. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach which is probably less distended today than on yesterday's CT scan. Bibasilar atelectasis is relatively mild. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal.
