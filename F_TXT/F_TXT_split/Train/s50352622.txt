There has been interval adjustment of the patient's NG tube, which is now seen terminating in a post pyloric location. As compared to prior examination from 2 hr earlier, the remainder of the exam is essentially unchanged. The right upper lobe opacification is stable, consistent with post radiation changes and atelectasis. There is no evidence of new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
