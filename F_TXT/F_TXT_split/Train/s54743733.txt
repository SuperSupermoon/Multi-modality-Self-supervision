No large pleural effusion. On ___, the chest radiograph did not show a pneumothorax despite the presence of a left pneumothorax on CT. The current study does not show a pneumothorax, suggesting it is not larger. The heart is enlarged. After reviewing the CT torso from ___, the findings suggest the presence of Tetralogy of Fallot, potentially as an indication for his childhood cardiac surgery.
