As compared to the previous radiograph, there is little overall change. Relatively extensive retrocardiac atelectasis, potentially associated to a small left pleural effusion. Lung volumes remain low. There are areas of minimal atelectasis at the right lung base. The intra-abdominal air, seen on the previous image, is no longer present. The size of the cardiac silhouette remains unchanged. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged right PICC line.
