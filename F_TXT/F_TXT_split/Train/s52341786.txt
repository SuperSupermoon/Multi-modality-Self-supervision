As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in interstitial markings bilaterally, notably in the periphery of the lung bases. This finding could be suggestive of mild interstitial edema rather than of pneumonia. There is no real focal abnormality visualized on today's image. Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unchanged, with extensive emphysematous changes, notably in the left apex and a staple line after left upper lobe surgery. No pleural effusions. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
