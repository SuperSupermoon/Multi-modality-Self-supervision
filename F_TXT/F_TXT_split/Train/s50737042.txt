Right lower lung volume loss secondary to right lower lobe collapse is overall unchanged. Any contribution from collapsed right middle lobe is indeterminate. Mild left lower lung opacity is probably atelectasis and constant. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, widened mediastinum and moderate cardiomegaly is similar. Endotracheal tube ends 6.5 cm above the carina, right subclavian line tip is in the right upper atrium, right internal jugular sheath tip is at mid SVC, single lead from left pectoral ICD ends into the right ventricle, while feeding tube and orogastric tube terminate into the stomach appropriately. Pleural effusion, if any, are small bilaterally and unchanged.
