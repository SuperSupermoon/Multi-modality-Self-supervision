Tip of right PICC terminates deep within the right atrium, as communicated by phone to IV therapy nurse ___ at 12:45 p.m. on ___ at the time of discovery. Pre-existing right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged. Low lung volumes accentuate cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Even allowing for this factor, there has been apparent interval increase in caliber of mediastinal vascular structures and pulmonary vessels, accompanied by vascular indistinctness, perihilar haziness, and more confluent opacities in the lung bases. Observed findings are suggestive of fluid overload. Additionally, there is partial right lower lobe atelectasis.
