The lungs are clear with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. No acute fractures are identified. There is slight prominence of the superior mediastinal tissues, likely due to technique. If further characterization is necessary, PA and lateral radiographs may be obtained.
