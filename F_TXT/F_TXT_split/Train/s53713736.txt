Comparison is made to prior study from ___. Heart size is unchanged. There is again seen a right IJ central line with distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. There is worsening of the consolidation at the bases, which are more confluent and are suggestive of either pneumonia and/or aspiration. Worse along the right base. There are no pneumothoraces.
