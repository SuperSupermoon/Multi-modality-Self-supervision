The overlying trauma board somewhat limits the evaluation. The endotracheal tube terminates 4.8 cm above the carina. An enteric tube terminates at the gastroesophageal junction and could be advanced 8-10 cm for termination within the stomach. The lungs show no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is normal size. The hilar structures are unremarkable. An air distended stomach is noted.
