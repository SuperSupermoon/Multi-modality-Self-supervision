As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is now intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.5 cm above the carinal. No pneumothorax. The lung volumes have increased. As a consequence, the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities have slightly decreased in extent and severity but are still clearly present, with little overall change.
