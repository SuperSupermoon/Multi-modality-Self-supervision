The AP single view of the chest demonstrates significant cardiac enlargement even considering possible of geometric distorsion as patient was examined in semi-upright position using AP views. In comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___, the heart size has further increased. The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates now bilateral marked perivascular haze and distended vessels in comparison with the previous exam and is indicative of at least moderate degree of CHF. Observed is also a resected rib in the left hemithorax (probably ___ 6), finding which already was present on the preceding study. The diaphragms are relatively high positioned indicating poor inspirational effort and adding to crowded appearance of pulmonary vasculature. The lateral pleural sinuses, however, remain free of any major fluid accumulation. No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area.
