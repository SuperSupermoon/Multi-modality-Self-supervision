An enteric tube is seen coiling within the expected location of the cervical esophagus. The tip is not visualized. An endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina, likely due to chin positioning. A right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC, unchanged in position. There has been interval improvement of pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Retrocardiac opacity and mild right base atelectasis have slightly improved.
