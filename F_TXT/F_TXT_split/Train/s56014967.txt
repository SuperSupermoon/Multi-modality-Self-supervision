Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Lungs are hyperinflated with biapical scarring re- demonstrated. Minimal streaky opacities seen within the lung bases, findings which could reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is otherwise noted. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
