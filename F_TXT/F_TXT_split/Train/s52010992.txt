Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is present with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected.
