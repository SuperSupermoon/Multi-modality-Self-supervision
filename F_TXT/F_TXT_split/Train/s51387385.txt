The tip of the endotracheal tube is relatively high and projects 6 cm above the carina. The tube could be advanced by 2 to 3 cm. The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, the tip is not visible on the current image. There is a cerebral fixation device and a high-density structure projecting over the single vertebral body at the thoracolumbar junction. No evidence of rib fractures. Bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral areas of atelectasis at the lung bases. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Normal appearance of the mediastinum. The effusions and areas of atelectasis should be short term monitored for resolution, given the possibility of aspiration or pneumonia.
