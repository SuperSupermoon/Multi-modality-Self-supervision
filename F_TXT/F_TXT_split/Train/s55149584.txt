A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal tube which is unchanged in position. A right infrahilar opacity is similar in appearance to prior radiograph and again could represent overlap of vascular structures, but underlying consolidation is not excluded. Streaky linear opacities at the left base are also unchanged and likely represent atelectasis. The heart is normal in size and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
