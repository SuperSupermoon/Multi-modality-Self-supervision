The large multiloculated right pleural effusion has continued to increase in size. There is increasing opacity primarily involving the right mid and lower lung likely representing atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Stable faint rounded opacity at the right apex corresponds to loculated fluid and adjacent mass on recent CT. Associated right pleural thickening and nodularity is better evaluated on the patient's prior CT examinations. Right paratracheal soft tissue is consistent with known lymphadenopathy. On the left, there is a small pleural effusion and associated partial lower lobe atelectasis. The left upper and mid lung is grossly clear. A right pigtail catheter is coiled at the right lung base. Numerous surgical clips overlie the right axilla and the patient is status post right mastectomy. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Interval enlargement of heart size since ___ consistent with known pericardial effusion.
