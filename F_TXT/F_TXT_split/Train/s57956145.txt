There has been interval placement of spinal rods overlying the thoracic spine. An endotracheal tube has its tip cyst at the thoracic inlet and nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. A right subclavian central line has its tip in the distal SVC. There is marked patient rotation to the right, limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. The right lung is grossly clear. There is a subtle haziness to the entire left hemithorax which may be related to patient positioning or could reflect a layering pleural effusion. Clinical correlation is advised. In addition, there is more focal airspace opacity in the left lower lung which could reflect atelectasis or early pneumonia. Follow up imaging would be advised. No large pneumothorax is appreciated.
