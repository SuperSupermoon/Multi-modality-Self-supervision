A feeding tube remains unchanged with its tip projecting over the stomach. There continues to be persistent opacity at both lung bases suggestive of at least partial atelectasis of the right lower and middle lobes and the left lower lobe and lingula. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Given differences in technique and positioning, no significant interval change is seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Patient's mandible obscures a portion of the right apex. Calcified bilateral saline breast implants are again seen.
