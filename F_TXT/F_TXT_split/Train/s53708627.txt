Interval improvement in combined bilateral alveolar and interstitial opacities, most likely due to decreasing pulmonary edema, although differential diagnosis includes pulmonary hemorrhage and atypical or opportunistic infection. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are present, with apparent slight increase on the right in the interval. No pneumothorax.
