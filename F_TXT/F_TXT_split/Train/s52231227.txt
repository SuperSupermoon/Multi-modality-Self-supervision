As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone right thoracocentesis. There is a minimal millimetric pneumothorax after this procedure. The extent of the right pleural effusion has substantially decreased, the effusion is almost completely resolved. A small pleural drain is seen projecting over the right costophrenic sinus. On the left, the diffuse parenchymal opacities, with air bronchograms and inhomogeneous distribution, have increased as compared to the previous image. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
