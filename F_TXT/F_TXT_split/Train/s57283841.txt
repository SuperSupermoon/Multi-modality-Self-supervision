An endotracheal tube has been placed, which terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina. There is unfolding of the thoracic aorta. An orogastric tube has been passed into the stomach. There is some widening between the aortic contour and trachea with the esophageal tube coursing in between. Probably this will return out to be within normal limits, and could be seen with a tortuous aorta or prominent mediastinal fat, but the possibility of aortic pathology cannot be excluded. Bilaterally, there is perihilar opacification, most suggestive of mild fluid overload or congestion, although other etiologies such as aspiration or pneumonia are not excluded. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
