Compared with the prior film, the ETT, NGT, and additional tubing or central mediastinal line or pleural have been removed. The right IJ catheter is again seen, with tip over proximal/mid SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen is a right pleural effusion, likely with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, though the right hemidiaphragm is also probably elevated. Also again seen is increased retrocardiac density, with air bronchograms. Previously seen small left effusion is significantly smaller or resolved.No new infiltrate or convincing new area of aspiration is identified. There is mild upper zone redistribution and very slight vascular plethora, improved. The partially obscured on the right, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is not appear significantly changed.
