AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The left-sided pacemaker is demonstrated with its biventricular pacer leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle and most likely epicardial vein of the left ventricle. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Lungs are essentially clear with no appreciable pleural effusion. Heart size is enlarged, predominantly the left ventricle.
