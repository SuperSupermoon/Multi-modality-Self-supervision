The patient is status post median sternotomy. Left-sided ICD with single lead terminating in the right ventricle is seen noted. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Rounded calcified structure projecting over the left apex is compatible with a calcified left ventricular aneurysm. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, left greater than right. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
