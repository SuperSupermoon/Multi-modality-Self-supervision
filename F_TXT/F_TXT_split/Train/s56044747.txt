Kyphotic frontal portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of an endotracheal tube, the tip of which is located at least 1.5 cm from the level of the carina. Lung volumes are decreased from prior but remain within normal limits. The lungs show unchanged perihilar opacity likely the residual of improving pulmonary edema. The pleural surfaces are normal. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are normal.
