Interval progression of bilateral airspace process, left greater than right, with associated bilateral pleural effusions superimposed on known emphysema. These findings are consistent with moderate to severe pulmonary edema, less likely an acute infectious process. Clinical correlation is advised. Right internal jugular large bore introducer is unchanged in position. Cardiomediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to the diffuse airspace process. No pneumothorax.
