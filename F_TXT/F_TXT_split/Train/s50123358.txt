There is no visible pneumothorax. The right chest tube is in unchanged position. The endotracheal tube, the right jugular line and the NG tube are stable. The right lung base is better aerated. Stability of the left mild pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis. Stability of the mild right pleural thickening at the base, probably compatible with a hemothorax secondary to rib fractures. The mediastinal and cardiac contours are unchanged.
