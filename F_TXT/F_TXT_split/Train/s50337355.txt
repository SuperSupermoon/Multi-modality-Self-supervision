Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ at ___ p.m., read in conjunction with chest CTA performed at 00:43 on ___. 23:09, the endoscope is been removed. ET tube still ends at the upper margin of the clavicles, 4 or 5 above standard placement. 3 left thoracostomy tubes are unchanged in position. Left lung is still collapsed and a large left hemo thorax remains. The left pneumothorax is underestimated by this study. Small right pneumothorax, largely apical lateral, persists, perhaps because the right thoracostomy tube is fissural.
