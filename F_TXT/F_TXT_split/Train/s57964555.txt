ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carinal. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right PICC line tip is in the right atrium, and might be pulled back approximately 2 cm. Multifocal consolidations appear to be slightly more pronounced than on the previous study. There is right pleural effusion demonstrated. There is no pneumothorax. Multiple cavitated nodules are better appreciated on the recent chest CT but some of them still can be seen on the current examination.
