In comparison with the study of7/1, there is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. The degree of pleural effusions have somewhat decreased, especially on the left. It is unclear whether this merely reflects a more upright position of the patient. The other monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
