As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increased lung volume on the right, associated with a decrease in extent of the pre-existing pleural effusion and subsequent atelectasis. However, moderate cardiomegaly is still present and rather extensive areas of atelectatic lung portions at the lung bases are unchanged. Moderate peribronchial cuffing at the level of the hilar structures could suggest mild interstitial fluid overload. No pneumothorax.
