The right-sided PIC line terminates in the right atrium, however the tip is better delineated on this exam compared to the exam this morning. The left-sided chest tube abuts the mediastinum. There has been no change in the large left-sided pleural effusion compared to the study from earlier this morning. The moderate right-sided pleural effusion also appears stable compared to the exam from the same morning. Mild bibasilar atelectasis is also unchanged. There are no focal consolidations. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinal contours are otherwise normal.
