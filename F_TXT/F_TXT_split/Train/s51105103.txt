Again seen is a dual-lead pacemaker, moderate cardiomegaly, sternal wires, mediastinal clips, patchy areas of volume loss and bilateral small effusions, small pulmonary vascular redistribution. Compared to the study from five days prior, the effusions are slightly smaller and the aeration of the right lower lung is slightly larger, but the vascular plethora is more pronounced. The overall impression is that of persistent CHF.
