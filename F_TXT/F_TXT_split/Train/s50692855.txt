The lungs are normally expanded. Hazy opacification throughout the lungs and some interstitial/Kerley B lines, particularly at the periphery of the left lung suggest pulmonary edema. The heart is top normal, although exaggerated by AP technique. The mediastinal and hilar contours are partially obscured, but thickening of the right paratracheal stripe is due to venous engorgement or adenopathy. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
