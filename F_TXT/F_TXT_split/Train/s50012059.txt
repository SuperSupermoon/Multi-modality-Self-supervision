Supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction without evidence of pneumothorax. In the interval since the prior study, there has been mild increase in pulmonary edema. Indistinctness of the hila has increased. Bibasilar opacities likely relate to pulmonary edema though again underlying infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion.
