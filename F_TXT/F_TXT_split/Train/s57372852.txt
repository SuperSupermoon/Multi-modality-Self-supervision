There has been interval placement of an endogastric tube which is coiled in the mid esophagus and travels back up. A rectangular electronic device projects over the left chest and is unchanged in position compared to ___. Clips in the lower mediastinum/epigastrium are unchanged. The heart size is stably enlarged, particularly a double contour over the right heart is suggestive of a large left atrium. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The lungs continue to demonstrate a nodular opacity in the right base for which reimaging with nipple markers may be considered. A nodular opacity in the left lower lateral lung is unchanged and could represent a nipple shadow.
