Prominence of the right hilum corresponds to the known right lower lobe lesion, as seen on prior chest CT. The cardiomediastinal and left hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs are well-expanded with hazy opacity at the right lung base, likely post procedural. Gaseous distension of the stomach is noted. The visualized portion of the upper abdomen is otherwise unremarkable.
