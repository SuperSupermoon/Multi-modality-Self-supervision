Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in standard position. Marked leftward patient rotation limits assessment of cardiomediastinal contours. Apparent enlarging moderate left pleural effusion is difficult to assess considering the degree of rotation, and is associated with adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis. Apparent improvement in right lower lobe atelectasis and slight decrease in small right effusion. Improved positioning at next short term interval followup is recommended to allow more accurate comparison to previous studies.
