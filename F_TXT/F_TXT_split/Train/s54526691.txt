In comparison with study of ___, the central catheter extends well into the right atrium. There is increasing opacification at the left base in the retrocardiac region, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and small pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged without evidence of vascular congestion. Although no acute focal pneumonia is appreciated, in the appropriate clinical setting this would be difficult to unequivocally exclude in the absence of a lateral view to evaluate the retrocardiac region.
