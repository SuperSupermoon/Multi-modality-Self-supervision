As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube is now better visible. The tip projects over the very proximal parts of the stomach and the tube is coiled in the stomach. The course of the tube is otherwise unremarkable. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The appearance of the lung parenchyma, the cardiac silhouette and the mediastinal structures is unchanged.
