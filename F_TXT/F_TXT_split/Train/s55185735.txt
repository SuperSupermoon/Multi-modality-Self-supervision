A trauma board slightly limits evaluation of this radiograph. Lung volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature. There is minimal bilateral lower lung atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. There are no definite pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. The heart is normal in size. Apparent widening of the superior mediastinum relates to mediastinal fat, as seen on subsequent CT.
