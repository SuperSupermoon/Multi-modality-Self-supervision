Configuration of the Swan-Ganz catheter is consistent either with looping in the main pulmonary artery or left pulmonary artery. Lateral view would be necessary for differentiation. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged but there has been no change in the mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and interstitial abnormality, or in small right pleural effusion since ___. New right jugular line ends in the low SVC. Transvenous biventricular pacer defibrillator leads unchanged in their respective positions. No pneumothorax. Left pleural effusion is small if any.
