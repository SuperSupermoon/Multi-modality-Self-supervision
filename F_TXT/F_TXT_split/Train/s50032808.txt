Exclusion of lung apices limits evaluation for apical pneumothorax. With this limitation in mind, no gross pneumothorax is evident. Endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina, nasogastric tube is coiled within the esophagus with distal tip directed cephalad at approximately the T8 vertebral body level, and this finding has been communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ on ___ at 9 a.m. at the time of discovery. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Bilateral, asymmetrically distributed predominantly perihilar airspace opacities are again demonstrated, worse on the right than the left. Since ___, the right-sided opacities have slightly improved, and the left have worsened. Differential diagnosis includes aspiration pneumonia (given history of seizure) and asymmetrical pulmonary edema.
