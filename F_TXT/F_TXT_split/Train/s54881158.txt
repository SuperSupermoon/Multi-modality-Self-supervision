Left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is seen terminating at the lower SVC. There has been significant interval decrease in bilateral perihilar opacities consistent with significant interval improvement in pulmonary edema. A right ___/infrahilar opacity persists which may be due to pneumonia. There is a small left pleural effusion. The right pleural effusion seems to have essentially resolved. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
