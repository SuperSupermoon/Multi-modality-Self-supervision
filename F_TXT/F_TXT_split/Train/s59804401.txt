Again seen is a left-sided chest tube and pigtail catheter. Compared to the prior film, the pigtail catheter may have retracted slightly. Also again seen is extensive subcutaneous emphysema over the over the left chest. Possibility of a small left apical pneumothorax would be difficult to exclude in this setting, though no obvious change is identified. There is minimal atelectasis at the left base, similar to prior. No gross left effusion. Again seen is relative lucency at the right lung base which could reflect bullous change. Platelike atelectasis in the right mid zone versus fluid in the minor fissure again noted. Trace blunting of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the prior. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
