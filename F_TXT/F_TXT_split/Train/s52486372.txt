Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality improved substantially between ___ and ___ and lung volumes improved as well. Findings row most consistent with resolving pulmonary edema or transient noncardiogenic edema. Today, lung volumes are much lower, widespread pulmonary opacification is worse, although exaggerated by the lower lung volumes, and moderate bilateral pleural effusions have increased. It is impossible to separate pneumonia from cardiogenic and non cardiogenic edema, but since there is pleural effusion and previous abnormalities improved over just 48 hr, I would suggest treating for cardiogenic pulmonary edema first the for concluding that the patient has either ARDS or pneumonia, although aspiration is a prime consideration and could cause either. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements and an esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. There is no pneumothorax.
