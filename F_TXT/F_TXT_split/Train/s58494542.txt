There has been interval placement of a right apical chest tube. Previously noted small right apical pneumothorax is not clearly visualized on the current radiograph. There is persistent pneumomediastinum and extensive amount of subcutaneous emphysema within the chest wall bilaterally extending into the neck. Curvilinear lucency in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen is compatible with retroperitoneal subcutaneous emphysema, as seen on the previous CT. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Lungs remain hyperinflated. Minimal patchy right basilar opacity likely reflects a small contusion. Right posterior tenth rib fracture is re- demonstrated.
