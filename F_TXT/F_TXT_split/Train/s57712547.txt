Moderate bilateral pleural effusions have probably increased since ___, responsible for greater atelectasis at the lung bases, and obscuring the left heart border. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is probably stable. There is no pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is more engorged, but I see little evidence of pulmonary edema. Right jugular temporary pacer lead passes as far as the floor of the proximal right ventricle. No pneumothorax.
