One transesophageal drainage tube ends in the mid portion of the nondistended stomach. Another ends at the diaphragm. Lung apices excluded from this examination. No endotracheal tube is seen below the level of the aortic knob, the upper margin of this image. Severe left lower lobe atelectasis and moderate left pleural effusion have not improved. Mild interstitial edema in the right lung is stable. The heart is mildly enlarged. An apparent right sided vascular catheter projects over the axilla and upper chest, if it is a vascular line it does not reach central vein. Any apical pneumothorax would not be appreciated.
