There is stable marked cardiac enlargement. Lung volumes remain relatively low with crowding of the vasculature. However, the previously seen mild interstitial edema has essentially resolved. No focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Probable blunting of the left costophrenic angle with adjacent patchy opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis in the setting of a small pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
