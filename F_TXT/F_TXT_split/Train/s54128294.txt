As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is still intubated. The position of the endotracheal tube is unchanged. The tip of the tube projects approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. In the interval, the nasogastric tube has been removed. Moderate cardiomegaly persists but blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, likely caused by a pre-existing small left pleural effusion, has almost completely resolved. Mild fluid overload. Improved ventilation at the left and right lung base.
