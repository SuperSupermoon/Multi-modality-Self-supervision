Comparison is made to previous study from ___ at 4:00 a.m. The tip of the endotracheal tube is 2.6 cm above the carina. There is a feeding tube with tip and side port in the stomach. There is a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the right atrium. This could be pulled back, 3-4 cm for more optimal placement. There are very low lung volumes with atelectasis versus developing infiltrates at the lung bases. There are no pneumothoraces.
