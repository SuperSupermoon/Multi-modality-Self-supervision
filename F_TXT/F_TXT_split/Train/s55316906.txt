In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly improved lung volumes. The endotracheal tube tip is approximately 5 cm above the carina and the nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. Retrocardiac opacification again is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiomegaly persists.
