Interval placement of endotracheal tube, with the tip terminating 2.3 cm above the carina with the neck in a flexed position. Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Stable cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration of the heart. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by mild edema. Worsening right lower lobe and new left lower lobe opacities may be due to a combination of atelectasis, aspiration and potentially infectious pneumonia.
