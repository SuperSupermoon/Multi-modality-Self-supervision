Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. Since prior radiograph, there has been slight additional accumulation of right, loculated pleural effusion with sparing of the lower lung and effusion distributed along the fissure. There is note of definitive pneumothorax. Left base area of atelectasis is unchanged. The loculated air collection projecting over the right lower quadrant can potentially reflect air within the peritoneum thus reflecting pneumoperitoneum. To answer this question, decubitus image is required. It also potentially may reflect aerated lung projecting above the diaphragm. Additional air bubble projecting over the right upper quadrant might reflect free air versus air within the colon.
