Taking into account rotation to the right on the current study, radiographic appearance of the heart and mediastinal contours and lungs is not significantly different. Radio opacity in the left infrahilar region is somewhat less apparent than on the most recent previous study and no new central pulmonary vascular congestion or focal consolidation is seen. No rib fracture is seen.
