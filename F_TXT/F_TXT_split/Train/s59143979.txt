Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier. New ET tube is in standard position; the tip is 4.7 cm above the carina. There is improvement of the aeration of the lower lobes bilaterally likely due to mechanical ventilation and better expansion of the lungs. There are persistent perihilar bilateral opacities, minimally improved from prior consistent with improvement in the component of pulmonary edema superimposed on aspiration process. There is a small right pleural effusion. Right Port-A-Cath and right chest tube remain in place in unchanged position.
