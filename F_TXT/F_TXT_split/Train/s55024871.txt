AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube is too high, at the level of the thoracic inlet and should be advanced at least 4 cm. It is currently approximately 9 cm above the carina. The left lung continues to be predominantly atelectatic. Right lung overall is clear, but there is some degree of vascular engorgement which also potentially may reflect the shift of the blood pool from the atelectatic left lung.
