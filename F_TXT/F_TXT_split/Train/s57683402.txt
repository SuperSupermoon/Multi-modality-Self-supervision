Single erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The lungs remain hyperinflated, flattening in the diaphragms, consistent with COPD. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
