The right PICC tip projects over the upper SVC. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours unchanged from the prior examination. The tracheostomy tube is noted to be aligned perpendicular with respect to the trachea. Increased opacification at the left lung base likely represents pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis; however, pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical setting. Additionally, retrocardiac opacification may represent layering pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis; however, infectious process such as pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical setting. Minimal right-sided pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Minimal opacification of the right lung base may represent atelectasis. IMPRESSION; 1. The tracheostomy tube is noted to be aligned perpendicular with respect to the trachea. The position needs to be re-evaluated. Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 14:21 on ___ via telephone. 2. Retrocardiac opacification is again noted which may represent layering pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis; however, infectious process such as pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
