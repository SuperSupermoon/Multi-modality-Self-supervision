Surgical ___ project over the left axilla and mediastinum. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There is a heterogeneous, ill-defined focal opacity in the right mid to lower lung partially obscuring the right heart border. Air bronchograms are also seen in the right mid to lower lung. Homogeneous retrocardiac opacity partially obscuring the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with left lower lobe collapse. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
