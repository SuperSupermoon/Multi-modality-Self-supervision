There is little interval change from the prior study. The heart size is within normal limits. The aorta remains markedly tortuous. Superior mediastinum remains widened, which on the prior chest CT from ___ is attributable to mediastinal fat and vessels. Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. There is subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung base. Mild elevation of left hemidiaphragm appears unchanged. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No areas of focal consolidation are demonstrated. There are no acutely displaced rib fractures visualized.
