Left chest tube remains in place. Left sixth posterior lateral displaced rib fracture. No large pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-upright technique. There is a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral chest wall soft tissues. There is improved aeration of the right base, although increasing retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. The vasculature is somewhat prominent, but no overt pulmonary edema is seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable status post median sternotomy.
