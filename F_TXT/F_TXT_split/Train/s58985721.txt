There is cephalization of pulmonary vessels, with perihilar haziness, vascular indistinctness consistent with moderate pulmonary edema, worsened since prior exam. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. Bibasilar opacities are noted, which likely represent atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is obscured by the pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Sternotomy wires, CABG clips, and cholecystectomy clips are noted.
