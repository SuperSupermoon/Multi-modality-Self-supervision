After insertion of a new left basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter, left pleural effusion has resolved. No left pneumothorax. Elevation of the right lung base is probably due to persistent subpulmonic right pleural effusion, and some right pleural fluid layers either posteriorly or in the right major fissure, with no improvement since ___. Right thoracostomy tube reaches the midline, and a smaller, laterally positioned pigtail drainage catheter are unchanged in their positions in the right hemithorax. A small pneumothorax at the right base has increased. Heart is normal size. A large cervicothoracic mass, usually thyroid, displaces the trachea markedly to the left and narrows it appreciably, but there has been no recent change.
