Portable supine chest radiograph is obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina and should not be advanced any further. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of view. Diffuse predominantly perihilar bilateral hazy opacities accompanied by septal thickening are compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. Left retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis as it improves on the subsequent image. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Heart size is normal.
