Overall, the tip of the endotracheal tube is seen to be in a similar position to the prior study, perhaps advanceed by 1 cm, located approximately 4 cm above the carina. NG tube is present, with the tip and side hole within the stomach. There are no focal pulmonary opacities, pleural effusions, or evidence of pneumothorax.
