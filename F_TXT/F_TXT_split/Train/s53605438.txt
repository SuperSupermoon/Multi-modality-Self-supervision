1. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stably enlarged cardiac contours. There is likely a layering left effusion with associated airspace opacity which most likely reflects partial lower lobe atelectasis, although an acute infectious process cannot be excluded. There continues to be diffuse bilateral airspace process which is slightly improved since the prior study, favoring resolving but persistent moderate pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip within the stomach. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
