Rotated positioning. There are low inspiratory volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged. Again seen is increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Equivocal small effusion. There is patchy opacity at the right base, similar to the prior film. No gross right effusion. Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, minimally improved.
