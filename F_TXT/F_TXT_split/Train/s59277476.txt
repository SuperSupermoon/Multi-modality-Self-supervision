Right subclavian PICC line, right carotid vascular stent and tracheostomy tube unchanged in position. The tracheostomy tube continues to have its tip approximately 1.5 cm above the carina. Surgical clips are again seen overlying the right axilla and right hilar region in this patient status post reconstructive surgery. There are layering bilateral effusions with stable retrocardiac consolidation and patchy opacity at the right base likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
