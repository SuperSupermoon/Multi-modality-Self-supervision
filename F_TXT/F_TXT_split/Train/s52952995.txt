As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach. No evidence of complications. The vertebral stabilization devices are unchanged. Also unchanged is the borderline size of the cardiac silhouette and the evidence of bilateral mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. The presence of minimal pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
