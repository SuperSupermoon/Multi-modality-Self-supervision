In comparison to the prior radiograph, a single semi-erect portable view of the chest demonstrates significantly lower lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities are most consistent with atelectasis, although in the correct clinical setting, pneumonia could certainly be considered. There are possible small bilateral pleural effusions. Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Cardiac size is exaggerated by the AP view as well as the lower lung volumes but given these appears relatively stable. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present, with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No pneumothorax. Heterotopic ossification is again noted along the inferior margin of the right glenoid.
