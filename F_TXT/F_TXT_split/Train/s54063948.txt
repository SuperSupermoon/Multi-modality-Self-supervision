Interval placement of a left PICC line, probably terminating within the lower SVC. Evaluation is partially limited by extensive spinal fusion hardware placement. The lung volumes are noted to be low, with resultant crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema identified. The heart size is top-normal. The mediastinal contours are stable.
