As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged position of the left PICC line. Minimal scarring at the right lung bases persists but no evidence of new focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia are visualized. No pleural effusions.
