Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The tubes and lines are in unchanged position. The right basal opacity appears to be improved. The left basal opacity is unchanged, thus if the aspiration event has been present, it appears to be either minor or it has been present before, resolving. No interval increase in pleural effusion or development of pneumothorax is noted.
