There has been interval placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter. The tip is in a lobe were branch of the right pulmonary artery, either the right middle or right lower lobe. This could be withdrawn for better positioning within the right main pulmonary artery. The lung volumes are essentially unchanged. Minimal left basilar atelectasis. No consolidation or pneumothorax seen. No pleural effusion seen.
