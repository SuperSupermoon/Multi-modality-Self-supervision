As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal and there are areas of atelectasis both at the right and the left lung bases, more severe on the left. However, the appearance of the lung parenchyma at the lung bases is otherwise unremarkable, there are no typically radiographically signs suggesting aspiration. Moderate elongation of the descending aorta. No pneumothorax. Healed right-sided rib fractures. Part of a right mandibular fixation device is visualized.
