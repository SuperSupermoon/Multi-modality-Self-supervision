Small left pleural effusion has decreased since ___, but I see no pleural drainage catheter, and no evidence of pneumothorax. Multiple bile fractures are recently stable in terms of angulation and distraction, most severe on the right. Left lower lobe remains largely atelectatic. Heart size is normal. Right pleural drain ends in the posterior sulcus impinging on the midline. Small right pleural effusion persists. There is no substantial right pleural air collection. Nasogastric tube ends in the distal part of a nondistended stomach. No endotracheal tube is seen below ET tube, the upper margin of this examination.
