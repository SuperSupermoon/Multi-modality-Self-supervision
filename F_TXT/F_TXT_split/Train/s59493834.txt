Compared with ___, retrocardiac opacity with may have increased slightly, consistent with increased left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is also slight blunting of left costophrenic angle which is more pronounced and could reflect an accumulating small left pleural effusion. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is similar to the prior study. There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. Previously seen vascular plethora is slightly improved. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Known left-sided rib fractures are not well visualized sclerotic density overlying the T12 or L1 vertebral body could reflect prior vertebroplasty.
