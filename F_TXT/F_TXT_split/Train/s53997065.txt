The ECMO catheter is unchanged in position as is the Dobhoff tube. The tip of the endotracheal tube is difficult to localize precisely but appears to be approximately 6 cm proximal to the carina. A left-sided subclavian line terminates in the mid SVC. There are bilateral hazy opacities at the bases most consistent with pleural effusions. In addition there is right lower lobe collapse, consolidation cannot be excluded. Linear atelectasis noted in the left mid lung at the site of the previous chest strain insertion, the chest drain has been removed. No pneumothorax seen.
