Tracheostomy catheter and right approach PICC are in unchanged expected position. A generator overlies the left chest wall, unchanged from prior. There has been interval re-expansion of the right middle and bilateral lower lobes since most recent prior. Mild atelectasis persists at the right base, though overall aeration is much improved. Lung volumes remain low exaggerating bronchovascular markings, though there is probable mild pulmonary edema, though no large effusions. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits given the portable supine technique of the film.
