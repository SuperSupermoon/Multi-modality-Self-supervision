Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. The left subclavian central line is unchanged in position. Hardware again overlies the upper thoracic spine. There is persistent retrocardiac consolidation, although aeration has slightly improved in this vicinity. Interval development of focal opacity in the left upper lung which may represent partial upper lobe collapse due to decreased inspiration, although the differential would also include aspiration or pulmonary hemorrhage (in the setting of a recent line attempt.) This can be better assessed on followup imaging. The right lung remains grossly clear. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Heart remains unchanged in contour. No pneumothorax.
