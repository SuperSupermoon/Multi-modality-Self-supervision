An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm to overlie the proximal stomach. Probable focal underpenetration accounting for focal poor visualization of the 2 in the region of the GE junction. Inspiratory volumes are low. Mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette likely relates to low inspiratory volumes. There is minimal atelectasis. No CHF, frank consolidation or gross effusion is identified.
