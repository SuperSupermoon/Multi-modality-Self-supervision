Small right pneumothorax, barely visible on this examination, and not to be confused with prominent skin folds, is probably unchanged since the chest CT scan. Left lung is clear. Right infrahilar atelectasis mild, but increased since earlier in the day. There is no appreciable pleural abnormality. Heart size is normal. Thoracic aorta is generally large and tortuous but not focally aneurysmal.
