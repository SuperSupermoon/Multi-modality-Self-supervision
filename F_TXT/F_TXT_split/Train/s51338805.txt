Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Mediastinal surgical clips are seen. There is also evidence of a coronary artery stent. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. Opacity projecting over the left costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissue and cardiac silhouette, although a small pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no definite consolidation or evidence of pneumothorax. Mediastinal contours are stable.
