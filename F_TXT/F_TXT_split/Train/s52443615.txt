1. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm and the tip projects over the expected location of the stomach. Lung volumes are reduced and there are now patchy bibasilar opacities most likely reflecting atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal limits given lordotic technique and patient positioning.
