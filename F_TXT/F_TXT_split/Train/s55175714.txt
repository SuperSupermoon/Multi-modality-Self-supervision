The Dobbhoff tube loops across the upper abdomen, with the radiopaque portion lying in the region of the distal duodenum/proximal jejunum. Gas is noted in non-dilated transverse colon. Note is made of marked cardiomegaly, with sternal wires; bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation; and probable CHF. The lung apices are excluded from this film.
