A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. A new right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC. The left Port-A-Cath ends in the mid SVC. Lung volumes are lower than on the prior study with bibasilar atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion appears present. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are stable allowing for patient position and technique.Percutaneous gastrostomy tube is partially imaged. Right upper quadrant calcifications likely reflect gallstones.
