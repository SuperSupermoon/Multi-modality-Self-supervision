AP portable semi upright view of the chest. A tracheostomy tube projects over the superior mediastinum. A left upper extremity PICC line is seen with its tip again seen projecting over the aortic knob likely in the left distal brachiocephalic vein. Calcified mass projecting over the right lower lung is unchanged from multiple prior imaging studies and has been previously better characterized on chest CT as sequelae of prior empyema or hemothorax. No convincing evidence for pneumonia or edema. No large effusion is seen. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Bony structures are intact.
