A new pigtail catheter has been inserted into the left hemithorax with a substantial decrease in a left-sided pleural effusion although much of the left hemithorax remains opacified with pleural effusion and atelectasis involving much of the left lung. Rightward shift has somewhat reduced. A few small foci of air in the left hemithorax are not unanticipated after chest tube placement. On the right, there is a right basilar opacity worrisome for pneumonia, similar to increased, although not definitely changed allowing for substantial differences in technique. A small pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on the right. A Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava.
