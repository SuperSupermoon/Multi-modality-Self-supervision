An endotracheal tube has been placed with the tip terminating just below the thoracic inlet 3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. The patient is slightly rotated. The inspiratory lung volumes remain low. No significant focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The pulmonary vasculature is slightly indistinct, suggesting interval mild pulmonary vascular congestion. A calcified granuloma is re- demonstrated in the right lung base and right lung apex. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal contours are slightly prominent related to unfolding of the thoracic aorta.
