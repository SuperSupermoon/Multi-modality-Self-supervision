AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. On the previous examination, a right-sided PICC line was identified and seen to terminate overlying the mid portion of the right atrium. Withdrawal of the line by 4 cm was recommended, but no followup examination obtained. The present examination obtained five days later demonstrates the presence of a right-sided PICC line presumably identical with the previous one. Termination point has changed and is now located 3 cm below the level of the carina which indicates the lower portion of the SVC, but safely above the expected entrance into the right atrium. These findings are unaltered, status post sternotomy and bypass surgery with moderate cardiac enlargement. No pneumothorax identified.
