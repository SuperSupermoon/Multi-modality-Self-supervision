The ___ radiograph shows interval placement of a right apical pigtail catheter with re-expansion of the right lung. Only a tiny right apical pneumothorax remains. The right PICC line is unchanged in position, ending in the low SVC. There is no appreciable interval change in widespread interstitial and airspace opacities. Small to moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits despite the projection. The followup radiograph from ___ shows interval decrease in the tiny right apical pneumothorax. The right apical pigtail catheter and right PICC line are unchanged in position. Diffuse airspace opacities have worsened, particularly in the right upper lung, which may be due to worsening infection or re-expansion pulmonary edema. Otherwise, there is no additional interval change.
