The heart is borderline enlarged with a relatively rounded contour. There is moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta. The aortic arch appears calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable within the limitations of technique. There are small pleural effusions, probably greater on the left than right, with patchy lower lung opacities likely attributable to associated atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate-to-severe leftward convex curvature is centered along the lower thoracic spine.
