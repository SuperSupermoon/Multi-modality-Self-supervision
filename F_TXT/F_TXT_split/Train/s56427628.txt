Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. A dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads in the expected position of the right atrium and right ventricle. There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Bibasilar, left greater than right opacities may be due to atelectasis, although aspiration or infection are also possibilities. Patchy medial right upper lobe opacity may relate to overlapping structures with anterior right first rib, although underlying consolidation from aspiration not excluded. There is prominence of the central vasculature consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The aorta is calcified.
