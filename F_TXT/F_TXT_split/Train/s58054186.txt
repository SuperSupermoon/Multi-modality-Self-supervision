In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases persist, and there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and some evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. More focal opacification is seen in the right mid and upper zone. This could represent areas of consolidation, though a portion of the mid right lung is obscured by overlying material.
