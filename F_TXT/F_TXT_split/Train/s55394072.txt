Comparison is made with prior study ___. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable. Left basal pigtail catheter remains in place. There is no pneumothorax. This probably leads to the very small left pleural effusion. Biapical and right mid lung opacities have improved on the right upper lobe. Lines and tubes are in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with moderate cardiomegaly.
