AP chest compared to ___ and ___. Bilateral upper lobe consolidation is slightly more pronounced today than yesterday. Whether this is due to progression of pneumonia or deposition of early edema in a region of pre-existing pneumonia is difficult to say since the mediastinal veins are dilated in the supine position. Heart size is top normal, and there may be mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, but no clear edema elsewhere. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
