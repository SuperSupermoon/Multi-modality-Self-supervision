AP chest compared to 7:12 p.m.: Newly placed endotracheal tube abuts the left lateral wall of the trachea. This should be evaluated clinically to see if appropriately positioned. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach but would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction. The postoperative right lung previously completely collapsed is now minimally aerated, only slightly decreasing the large persistent right pleural space, almost entirely air filled. Right basal pleural tube unchanged in position. Left lung grossly clear. Heart size normal.
