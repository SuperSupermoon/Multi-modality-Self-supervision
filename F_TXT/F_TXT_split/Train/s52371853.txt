Single frontal portable view of the chest was obtained. The lung apices are excluded on this study and overlying trauma board prevents detailed evaluation of the chest. The heart size and bronchovascular markings are exaggerated by low lung volumes. No focal consolidation is present. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube terminates 7 mm from the carina. NG tube terminates with side port in the stomach and its tip to the right of the midline.
