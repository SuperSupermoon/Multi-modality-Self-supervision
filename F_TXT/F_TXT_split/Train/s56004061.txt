As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right-sided internal jugular vein catheter. The tip of the catheter projects over the mid SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, unchanged monitoring and support devices, unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions.
