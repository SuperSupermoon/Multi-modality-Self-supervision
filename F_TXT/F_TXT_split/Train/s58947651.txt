Portable view of the chest demonstrates a nearly resolved left pleural effusion. There is no left-sided pneumothorax. The right medial hemidiaphragm is newly obscured, likely reflecting a mild reaccumulation of pleural fluid and associated atelectasis, when compared to radiograph from 13:30. There remains a probable loculated right basilar hydropneumothorax. The lungs are grossly clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
