Since the prior radiograph of several hr earlier, a nasogastric tube has been replaced or repositioned, now extending into the stomach, with tip of the tube outside of the field of view of this radiograph. Endotracheal tube has also been apparently repositioned, now terminating 3.7 cm above the carinal. No other relevant changes since the recent study.
