Left subclavian central line has its tip in the proximal SVC, unchanged. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. An endotracheal tube is unchanged in position with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. The cardiac and mediastinal contours appear to have increased since the prior study, but this is felt to be related to the patient rotation on the current examination given that the contour is more similar to that seen on ___. 4-mm calcified nodular opacity in the right mid lung adjacent to the horizontal fissure is again seen, likely reflecting a granuloma. Lung volumes remain low with no evidence of overt pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. No focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
