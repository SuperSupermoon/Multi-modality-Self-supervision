Tip of the endotracheal tube is about a cm from the carina with the chain elevated. It should be withdrawn 2.5 cm to prevent unilateral intubation. Esophageal drainage tube ends in the upper portion of a nondistended stomach. Left PIC line ends alongside the right jugular lead, close to the superior cavoatrial junction. Lung bases are elevated, due in part to significant subpulmonic pleural effusion, and atelectasis. The heart is mildly enlarged. Enlargement of the right pulmonary artery is probably vascular, more prominent today than on ___.
