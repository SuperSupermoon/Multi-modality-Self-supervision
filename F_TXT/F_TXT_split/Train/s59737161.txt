In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal and nasogastric tube and right IJ catheter have been removed. Left chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Opacification at the left base probably represents the known elevation of the left hemi diaphragmatic contour with possible mild effusion and atelectatic changes. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
