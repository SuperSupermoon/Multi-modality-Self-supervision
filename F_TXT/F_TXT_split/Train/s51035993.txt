Bilateral lung volumes remain persistently low with bibasal opacities, left side more than right, which is likely atelectasis. However, on the single frontal view, differentiation betweeen atelectasis and pneumonia is difficult, and should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical history. Mildly increased haziness of the lungs with indistinct vascular margins and perihilar haze is likely pulmonary edema, which appears mild to moderate. Given low lung volumes, severity of pulmonary edema may be exaggerated. Bilateral pleural effusions are small and unchanged. Heart size is normal.
