Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard position, but note is made of apparent slight overdistention of the cuff of the endotracheal tube. Heart size remains normal. Diffuse hazy opacities probably reflect layering pleural effusions on the semi-upright study. Persistent left retrocardiac opacity, most likely atelectasis.
