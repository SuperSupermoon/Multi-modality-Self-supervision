There has been little interval change from the prior exam. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain unchanged. There is persistent mild pulmonary edema with streaky bibasilar atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions demonstrated on the previous exam are not well assessed on the current frontal view. There is no pneumothorax.
