AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 6:40 p.m.: Small right pneumothorax, predominantly apical, and small-to-moderate left pneumothorax both apicocostal and probably anterior have not changed since ___. Left lower lobe atelectasis has improved. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Subcutaneous emphysema has increased in the left chest wall, presumably along the course of the pleural drainage catheter which ends alongside the mediastinal drain at the level of the clavicles and a right pleural tube extending more superiorly. A drainage tube ends in the upper stomach, and a feeding tube passes beyond the drainage tube into the distal stomach. Heart size mildly enlarged, acutely unchanged.
