As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Low lung volumes, unchanged monitoring and support devices. Mild cardiomegaly with bilateral areas of basal atelectasis. Minimal fluid overload cannot be excluded. No larger pleural effusions. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities. Again noted is the proximity of the endotracheal tube to the carina. The tube should be pulled back by approximately 1 to 2 cm.
