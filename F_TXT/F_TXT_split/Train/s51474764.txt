AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lungs are low in volume, and the upper lungs are clear. The right lung base medially might be seen dilated vasculature, but the area should be reevaluated with conventional radiographs when feasible. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contour is not, with tubulation, greater on the left than the right. However, given the extent of extrapleural fat deposition, this could be due to fat as well. Any prior chest radiograph should be obtained to see whether this is a chronic or a new finding warranting further investigation. Extensive extrapleural fat should not be mistaken for pleural abnormality.
