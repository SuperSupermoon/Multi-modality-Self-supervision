The patient has been extubated and a right internal jugular catheter and orogastric tube removed. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. The chest is hyperinflated. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. In the right lower lung, there is persistent predominantly streaky opacification, but very similar to the prior study. In the left lower lung, there is an apparent increased opacity, although a confounding factor is that there does seem to be background opacity in the area, but the increase is worrisome for developing pneumonia.
