Since the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, the patient has been intubated, with tip of endotracheal tube terminating 7.5 cm above the carina. This could be advanced a few cm for standard positioning. Postoperative changes are present in the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine, not fully evaluated on this portable chest radiograph. Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Lungs are clear except for new left retrocardiac opacification, likely representing atelectasis or localized aspiration. ___, MD
