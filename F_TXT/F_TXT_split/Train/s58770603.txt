The ET tube terminates at the level of the clavicles. A right subclavian central venous catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. A nasogastric tube enters the stomach, distal tip not visualized. There is no pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low. Small layering left pleural effusion is unchanged. A right basilar airspace opacity with air bronchograms is more prominent today. A left basilar retrocardiac airspace opacity has slightly improved following partial re-expansion of the left lower lobe.
