Moderate right pleural effusion is larger, small left pleural effusion is new, bibasilar consolidation is more severe due to either pneumonia or atelectasis. The large, postoperative mass-effect in the upper mediastinum displacing the trachea to the left is stable, may well be a large hematoma. Small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Right pleural and mediastinal drains are unchanged in their positions and the nasogastric tube ends at the level of the diaphragm.
