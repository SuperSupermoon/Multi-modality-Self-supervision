The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not included on the image but the side-hole projects 3-4 cm be low the gastroesophageal junction, indicating correct tube position. No complications. The pre-existing massive changes in both lungs are constant. The endotracheal tube has been slightly pulled back.
