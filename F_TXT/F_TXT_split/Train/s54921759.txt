There has been interval increase in well large amount opacity projecting over the right hemi thorax with only small amount of aeration seen in the right upper region, possibly due to worsening pleural effusion, consolidation and underlying atelectasis. There has also been interval increase and left base opacity, likely combination of pleural effusion, atelectasis, possibly consolidation. The right aspect of the cardiac silhouette is obscured. Mediastinal contours are grossly stable. No pulmonary edema is seen.
