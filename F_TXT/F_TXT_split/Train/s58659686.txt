As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in visibility of the interstitial lung structures, likely reflecting increased interstitial fluid load. The pleural effusions and the bilateral areas of atelectasis are unchanged in extent and severity. No new parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
