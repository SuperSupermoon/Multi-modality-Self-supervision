There has been a mild improvement in pulmonary edema with otherwise little change overall in comparison to the prior study from yesterday. Again visualized is stable retrocardiac opacity and small left pleural effusion. There is no evidence of new consolidations or pneumothoraces. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains stable and moderately enlarged. Osseous structures are normal.
