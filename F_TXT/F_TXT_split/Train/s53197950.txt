Comparison is made with prior study performed 9 hours earlier. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. ET tube is in standard position. Right PICC tip is difficult to visualize can be followed to the lower SVC. Collapse of the left lung has improved. There is persistent large air collapse or atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are stable. Right lower lobe opacity is a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
