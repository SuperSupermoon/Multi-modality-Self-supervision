As compared to the previous radiograph, the orogastric tube has been exchanged. The current tube shows a normal course, the tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. New mild bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting atelectasis. No other relevant changes.
