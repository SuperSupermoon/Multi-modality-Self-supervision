Tip of endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating about 5 cm above the carina, but the cuff appears slightly overdistended. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance, and are reflective of previous esophagectomy and gastric pull-up procedure. Diffuse heterogeneity of the lungs is predominantly due to known upper lobe predominant emphysema and bibasilar scarring/fibrosis. A subtle superimposed interstitial process is likely, and probably represents mild interstitial edema. Unchanged small left pleural effusion. No visible pneumothorax.
