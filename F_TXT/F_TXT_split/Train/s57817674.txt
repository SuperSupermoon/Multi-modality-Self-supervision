In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is again mildly enlarged and there is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. There is a vague asymmetry of the apical region with increased opacification on the left. This could be a technical artifact, though in the appropriate clinical setting, a developing consolidation would have to be considered. Monitoring and support devices remain in good position.
