There is moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which appears relatively unchanged when compared to prior study. Mild pulmonary edema is noted with vascular indistinctness and perihilar haziness. Additionally, moderate right pleural effusion is demonstrated with associated right basilar opacity likely reflecting atelectasis. Minimal atelectasis in the retrocardiac region is likely present. No pneumothorax is identified. Multiple old right-sided rib fractures are again noted.
