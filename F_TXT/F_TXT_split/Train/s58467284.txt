There are bilateral moderate pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. Overlying infection / aspiration cannot be excluded, particularly at the right lung base. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic arch. The cardiac outline is silhouetted by adjacent pleural effusions. There is mild cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. No acute fractures are identified.
