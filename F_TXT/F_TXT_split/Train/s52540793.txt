A single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a similar study obtained five hours earlier during the same day. It is again noted that the most anterior portion of the first rib has been resected when comparison is made with the preoperative chest examination of ___. On the next preceding portable chest examination, this resection had already been performed. Also unchanged is the appearance of an overlying drainage catheter terminating in an area overlying the most proximal portion of the right clavicle seen on this frontal view. Again, there is no evidence of pneumothorax, similar as on the preceding chest examination obtained four hours earlier.
