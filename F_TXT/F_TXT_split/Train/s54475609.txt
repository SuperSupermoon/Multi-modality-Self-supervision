1. Endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Left internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. There is elevation of the left diaphragm with distended air-filled bowel. There are linear opacities at the left base likely reflecting areas of atelectasis. Patchy opacity at the right base also likely reflects atelectasis. In addition, lung volumes are lower and there is fullness of the perihilar vasculature and prominence of the interstitium which suggests superimposed interstitial edema. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is reduced given semi-supine technique. The aorta remains unfolded, prominent and tortuous.
