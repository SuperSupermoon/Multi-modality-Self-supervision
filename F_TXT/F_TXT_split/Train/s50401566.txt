As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The parenchymal opacities in the left lung increase in severity, likely reflecting decreased ventilation. The right lung volume has also minimally decreased. Overall, changes could be the effect of decreased ventilatory pressure. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
