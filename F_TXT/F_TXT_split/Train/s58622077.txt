Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. A persistent, moderate left pleural effusion appears slightly increased from prior exam although this may be due to positional effect. Persistent low lung volumes and left greater than right atelectasis is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Lungs are otherwise without focal consolidation or evidence of edema. The endotracheal tube appears to have been slightly withdrawn with the tip terminating 7 cm cranial to the carina.
