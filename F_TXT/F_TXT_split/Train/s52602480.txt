AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. There is no significant interval change between these two studies obtained with a ___-hour interval. The left-sided basal density with obscuration of the left-sided diaphragmatic contour persists. This is explained by patient's pancreatitis. No increased pulmonary vascular congestion and no evidence of new parenchymal infiltrates. Right-sided PICC line in place. High contrast image clearly identifies its termination in the lower third of the SVC. A gas-distended stomach can be identified and overlying drainage tubes are seen in the upper abdominal area, however, more detailed analysis of the abdomen can be performed.
