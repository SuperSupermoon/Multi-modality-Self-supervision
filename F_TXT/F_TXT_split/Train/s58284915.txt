Substantially increased opacification at the right lung base is probably a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Less severe left basal consolidation and small left pleural effusion are stable. Pulmonary vascular and mediastinal venous engorgement have developed, and there has been a slight increase in the size of the still normal heart, pointing to biventricular heart failure or volume overload. New tracheostomy tube is midline. No evidence of complications. Right subclavian or PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
