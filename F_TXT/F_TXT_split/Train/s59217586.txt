Portable chest radiograph demonstrates appearance of a widened mediastinum, likely exaggerated by patient rotation; however, may also be due to increased lymphadenopathy. Extensive increased interstitial prominence extending from the right infrahilar region is suggestive of worsening lymphangitic carcinomatosis given. Increased opacifications in the left retrocardiac space as well as mid lung, likely atelectasis, though cannot exclude infectious process. No overt pulmonary edema evident. Interval placement of right-sided chest tube with near resolution of right pleural effusion and development of subcutaneous emphysema. No pneumothorax evident. Small left pleural effusion may be minimally increased compared to prior study.
