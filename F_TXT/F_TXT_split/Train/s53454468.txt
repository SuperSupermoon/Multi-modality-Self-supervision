AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 4:45 p.m.: Moderate-to-large right pneumothorax improved between ___ and ___ and has been stable all day, despite presence of two right pleural tubes ending in the upper hemithorax. Diffuse interstitial abnormality in the right lung is probably edema reflecting continuous negative pressure in the right hemithorax. There is progressive vascular engorgement in the left lung, which suggests early cardiac decompensation on that side. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged, both postoperatively and compared to preoperative appearance on ___, there is no appreciable pleural effusion or mediastinal venous engorgement. Left subclavian infusion port catheter ends at the origin of the SVC. Rightward mediastinal shift and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm reflects lobar resection.
