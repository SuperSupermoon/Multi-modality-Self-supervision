Lung volumes remain low with bilateral basal airspace opacities. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions. The mediastinum appears widened but unchanged compared to the prior studies. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with diffuse faint nodular opacities likely reflecting pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax seen.
