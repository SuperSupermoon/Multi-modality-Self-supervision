The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged, with widening of the mediastinum attributable to mediastinal lipomatosis and presence of an aberrant right subclavian artery. Pulmonary vascularity is slightly prominent, unchanged, and the hilar contours are unremarkable. Paraseptal emphysematous changes are re- demonstrated within the lung apices. Previously noted right lower lobe nodular opacities as noted on the chest CT are not clearly seen on the current exam. No new areas of focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
