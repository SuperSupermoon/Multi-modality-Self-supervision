Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. Vascular pedicle and azygos vein are distended, in conjunction with pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate combined alveolar and interstitial pulmonary edema. Additional patchy and linear opacities at the bases probably represent atelectasis, although coexisting dependent edema and/or aspiration are also possible. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
