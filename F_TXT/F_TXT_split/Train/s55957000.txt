Heart size is normal with mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Indistinct, primarily peribronchovascular opacity at the right lung base is re- demonstrated, but with slightly changed morphology. Lungs are otherwise clear. Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
