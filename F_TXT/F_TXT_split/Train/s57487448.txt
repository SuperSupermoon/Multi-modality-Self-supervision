Interval improvement in extent of subcutaneous emphysema. Right chest tube remains in place, and known small right basilar pneumothorax shown on CT of ___ is not well demonstrated radiographically. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Bibasilar atelectasis appears slightly worse in the left lower lobe compared to the prior study. Small bilateral pleural effusions are again demonstrated.
