Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There has been placement of a left-sided IJ catheter with distal lead tip in the distal SVC. There is cardiomegaly which is stable. There has been development of prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of fluid overload. There is also development of a left retrocardiac opacity since the previous study. This may be due to a combination of atelectasis, pleural fluid or infiltrate.
