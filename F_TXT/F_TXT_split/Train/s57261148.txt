As compared to the previous radiograph, a pigtail catheter has been inserted into loculated pre-existing left pleural effusion. The extent of the fluid in the pleural space on the left has dramatically decreased. Fluid is now seen only projecting over the left costophrenic sinus. There is a mild degree of reexpansion edema, notably surrounding the left heart border. No evidence of pneumothorax. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema. Normal appearance of the right hemithorax. Potential insertion of a right internal jugular vein catheter that should be confirmed on subsequent radiograph.
