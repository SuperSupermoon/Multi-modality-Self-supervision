As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are constant. The lung volumes have slightly decreased, which might be an effect of changed ventilatory pressure. The extent and severity of the bilateral parenchymal opacities, right more than left, is constant. No new opacities. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
