Looking at the left lung, mild pulmonary edema has improved. Greater opacification of the postoperative right lung however could be due to dependent edema if the patient is kept in the right decubitus position, or developing pneumonia, particularly from aspiration. Heart size is top-normal, small pleural effusion at the base of the postoperative right hemithorax unchanged. Air and fluid nearly fill the persistent pleural space at the apex vacated by the resected right upper lobe. ET tube, right PIC line and nasogastric tube in standard placements.
