As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The lung volumes have increased. However, the bilateral predominantly peripheral reticular opacities, right more than left, are unchanged. These might be indicative of either interstitial fluid overload, as noted in the previous report, or to a chronic interstitial process that could be excluded by a CT examination of the lung.
