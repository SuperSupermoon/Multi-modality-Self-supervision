AP portable supine view of the chest. Lung volumes are low. There is scarring in the right upper lobe likely related to old infection. Areas of presumed traction bronchiectasis in the lower lungs are seen medially which may also relate to chronic airways inflammation. A background of emphysema is suggested. The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal contour is grossly unremarkable. Old right rib deformities are re- demonstrated.
