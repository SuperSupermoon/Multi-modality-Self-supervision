Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous outside exam performed earlier the same day at 6:54 a.m. There is new right internal jugular venous catheter whose tip projects over the upper SVC. There is no visualized pneumothorax on this film noting significant rotation. Right lower lung consolidation is again seen but better characterized on previous exam suspicious for pneumonia. Left lung is grossly clear.
