AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of ___. The heart size is unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature does not appear congested. The previously identified parenchymal densities seen in the right mid lung field and more lower oriented on the left side persist. Comparison with these portable chest examinations suggest that they have increased slightly. No new discrete infiltrates are seen and no pneumothorax can be identified. The lateral pleural sinuses remain free. The chest CT examination performed during the latest examination interval disclosed a subsegmental pulmonary embolism on the right base and parenchymal densities that match sizeable atelectasis, possibly related to aspiration. The CT identified parenchymal abnormalities match those that we can identify on this supine portable chest examination. Thus, no evidence of new additional abnormalities. No pneumothorax seen in the apical area.
