A right PICC extends to the low SVC, near the cavoatrial junction. There are surgical clips in the right upper quadrant. The lung volumes remain low, with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Additionally, in comparison to multiple prior studies, there is progressive opacity involving the left hemithorax, with indistinctness of the normal vascular and interstitial markings. While it is conceivable that this represents asymmetric edema, the appearance is more concerning for an evolving infectious process. The right lung is relatively well aerated. There is no large effusion, and there is no pneumothorax. Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are difficult to assess given rotation and low lung volume, though appear stable.
