AP chest compared to ___, most recently 4:54 p.m.: Chest radiograph performed in the semi-erect position shows return of the mediastinum to its baseline appearance. If the interim widening was due to a mediastinal fluid collection, that collection has resorbed and not re-accumulated. It was due to right upper lobe collapse, lobe is re-expanded and it was due to engorged mediastinal veins and the supine position, that is no longer the case. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has changed in distribution but not in overall severity, accompanied by mild atelectasis at the bases. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or indication of pneumothorax. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. ET tube in standard placement. Right internal jugular line tip ends just above the thoracic inlet, and an enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
