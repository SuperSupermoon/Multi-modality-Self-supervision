A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, enteric tube extending below the diaphragm an off the inferior edge of the image, right internal jugular catheter terminating in the low SVC, and skin ___ and clips projecting over the mid abdomen, all unchanged. There is again a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette, bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left, and bibasilar atelectasis. A subtle parenchymal abnormality at the base of the right upper lobe could represent an infectious process.
