The patient is status post sternotomy. The aorta is calcified with mild unfolding. The heart appears normal in size. The lungs are clear. Blunting of each costophrenic sulcus is noted which makes tiny effusions possible, although the appearance may be due to scarring and does not appear changed. Right apical scarring with calcification appears similar.
