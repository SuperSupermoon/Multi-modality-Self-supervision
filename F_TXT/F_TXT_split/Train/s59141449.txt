There is new diffuse hazy opacities in lungs bilaterally and also increase in fullness of the hila bilaterally, which may represent new pulmonary vascular congestion. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. A small retrocardiac opacity appears to be slightly increased in size, may represent atelectasis or pneumonia. A left-sided ICD is in appropriate position.
