AP chest radiograph As compared to a prior study obtained on ___ at 7:23 p.m., currently there is interval improvement of pulmonary edema as well as improvement of aeration of the right mid lung, most likely consistent with resolution of hemorrhage/aspiration. Right basal consolidation is still persistent. There is no change in the appearance of the mediastinal silhouette as well as cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax is seen.
