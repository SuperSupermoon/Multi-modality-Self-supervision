Dual-lead left-sided pacer with leads intact and terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. Low lung volumes. Heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion. Some overlying motion limits evaluation of lung parenchyma. There is likely crowding of the vasculature with no overt pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. No evidence of focal pneumonia. Given the overlying motion, a small pneumothorax cannot be excluded on this study.
