Lung volumes are quite low exaggerating normal heart size and the appearance of pulmonary vasculature. I see no clear pneumonia. There is no pleural abnormality. Bilateral jugular lines end close to the superior cavoatrial junction and a nasogastric drainage tube ends in the distal portion of a nondistended stomach.
