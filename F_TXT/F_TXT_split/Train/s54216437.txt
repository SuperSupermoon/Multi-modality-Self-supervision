Right chest tube remains in place, with no visible pneumothorax. Stable postoperative widening of the right mediastinal contour with some leftward deviation of the trachea. It is uncertain whether this represents mediastinal fluid collection or hematoma following resection of a large mediastinal mass in this region. Right hemidiaphragm remains elevated in the postoperative period, and there are persistent opacities in the right middle and right lower lobes, most likely due to atelectasis. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion persists, as well as a small left pleural effusion. Left lung is grossly clear except for improving atelectasis in the retrocardiac area.
