Left perihilar consolidation which developed following pleural drainage on ___ has not cleared. This is later then usual for re-expansion pulmonary edema and raises concern for pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. Greater opacification at the base of the right lung could be atelectasis, particularly in light of increasing small to moderate right pleural effusion, but if the left side is pneumonia, the right lower lobe could be bronchogenic dissemination. Residual left pleural volume is probably moderate and the appearance of the lung base could be explained by atelectasis alone.
