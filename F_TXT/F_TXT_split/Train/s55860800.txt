There is a very large pleural effusion occupying much of the right hemithorax with mild leftward shift of mediastinal structures and inferred atelectasis of much of the right lung. A portion of the right upper lobe remains aerated, however. Patchy left basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis. There is no definite pleural effusion on the left.
