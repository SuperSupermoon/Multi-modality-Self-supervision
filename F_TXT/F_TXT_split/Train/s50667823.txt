Right chest tube remains in place, with a tiny right apical pneumothorax as well as a possible basilar component of pneumothorax. Heterogeneous opacities in the right mid and lower lung regions have minimally improved, and a loculated right pleural effusion is unchanged. On the left, there has been slight improvement in left retrocardiac atelectasis with persistent adjacent small left pleural effusion.
