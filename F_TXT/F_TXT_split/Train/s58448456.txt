Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier at 2:30 p.m. The NG tube tip currently is projecting over the left upper quadrant most likely in the proximal stomach. The right PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction/low SVC. Heart size, mediastinum and lungs appear to be unchanged since the prior study.
