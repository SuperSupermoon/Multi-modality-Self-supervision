The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. There is minimal prominence of central pulmonary vasculature which may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement. No definite focal consolidation is seen. Slight patchy opacity projecting over the right lung base may relate to overlying soft tissue and slightly prominent vascular structures. If patient able, dedicated PA and lateral views of the elbow in further evaluation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
