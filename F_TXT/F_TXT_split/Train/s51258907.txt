Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses into the lower chest, likely below the diaphragm, inferior aspect not well seen due to underpenetration. There is mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. The right hemidiaphragm appears elevated. Left base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, increased as compared to the prior study.
