Whether moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, are smaller, as it appears, depends on differences in patient posture. The apparent decrease may only be due to different distribution of pleural fluid on today's upright compared to yesterday's semi erect chest radiograph. Left basal atelectasis persists. Upper lungs are clear. There is no edema currently. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is stable. No pneumothorax. Right PIC line he ends in the low SVC.
