Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged and slightly deviated towards the right side though the patient is rotated and this limits the evaluation of the cardiomediastinum. Small left effusion is unchanged. Left lower lobe opacities are stable. Left basal pigtail catheter is in unchanged position. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is in the proximal duodenum. Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC. Cervical hardware is partially imaged. Right lower lobe opacity is unchanged, may represent a combination of effusion and atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
