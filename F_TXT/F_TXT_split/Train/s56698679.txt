Left-sided basilar chest tube is new in the interval, and the previously noted tiny left pneumothorax is not clearly visualized on this supine study. The endotracheal tube is in standard position. An orogastric tube is seen with tip coursing below the diaphragm, but off the inferior borders of the film. Widening of the superior mediastinum persists, with worsening opacities within the left paramediastinal region and right mid lung field, which may reflect atelectasis and contusions. Increased amount of pleural fluid is seen within the left hemithorax, particularly about the left lung apex. Multiple bilateral rib fractures and left scapular fracture are re-visualized.
