AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 8:05 a.m.: There is no pneumothorax, but there is progressive dense consolidation in the left lower lobe. There is some, but not substantial leftward mediastinal shift, so I am more concerned about pneumonia than atelectasis alone. The right lung is clear. ET tube, right PIC line and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements. ___, M.D. was paged at 3:20 p.m. when the findings were recognized.
