No previous images. Right subclavian catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC. Left subclavian catheter is in the upper-to-mid portion of the SVC. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with substantial prominence of the ascending aorta, raising the possibility of hypertension or aortic stenosis. There is elevated pulmonary venous pressure as well as layering effusions, more prominent on the left, with compressive atelectasis at the bases. Suggestion of some lucency projected over the lower portion of the cardiac silhouette raises the possibility of a hiatal hernia.
