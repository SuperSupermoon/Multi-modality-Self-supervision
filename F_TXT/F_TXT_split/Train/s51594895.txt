Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. No central venous line is seen. There appears to be a cath projecting over the left neck which may be within the left external jugular vein. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Low lung volumes persist. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with mild cardiomegaly. Retrocardiac opacity is seen, though no large consolidation is seen at the lung bases on CT. No large pleural effusion. There is severe degenerative change at the left shoulder joint with the left humeral head high-riding and with flattening of the adjacent acromion, not fully evaluated on this study.
