In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases. Substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. There has been the sudden development of increased opacification in the left upper zone. The configuration suggests that this represents something external to the patient. A repeat study would be recommended.
