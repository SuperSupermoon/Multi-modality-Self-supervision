Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. A dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is unchanged in position. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There are bibasilar opacities, which may be due to atelectasis, although underlying aspiration or infection is not excluded. No large pleural effusions or pneumothorax. There is gaseous distention of the partially imaged stomach.
