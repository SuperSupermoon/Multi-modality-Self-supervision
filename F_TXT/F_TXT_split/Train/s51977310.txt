There is increased opacification at the right base with silhouetting of the heart border, suggestive of middle lobe pneumonia, especially in view of the clinical history. Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
