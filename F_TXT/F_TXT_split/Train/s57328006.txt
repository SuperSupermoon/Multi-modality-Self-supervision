As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain low. In the retrocardiac lung region there is a newly appeared parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms, likely to reflect pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. No accompanying pleural effusion is noted. The left and right central venous access lines are unchanged. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
