AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 12 hours earlier during the same day. During the interval, the left-sided chest tube has been removed and no pneumothorax has developed in the apical area. In comparison with the previous study, the earlier identified patchy confluenting density in the left upper lobe lateral area persists. Also, a left-sided basal density remains obliterating partially the diaphragmatic contour and suspicious for atelectasis and/or pleural effusion. Right-sided basal densities have cleared. Previously described orthopedic overlying lower half of thoracic and upper of lumbar spine, unchanged.
