Lung volumes remain low. Linear opacity at the left base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged. Right PICC line has its tip in the right atrium. Pull-back of approximately 2-3 cm to position the tip in the distal SVC would be advised. Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
