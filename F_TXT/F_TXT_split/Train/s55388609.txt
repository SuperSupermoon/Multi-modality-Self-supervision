In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes that accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. There is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, consistent with some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. The hemidiaphragms are not sharply seen, consistent with layering pleural effusions with mild atelectatic changes at the bases. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
