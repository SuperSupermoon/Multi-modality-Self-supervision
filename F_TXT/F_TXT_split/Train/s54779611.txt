Compared with the earlier film, a right IJ line, presumably the transvenous pacing wire, has been placed. The wire loops over the right heart. The tip likely overlies the right heart, question relation to the right atrium or the right ventricle, but is not fully localize on this examination. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 6.6 cm above the carina, at the level of the mid clavicular heads. An orogastric type tube is present, looped over the expected site of the stomach and extending beyond the inferior edge of this film. An NG tube is present, tip not optimally demonstrated, but likely extending to the GE junction and very slightly beyond it. No obvious sideport is seen, but if present, the sideport is not extend beyond the GE junction. A left-sided central line is present, tip over mid SVC. No pneumothorax detected. There are low inspiratory volumes. Although the cardiomediastinal silhouette and upper zone vessels are prominent, they are likely accentuated by low lung volumes slight increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Otherwise, no focal infiltrates identified. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base. No gross effusion or pneumothorax detected.
