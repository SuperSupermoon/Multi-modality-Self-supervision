In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the position of the monitoring and support devices. No evidence of left pneumothorax with two chest tubes in place. The hazy opacification of both hemithoraces appears to be slightly more prominent. This is consistent with pleural fluid and bibasilar atelectasis. It is difficult to determine whether the apparent change reflects technical factors and patient position rather than increased amount of pleural fluid. The area of retrocardiac opacification persists, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. The current study is not oblique, so that the position of the heart is shifted towards the left could represent a true finding.
