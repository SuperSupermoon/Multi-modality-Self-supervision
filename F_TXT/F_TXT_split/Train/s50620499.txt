A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs are well expanded. Curvilinear opacities in the right lower lobe are compatible with atelectasis and scarring. There is no consolidation all effusion or pneumothorax. A right-sided PICC line tip terminates in the low SVC. Mild cardiomegaly and aortic enlargment are unchanged. The upper trachea is mildly deviated to the right.
