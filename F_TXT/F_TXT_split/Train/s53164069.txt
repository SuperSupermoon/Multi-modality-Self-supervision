Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. Aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta is again noted. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour is due to known thyroid goiter and appears unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities identified.
