Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates hyperexpanded clear lungs. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged allowing for patient positioning. There is no pneumothorax, consolidation, or pleural effusion. The endotracheal tube ends 6.5 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube enters the stomach and courses out of the field of view. A left-sided PICC line ends at the upper SVC.
