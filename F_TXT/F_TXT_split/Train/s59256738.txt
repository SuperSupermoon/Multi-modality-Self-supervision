Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 2.5 cm above the carina with the neck in a flex position. Other indwelling devices are unchanged in position. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities with relative sparing of the lung apices have slightly worsened in the interval and likely represent a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia, particularly considering the appearance on recent CT of one day earlier. Bilateral pleural effusions are not appreciably changed allowing for positional differences between the studies.
