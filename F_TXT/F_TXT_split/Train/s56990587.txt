Single erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggesting a small pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. The right lung is clear. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Minimal biapical pleural thickening is seen.
