The ETT tip projects approximately 2.5 cm the carina with the neck in neutral position. Right IJ catheter tip projects over the expected region of the upper SVC, unchanged. Left IJ catheter tip projects over the expected region of the mid SVC, also unchanged. Enteric tube traverses the diaphragm and left upper quadrant and its tip is beyond the scope of this image. Other lines are external to the patient. The patient is rotated. Lung volumes are low. Interval increase in left perihilar opacity is concerning for developing pneumonia. Interval increase in left lower lung opacity, most likely reflecting combination of increased atelectasis and size of the moderate left pleural effusion. Increased right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
