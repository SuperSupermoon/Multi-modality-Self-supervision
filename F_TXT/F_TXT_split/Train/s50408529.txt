Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior study. A repositioned nasogastric tube enters the stomach and terminates off the radiograph. Endotracheal tube ends 2-3 cm above the carina. Low lung volumes and bilateral basilar atelectasis persist. Cardiomegaly is unchanged.
