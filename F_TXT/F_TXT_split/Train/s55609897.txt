The inspiratory lung volumes are appropriate. A roughly rectangular lung lesion projecting over the third left anterior interspace is longstanding, but a 6mm round opacity over the third left anterior and smaller lesions over the right third anterior rib are new since ___. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size but stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged. Partial calcification at the aortic knob is redemonstrated. A healed lower left rib fracture is noted.
