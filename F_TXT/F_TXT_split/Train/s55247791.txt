AP chest compared to ___: Left lung shows progressive vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema. On the right, where there was a large pleural effusion on ___, there is greater opacification at the base, presumably recurring effusion, but also worsening atelectasis. Greater opacification of the right upper lung could represent asymmetric edema. Heart is mildly to moderately enlarged, and there is more mediastinal vascular congestion suggesting worsening elevation of central venous pressure or volume or both. ET tube is in standard placement, and the upper enteric drainage tube goes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
