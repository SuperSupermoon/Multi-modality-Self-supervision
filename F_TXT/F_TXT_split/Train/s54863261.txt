1. Right internal jugular Port-A-Cath and aortic endograft are unchanged. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax is seen. The amount of air within the right neck and lateral chest wall soft tissues is likely stable, if not slightly less. There continues to be bilateral fibrotic changes in the lungs that does make it slightly more challenging to detect a superimposed infectious process. No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. However, the interstitium is diffusely more prominent which suggests that there could be superimposed interstitial edema or an atypical infection. Clinical correlation is advised. No large effusions. More focal patchy peripheral opacity in the right upper lung, abutting the minor fissure is felt to reflect existing fibrotic and postinflammatory changes which are slightly accentuated on the current study due to slightly lower lung volumes rather than representing a developing infectious process. If the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging should be considered.
