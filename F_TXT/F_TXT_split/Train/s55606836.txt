Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The inferior thorax and the bilateral costophrenic angles are not included on the image. An endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.7 cm above the level of the carina. There are bilateral perihilar opacities, which could be due to pulmonary edema/ARDS; however, extensive pulmonary hemorrhage is also in the differential as well as massive aspiration. More confluent right upper to mid lung opacity is seen, which may be due to underlying consolidation due to aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, infection. Given that the costophrenic angles are not fully included on the image, it is difficult to exclude pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are not well assessed on this study.
