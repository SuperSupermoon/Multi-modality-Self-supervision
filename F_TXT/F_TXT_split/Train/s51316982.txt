No pneumothorax is identified. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There continues to be mild pulmonary edema with multifocal bilateral parenchymal ill-defined opacities, most confluent in the left lung base and left mid lung field compatible with multifocal pneumonia. Small to moderate left pleural effusion remains unchanged. Scarring with calcifications is noted in both lung apices, more so on the left. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
