In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing bilateral hazy opacification of both lungs in a patient with substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Although this could all represent pulmonary edema, in the appropriate clinical setting the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Some hazy basilar opacification suggests possible small pleural effusions. There is some displacement of the lower cervical trachea to the left, suspicious for thyroid mass on the right. Of incidental note are several rounded opacifications in the region of the stomach, most likely representing pills. Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm would be consistent with some substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
