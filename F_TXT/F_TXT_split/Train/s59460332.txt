Previously seen bilateral ground-glass opacities appear similar to prior and are consistent with patient's underlying chronic lung disease likely secondary to crack cocaine inhalation. There is no new confluent consolidation. No pneumothorax is evident. Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Moderate cardiomegaly appears unchanged.
