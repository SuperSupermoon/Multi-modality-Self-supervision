As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval placement of a left IJ central venous catheter with its tip terminating in the mid to upper SVC. ET tube now terminates 3 cm above the carina. There has been interval increase of a left moderate to large pleural effusion with improving atelectasis at the left lower lung. There is worsening of a moderate to large right pleural effusion with presumably some atelectasis. Pulmonary vasculature remains engorged. There is no pneumothorax.
