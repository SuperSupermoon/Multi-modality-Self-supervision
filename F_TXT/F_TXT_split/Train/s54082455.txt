Comparison is made with prior study ___. bilateral lung consolidations, worse on the left lung, have minimally improved on the right; these are a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia. There is probably also loss of volume in the left lower lobe. Lines and tubes are in standard position. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pneumothorax. If any, there is a small left effusion.
