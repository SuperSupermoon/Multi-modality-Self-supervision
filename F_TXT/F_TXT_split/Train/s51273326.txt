Single portable view of the chest demonstrates air under the right hemidiaphragm, likely related to recent prior surgery. The lungs are relatively low volume with bibasilar atelectasis and there is a new opacity overlying the left mid lung, likely reflecting pneumonia. Median sternotomy wires are present. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable since the prior study. No pneumothorax is identified.
