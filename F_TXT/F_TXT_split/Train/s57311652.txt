The lung volumes are normal. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Normal hilar and mediastinal structures. No pleural effusions. The lung parenchyma shows a slight increase in density at the lung bases, which, however, might be caused by dense breast tissue. A nodule projecting over the lower anterior part of the sixth left rib is likely caused by a vessel. For a definite evaluation, a frontal and lateral radiograph would be helpful.
