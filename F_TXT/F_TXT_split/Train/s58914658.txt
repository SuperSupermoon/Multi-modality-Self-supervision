Multifocal alveolar opacities in the right mid and both lower lungs have worsened in the interval and may be due to a progressive multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. There is likely a component of co-existing edema. Large lung mass in superior segment of left lower lobe is consistent with known lung cancer in this patient status post previous partial resection of the left lung for a prior diagnosis of lung cancer. Bilateral pleural effusions and left apical pleural thickening are unchanged.
