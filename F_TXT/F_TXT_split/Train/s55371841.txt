1. Right subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip in the proximal SVC. Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities most likely representing atelectasis, although pneumonia and/or aspiration could have this appearance. Heart remains enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion should also be considered. Prominent pulmonary arteries consistent with known underlying pulmonary artery hypertension, which was recently diagnosed on a chest CT dated ___. Probable layering right effusion and possible smaller left effusion. No large pneumothorax is appreciated. Crowding of the vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema.
