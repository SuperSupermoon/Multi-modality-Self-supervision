The patient is status post sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. There has probably also been coronary artery bypass graft surgery judging from the pattern of clips along the left upper cardiac border. A central venous catheter terminates in the upper atrium. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is persistent layering pleural effusion projecting over the right lower lung, which is similar to increased, probably moderate in size. Coinciding right basilar atelectasis is likely and probably unchanged. A very small pleural effusion is likely on the left. Engorged indistinct pulmonary vessels suggests mild vascular congestion.
