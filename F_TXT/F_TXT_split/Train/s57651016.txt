AP chest compared to ___ at 7:33 a.m.: Lung volumes are slightly greater, but there has been no real change in extensive consolidation in both lower lungs and small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Some of the opacification in the left lower lobe is presumably atelectasis, but much of the other opacification should be attributed to pneumonia. ET tube, transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads, right subclavian central venous catheter, are in standard placements, feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view, and a right supraclavicular catheter set ends in the right atrium. No pneumothorax.
