Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. Heart size appears mildly enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated with upper zone vascular redistribution. Lung volumes are low with streaky and patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. Vascular calcifications are noted diffusely.
