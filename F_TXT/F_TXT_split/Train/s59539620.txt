Portable semi-upright frontal radiograph of the chest. Since the next most recent study, there has been slight improvement in bibasilar opacities. Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus likely represents small pleural effusion and atalectasis. Persistent left retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis; however, pneumonia is not excluded. There is also likely a small right pleural effusion. No other focal airspace opacity is detected. The heart is not enlarged. The aorta is calcified and somewhat tortuous.
