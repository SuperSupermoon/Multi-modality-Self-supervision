AP chest compared to ___: Previous moderate left pleural effusion is smaller. No pneumothorax. Small right pleural effusion is new or appreciably larger and moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema is new. Because of rotation, I cannot tell whether there is appreciable left lower lobe atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
