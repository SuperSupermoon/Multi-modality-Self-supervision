As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Left pectoral pacemaker with an atrial and chamber lead. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable, with exception of a pre-existing slight displacement of the trachea towards the left, likely caused by a retrosternal goiter. Unchanged mild blunting of the costophrenic sinus on the left. No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Pleural calcifications along the lateral left chest wall are constant in appearance.
