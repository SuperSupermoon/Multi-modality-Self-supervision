The left lower lobe of consolidation that was seen on yesterday's chest x-ray is re-demonstrated. There is also development of new diffuse opacities that are more prominent at the lung bases, likely due to pulmonary edema. No evidence of lobar collapse. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Stable mild to moderate cardiomegaly. No acute osseous abnormality.
