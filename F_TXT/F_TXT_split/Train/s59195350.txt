Increased areas of atelectasis at the right lung basis and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, consistent with the presence of a small right pleural effusion. On the left, a retrocardiac atelectasis has also increased. The alignment of the sternal wires and the position of the right pectoral Port-A-Cath are constant.
