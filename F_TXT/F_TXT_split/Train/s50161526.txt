Endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carina. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. A left internal jugular central line is unchanged. There has been interval appearance of a diffuse airspace process in the left lung which in the setting of a recent code could reflect pulmonary hemorrhage or markedly asymmetric edema. Infection would be much less likely. Clinical correlation is recommended. There are likely small layering effusions, left greater than right. The right lung has improved aeration. Given the diffuse abnormality in the left lung, assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult in this patient status post median sternotomy. Clips in the right upper quadrant are consistent with prior cholecystectomy. No large pneumothorax is appreciated.
