Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from earlier the same day. There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest pigtail catheter projecting with tip over the right upper lung medially. There has been interval reduction in size of the right-sided pneumothorax with some lucency projecting medially at the lung base suggestive for some residual pneumothorax. There is persistent lower lobe atelectasis.There has been resolution of shift of the mediastinal structures to the left. Left lung remains clear, noting chronic changes at the base. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
