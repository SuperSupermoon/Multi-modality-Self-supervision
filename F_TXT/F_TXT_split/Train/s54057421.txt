Since the prior study, there has been interval retraction of the right internal jugular central venous catheter, which now terminates in the low SVC. The lungs are hyperinflated, with slightly improved aeration of the right lung base since the prior study. Bilateral emphysematous changes are stable. There is no over pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Nodular opacity in the right lung base is noted.
