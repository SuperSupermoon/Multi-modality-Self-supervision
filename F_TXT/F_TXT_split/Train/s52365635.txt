Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. The patient has known emphysema and a right apical mass. Scarring in the left apex is again noted. Small left pleural effusion associated with adjacent atelectasis is stable. Right medial basal opacity, likely atelectasis is unchanged. There is no evident pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Left IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Visualized bowel loops in the left upper quadrant are distended as before.
