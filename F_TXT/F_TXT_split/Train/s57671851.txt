There continues to be a layering left effusion with retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. The pulmonary vasculature still is prominent suggesting a component of mild pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax.
