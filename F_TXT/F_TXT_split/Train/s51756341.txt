No previous images. There is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary vascular congestion, raising the possibility of underlying cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. Bibasilar hazy opacifications with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms, more prominent on the right, are consistent with layering pleural effusions and volume loss in the lower lobes. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is somewhat difficult to identify in the upper abdomen. If the precise position of the tip is clinically important, and image could be obtained with the top of the cassette at the clavicular level and using abdominal technique.
