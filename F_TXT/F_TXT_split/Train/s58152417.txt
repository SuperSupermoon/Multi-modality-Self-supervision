The right PICC is unchanged with tip in the lower SVC. There is a partially visualized esophageal stent. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Underlying emphysema. There is a persistent large round opacity in the lower left hemithorax, corresponding to the loculated effusion with adjacent atelectasis seen on prior CT. Known hydropneumothorax component is better seen on the CT. Note is also made of focal high density material adjacent to left heart border, possibly representing aspirated barium, more fully characterized on the CT as well. Lungs are otherwise clear. No right pleural effusion. Small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
