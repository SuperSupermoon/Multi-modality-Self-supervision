Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There has been removal of the endotracheal tube and feeding tubes since the previous study. There remains a right IJ central line with distal lead tip in the proximal SVC. There has been mild improvement of the airspace opacities; however, there remain areas of consolidation within the left and right lung bases. There is a left retrocardiac opacity with likely pleural effusion as well. There are no pneumothoraces or signs for overt pulmonary edema.
