Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Peripheral opacities seen predominately at the base of the right lung as well as at the base of the left lung (more subtly) are consistent with pulmonary contusions as better seen on recent chest CT. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
