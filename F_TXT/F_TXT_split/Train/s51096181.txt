Chest tube overlies the base of the right lung as before. There is a small right pleural effusion and adjacent pulmonary opacity at the right base which may reflect atelectasis or infection, minimally increased from prior. Multiple rounded opacities throughout both lungs are consistent with known pulmonary nodules, better appreciated on recent CT. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The left lung is clear.
