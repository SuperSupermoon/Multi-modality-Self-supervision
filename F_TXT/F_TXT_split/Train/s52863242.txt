A right subclavian MediPort terminates in the right atrium. Allowing for differences in rotation, lungs are unchanged. Again, diffuse reticular opacities are noted throughout both lungs, left greater than right, and are consistent with known pulmonary fibrosis, likely NSIP, as demonstrated on the prior chest CT. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no focal airspace consolidation. Postbiopsy changes are seen in the right lower lung. The cardiac size is top normal and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
