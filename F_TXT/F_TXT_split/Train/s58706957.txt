Previous collapse of the left lung above the chronically elevated, paralyzed, left hemidiaphragm has improved but basal atelectasis both on the left and right has worsened since ___. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged but, at least in the right lung, I do not see edema. Heart size is large but difficult to assess because of the elevated left hemidiaphragm. Tracheostomy tube is midline, cuff chronically hyperinflated. Nasogastric drainage tube ends in the upper portion of a chronically distended stomach.
