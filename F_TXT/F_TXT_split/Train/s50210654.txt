There is a moderate right pleural effusion with opacities in the right mid and lower lung. Cavitation in the right lung mass is better appreciated on recent CT. The lung apices are relatively clear. The heart is normal in size but is shifted to the right secondary to volume loss in the right lower lung. There is no large pneumothorax.
