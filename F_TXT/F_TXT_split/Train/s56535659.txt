Heart size remains mildly enlarged. A large hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated within the air-fluid level noted. The aorta remains mildly tortuous. Widening of the superior mediastinum likely reflects a combination of an enlarged thyroid gland with tortuous right brachiocephalic vessel. Clip is noted within the left superior mediastinal compatible with prior parathyroid surgery. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Except for minimal linear atelectasis or scarring within the left lung base,the lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
