An endotracheal tube is unchanged with the tip terminating at the level of the thoracic inlet. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. Large layering pleural effusions are unchanged with opacification at the bilateral bases and retrocardiac opacification suggesting compressive bibasilar atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion/edema is unchanged. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiac silhouette remains top normal in size. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
