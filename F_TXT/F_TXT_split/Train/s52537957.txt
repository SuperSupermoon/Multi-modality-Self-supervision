There has been little change in the appearance of the chest since ___ when chest CT showed marked compromise of left lung volume by a moderate to large left pleural effusion and the very large diaphragmatic hernia transmitting a large volume of abdominal contents. Atelectasis is more severe in the right lower lung, probably by virtue of mediastinal displacement from the hernia contents. With a persistent though smaller pleural effusion. Heart size is obscured by adjacent structures. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged, and edema is mild. No pneumothorax.
