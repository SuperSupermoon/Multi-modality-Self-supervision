Right subclavian large bore catheter, left subclavian central line, and endotracheal tube are unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip not definitively identified. Layering right effusion with associated patchy airspace opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. There is improved aeration at the left base and the left pleural effusion appears to be somewhat smaller, although this could just reflect differences in positioning. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given patient rotation on the current study.
