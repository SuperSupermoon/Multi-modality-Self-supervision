Relative lucency of the upper to mid lungs suggests underlying pulmonary emphysema. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen. Patchy left base opacity is felt to more likely be due to atelectasis and possibly bronchial wall thickening rather than consolidation. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
