Study is limited by flexed neck with chin obscuring upper portions of the lungs. Within this limitation, the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes appear slightly more prominent on today's study compared to the most recent prior examination which may reflect a combination of positioning and AP lordotic view. Again noted is a markedly unfolded thoracic aorta with a right paratracheal opacity (chest CT from ___ demonstrates an aneurysmal aortic arch and proximal descending thoracic aorta). There is opacification of bilateral lung bases consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis, small on the right and moderate on the left. Underlying infection cannot be excluded.
