Compared with ___ at 18:00, and allowing for technical differences, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is CHF, with interstitial edema. Also again seen is increased retrocardiac density consistent with collapse and/or consolidation at the left base, with some addition atelectasis in the right mid and lower zone. Probable small bilateral effusions. No pneumothorax detected. The orogastric tube is similar in position, with radiopaque tip overlying the proximal stomach.
