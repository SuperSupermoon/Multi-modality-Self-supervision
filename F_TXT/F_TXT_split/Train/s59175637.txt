Supine positioning probably exaggerated severe cardiomegaly, but there is the suggestion of new mild pulmonary edema. This is most pronounced in the region of previous pneumonia in the right lung. Pleural effusion is presumed, but not substantial. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube and nasogastric drainage tube are in standard placements and a left PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
