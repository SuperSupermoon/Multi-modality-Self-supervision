As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no overall change. The pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities are artificially increased in density given the lower lung volumes of the patient. Moderate atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions persist. No larger pleural effusions. Unchanged course and position of the right PICC line.
