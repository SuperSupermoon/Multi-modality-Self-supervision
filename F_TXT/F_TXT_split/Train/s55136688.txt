As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Areas of atelectasis and bilateral parenchymal opacities, predominating in the peribronchial lung areas, of unchanged severity and almost unchanged distribution. The changes could reflect pneumonia. Slightly increasing atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung areas, potentially, a small pleural effusion on the left. Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema. Unchanged course of the right-sided PICC line.
