As compared to the previous radiograph, the malpositioned Dobbhoff catheter has been removed and repositioned. The catheter now shows a correct position in the proximal to middle parts of the stomach. There is no evidence of complication. The position of the right PICC line is unchanged, with the tip projecting over the mid SVC. No new opacities at the left lung apex as well as at the medial aspect 's of the right lung bases are constant in appearance. They are similar to an image from ___, 11:28, and thus unlikely to be related to tube malposition.
