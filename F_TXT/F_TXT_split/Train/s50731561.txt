Single AP portable view of the chest is obtained. Midline tracheostomy tube is again seen. A single-lead right-sided pacemaker is again seen with lead extending to the expected position of the right atrium. There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, which may be due to atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded. In the interval since the prior study, there has been development of scattered patchy opacities in the left lung, which raise concern for multifocal pneumonia. Correlate with history of malignancy, however, given interval development over the past 20 days, multifocal infection is most likely. There is persistent blunting and scarring at the right costophrenic angle/right lower chest. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
