Examination somewhat limited due to the patient's chin overlying the left upper lung, in the patient is somewhat rotated in position. Given this, there appears be left basilar atelectasis. Projecting over the medial right lung base, is a 1.1 x 1.1 cm structure with peripheral density and central lucency, unclear whether external to the patient versus possibly a pulmonary lesion. No pleural effusion or obvious pneumothorax is seen although the left lung apex is obscured by the patient's overlying chin. The aortic arch is calcified. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Mitral annulus calcification is noted. No pulmonary edema.
