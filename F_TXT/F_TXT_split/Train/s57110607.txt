Compared with the prior film, the left chest tube is been removed. Doubt but cannot entirely exclude a tiny residual left pneumothorax. No right-sided pneumothorax is identified. Multiple additional lies and tubes been removed. The right IJ line remains present, tip again seen overlying the mid right atrium. Again seen is increased retrocardiac opacity with partial obscuration the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. A small left effusion cannot be excluded. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the prior film, with sternotomy wires noted. At the right lung base, there is atelectasis, with probable small amount of pleural fluid and pleural thickening. Subtle deformity of the of ribs along the lower right chest wall raises the question of old healed fractures, possibly with some chronic pleural thickening.
