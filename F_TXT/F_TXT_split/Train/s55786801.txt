As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The extensive right lung changes, including enlargement of the hilar structures and the peripheral 4 cm parenchymal opacity are constant. Also constant is the presence of a mild to moderate right pleural effusion. On the left, there is unchanged evidence of a retrocardiac atelectasis but the left lung is otherwise unremarkable. Status post resection of the sixth left rib and healed fracture of the sixth left rib. Normal appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
