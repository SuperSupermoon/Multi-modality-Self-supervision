Only a small residual of previously large right pleural effusion remains, following insertion of a right basal pleural drain. An 11 mm wide well-circumscribed oval opacity projecting over the right lower lung contains air and fluid. This could be a lung abscess or alternatively a fissural pleural collection. A lateral view would be very helpful in distinguishing between the 2. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. Skin fold projecting over the left chest should not be mistaken for pneumothorax. Overall lung volumes are large suggesting emphysema. There is probably mild pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. ET Tube is in standard placement. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of a nondistended stomach.
