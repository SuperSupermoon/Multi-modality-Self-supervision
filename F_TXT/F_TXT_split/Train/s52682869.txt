As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The monitoring and support devices, including the right-sided chest tube, are in constant and correct position. The postoperative changes on the right, notably a small right pleural effusion and a mild degree of atelectasis, are without relevant change. There is a minimal improvement of the pre-existing left retrocardiac atelectasis. Otherwise the left lung and the left heart border are without abnormalities.
