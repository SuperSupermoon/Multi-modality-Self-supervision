There are bilateral pneumothoraces, which are small to moderate in size. On the left, there are multiple rib fractures, some appearing displaced, with a large amount of gas in the adjacent soft tissues extending from the base of the left neck to the left upper abdomen. Heterogeneous opacification of the left lung base is concerning for pulmonary contusion. A moderate-sized layering left pleural effusion, which on the concurrent outside hospital CT demonstrates intermediate density, likely representing blood. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Modestly calcified aortic knob is noted. The right lung is clear.
