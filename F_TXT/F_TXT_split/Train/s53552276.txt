Previous dense consolidation in all lobes improved between ___ and ___, indicating it was largely pulmonary edema, the very.one. There is some residual edema in those areas and more dense opacification in both lower lobes probably a combination of atelectasis, residual edema, and overlying pleural effusion common at least moderate on the right. Moderate cardiomegaly persists, but it too has improved over the past several days. Hyperinflation due to emphysema explains its very irregular distribution earlier. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC.
