AP chest compared to ___, 6:19 p.m. The patient is rotated, which may exaggerate leftward mediastinal shift, but the right pneumothorax is large enough to raise concern for tension physiology much less respiratory impairment. At that time, this study was reviewed, subsequent chest radiograph had been performed at 7:30 a.m. showing right apical pleural tube having treated the pneumothorax and reduced right pleural effusion. Severe cardiomegaly and left lower lobe atelectasis are essentially unchanged. The ET tube is in standard placement. Left subclavian line passes to the left brachiocephalic vein. Feeding tube passes in the stomach and out of view.
