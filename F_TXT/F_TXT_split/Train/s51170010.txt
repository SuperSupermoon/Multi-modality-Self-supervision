AP portable semi upright view of the chest. Left upper extremity PICC line again noted with unchanged position in the distal left brachiocephalic vein. Tracheostomy projects over the superior mediastinum. Area of partially calcified consolidation in the right lower lobe is grossly unchanged better assessed on prior CT. Streaky left lower lobe opacity likely represents atelectasis. Blunting of the right CP angle may indicate a small right pleural effusion. No large pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No acute bony abnormalities.
