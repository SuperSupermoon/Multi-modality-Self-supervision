There has been no appreciable change in the extent of widespread bilateral reticular opacities. Heterogeneous multifocal areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacification are minimally improved in the upper lobes, but a rounded focus of consolidation in the right mid lung has slightly worsened. These findings have been more fully characterized on CT of 1 day earlier. Diffusely distended loops of bowel in the imaged upper abdomen are unchanged, bilateral incompletely imaged on this chest radiograph exam.
