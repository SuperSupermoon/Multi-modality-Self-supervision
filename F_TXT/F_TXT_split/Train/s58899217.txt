In comparison with study of ___, the left chest tube has been removed and there is no evidence of appreciable pneumothorax. Retrocardiac and CP angle opacification persists, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. The pulmonary vessels are somewhat more prominent than on the previous study, suggesting some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed.
