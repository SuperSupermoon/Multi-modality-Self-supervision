An endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is noted looped within the stomach, with the tip coursing off the inferior borders of the film. Low lung volumes are present. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Superior mediastinal contours are widened, and there is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. Bibasilar patchy opacities are nonspecific, possibly reflective of atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
