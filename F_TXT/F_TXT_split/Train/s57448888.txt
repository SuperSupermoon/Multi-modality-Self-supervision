In comparison to the prior study from ___, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, reflective of probably mild cardiomegaly. Aortic arch calcifications are again seen. There are low lung volumes with crowding of the normal bronchovascular structures. Centrally predominant prominence of the pulmonary vasculature is suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. There is no focal lung consolidation. There is no pneumothorax, however note that the lung apices are obscured on this study. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. No sizable right pleural effusion.
