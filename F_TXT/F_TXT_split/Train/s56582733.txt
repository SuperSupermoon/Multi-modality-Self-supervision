A left sided Port-A-Cath tip projects just to the right of midline a over the expected region of the mid to upper SVC. Left lower lobe dense consolidation is perhaps slightly more conspicuous particularly in the perihilar region compared to the prior exam - this likely reflects a combination of infection in the setting of sepsis, atelectasis, as well as a small pleural effusion. New heterogeneous right lower lobe consolidation is likely pneumonia. Mild interstitial edema is improved since ___. Probable mild cardiomegaly is overall similar. No pneumothorax.
