Endotracheal tube appears in place at the mid trachea. Enteric tube traverses to the stomach. Left-sided chest tube is noted with tip at the upper portion of the left lung. Left apical pneumothorax is likely smaller and not clearly appreciated. Lung aeration appears improved. Bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis are again noted. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain stable. Post-surgical changes are partially visualized in the spine with vertical rods and horizontal screws.
