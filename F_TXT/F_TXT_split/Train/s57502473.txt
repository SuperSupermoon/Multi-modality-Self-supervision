An endotracheal tube ends approximately 3.8 cm from the carina. A right internal jugular central line ends in the distal internal jugular vein. A Swan-Ganz catheter from the femoral position ends in the proximal portion of right pulmonary artery. An aortic balloon pump sits approximately 1.6 cm from the roof of the aortic arch and could be withdrawn slightly. Sternal wires are intact. Small new bilateral pleural effusions are present. Moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged, and is more prominent on the right than the left, which is likely due to the patient's papillary muscle dysfunction. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.
