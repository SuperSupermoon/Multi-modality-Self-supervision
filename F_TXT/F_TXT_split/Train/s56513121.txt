When compared to prior, there has been interval resolution of the right hemithorax whiteout. There is some residual blunting of the right costophrenic angle and right basilar opacity. Right pigtail catheter is again seen. There may be a tiny right apical pneumothorax. Left lung remains clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch. Nodular opacity over left lung base laterally is thought to represent a nipple shadow.
