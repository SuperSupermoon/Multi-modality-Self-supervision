As compared to ___ radiograph, support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Prominent lucency along the left cardiomediastinal contour is probably due to pneumomediastinum given appearance on earlier chest x-ray of ___ and CT cervical spine of that same date. Apparent new elevation of right hemidiaphragm could potentially represent sub pulmonic positioning of a large right pleural effusion, although volume loss and right middle and lower lobes could also contribute to this process. Diffuse airspace for is opacities persist in the right lung but recently described left perihilar opacities have improved; left retrocardiac opacities have slightly worsened with persistent adjacent small effusion.
