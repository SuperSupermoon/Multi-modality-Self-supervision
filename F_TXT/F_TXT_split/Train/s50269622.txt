As compared to the previous radiograph, a nasogastric tube has been pulled back. The sidehole is now at the level of the gastroesophageal junction, the tube should be advanced by approximately 5 cm. The position of the endotracheal tube is unchanged. Also unchanged is the right subclavian access line. Moderate cardiomegaly, right perihilar atelectasis and left pleural effusion with retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged. On the right, at the lung bases, the radiolucency has increased, likely caused by improved right lower lung ventilation.
