CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. Compared with ___ at 18:52 p.m., there is slight worsening of the CHF findings, with interstitial edema and new alveolar edema in the retrocardiac region and at the right cardiophrenic angle. There is bronchial wall thickening. No gross effusion identified. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
