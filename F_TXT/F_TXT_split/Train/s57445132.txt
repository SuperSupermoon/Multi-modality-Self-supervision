As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval improvement of the apical component of the moderate right hydropneumothorax. The fluid component has however increased with persistent air fluid levels. Right chest tube remains in unchanged position. Lung volumes have decreased and there is mild atelectasis at the left lung base. The left lung is otherwise clear. Increased opacity at the right lung base remains and could be due to atelectasis and effusion. There is still ___ extensive amount of subcutaneous emphysema along the lateral chest wall and supraclavicular regions bilaterally. Again seen is evidence of prior left upper lobe resection. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
