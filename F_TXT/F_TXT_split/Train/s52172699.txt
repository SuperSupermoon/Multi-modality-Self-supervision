AP chest compared to ___ and ___: Patient has been extubated accounting in part for increased caliber of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, and severe worsening of left lower lobe atelectasis. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions have developed. Pulmonary vascular congestion persists. Air collections projecting at the level of both hemidiaphragms could be in the stomach on the left and colon on the right, but I have discussed all of these findings, with ___, and we have arranged an upright radiograph to see if there might be pneumoperitoneum.
