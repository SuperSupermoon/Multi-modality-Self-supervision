In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the appearance of the monitoring and support devices. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There is decreasing opacification at the right base, consistent with improvement in atelectatic changes. The left hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, though some atelectatic changes are again seen at the left base. No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion. Fracture of the distal right clavicle is again seen.
