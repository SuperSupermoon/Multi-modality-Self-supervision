Nasogastric tube coils over the cervical region with remaining visualized portion of the tube coursing within the thoracic esophagus and terminating below the diaphragm. It is uncertain whether the coiled portion is internal or external to the patient, and correlation with physical exam findings is suggested. Bibasilar airspace opacities are slightly improved on the right and overall worse on the left, and a small left pleural effusion persists. No other relevant changes.
