AP chest compared to ___:40 a.m.: Nasogastric tube ends in the mid stomach. Somewhat unusual anatomic relationship of the gastroesophageal junction, medial to its normal location with respect to the gastric fundus, is confirmed by comparison to coronal views of the torso CT on ___. Lung volumes are quite low, but aside from mild right basal atelectasis and crowding of engorged pulmonary vasculature, there is no significant lung abnormality. Heart is difficult to assess because of marked elevation of the hemidiaphragms, but at least mildly enlarged, though unchanged acutely. Mediastinal veins, however, are more dilated currently than previously. ET tube is in standard placement at the thoracic inlet. Pleural effusion is small if any. No pneumothorax.
