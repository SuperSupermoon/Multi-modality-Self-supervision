There is an endotracheal tube in appropriate position, terminating 3.7 cm above the level of carina. A right internal jugular central venous line terminates in the mid SVC. An enteric tube terminates in the stomach. Lung volumes are low causing crowding of the central bronchovascular structures. The heart is top-normal in size given the low lung volumes. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no pulmonary edema.
