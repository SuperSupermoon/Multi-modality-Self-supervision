In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is less obliquity of the patient. Left chest tube is in place and there is a small apical pneumothorax. Subcutaneous gas persists along the left lateral chest wall and extends into the neck. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with basilar atelectatic changes is seen. The right lung is essentially clear.
