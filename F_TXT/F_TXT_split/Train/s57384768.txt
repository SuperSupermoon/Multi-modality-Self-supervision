Left chest tube remains in place, with no definite pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Previously present left juxtahilar consolidation has substantially decreased in extent. Right perihilar opacities have also improved. There remain more diffuse poorly defined opacities bilaterally, some of which appear slightly nodular. Observed findings may be due to widespread pulmonary infection, including septic emboli in the appropriate clinical setting.
