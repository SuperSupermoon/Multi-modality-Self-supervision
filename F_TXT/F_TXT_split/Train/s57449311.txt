Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube is partially out of view, the tip appears to be at the fundus of the stomach as before. Right PICC tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC. Large right and small left pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema are stable.
