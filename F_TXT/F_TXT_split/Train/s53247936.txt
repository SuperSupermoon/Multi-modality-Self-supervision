Rotational positioning of the patient makes assessment of heart size and lung volume more difficult. However, new mild left lower lobe atelectasis is likely. Small left pleural effusion, if any, is possible. Left upper lobe and right lung are clear. There is no evidence for pleural edema or pneumothorax. The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged. ETT, enteric tube and left-sided central line appear unchanged and are in standard position. Aortic knob calcification appear unchanged.
