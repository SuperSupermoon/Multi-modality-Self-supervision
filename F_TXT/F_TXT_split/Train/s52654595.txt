AP chest compared to ___: Cuff of the ET tube is no longer hyperinflated. Tip of the tube is approximately 2 cm above the carina, and could be withdrawn 15 mm to ovoid inadvertent unilateral intubation. Widespread pulmonary edema is improving, but the lung bases, particularly the right, remain densely consolidated. There is only a small volume of pleural fluid, unchanged, and the elliptical lucency projecting over the left diaphragmatic region has been a constant feature since ___. This is a loculated collection of air whether it is in the pleural or extra-pleural space and does not warrant evacuation. Heart size and mediastinal contours are normal. Left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC, nasogastric tube coils in a non-distended stomach.
