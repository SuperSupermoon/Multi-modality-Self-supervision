Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. Again demonstrated is a rounded opacity in the left aorticopulmonary window compatible with the patient's known pseudoaneurysm, similar in size and appearance compared to prior chest radiograph, currently measuring 5.3 x 4.2 cm. The aorta remains tortuous. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Minimal linear opacities in the right lung base likely reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected. There has been surgical removal of the right proximal humerus including the head. Mild dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is noted.
