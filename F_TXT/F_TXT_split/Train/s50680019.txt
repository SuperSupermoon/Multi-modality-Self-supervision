Worsening hazy opacification involving the left mid and lower lung fields likely reflects an increasing layering pleural effusion which is at least moderate to large in size. There is continued mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Small right pleural effusion persists. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect compressive atelectasis. Ill-defined focal nodular opacities within both lung apices are relatively unchanged. New ill-defined nodular opacities within the right upper lung field may reflect superimposed infection or aspiration. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
