An endotracheal tube terminates about 3.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube in passes into the stomach although its tip is not visible, lying beyond the inferior margin of the imaged field of view. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably within normal limits, but difficult to assess given AP portable technique and low lung volumes. Patchy opacities at each medial lung base are probably due to atelectasis. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear. There is no definite pleural effusion.
