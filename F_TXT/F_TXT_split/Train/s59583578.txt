The study is slightly lordotic in positioning. There is a bandlike area of density in the right midlung zone likely representing the pleural thickening present on the earlier study seen on the lateral view. There may be a small area of atelectasis in the left lung base. There is no pneumothorax or CHF. Assuming slight differences in technique, there is no significant interval change.
