1. Endotracheal tube remains in satisfactory position with the tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. A left internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. A nasogastric tube is again seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 2. There continues to be retrocardiac consolidation which may represent lower lobe collapse with an associated layering left effusion.
