Frontal radiograph of the chest when compared to the prior study demonstrates unchanged monitoring and support devices. Heart size is enlarged and stable. Lung volumes are slightly decreased with continued perihilar opacities and mild pulmonary edema. There is a focus of new opacification at the right upper lobe which may be an artifact of patient positioning. Moderate right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
