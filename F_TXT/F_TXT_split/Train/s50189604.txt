There is again seen mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. There has been interval removal of an ET tube. Right internal jugular vein terminates in the mid-to-low SVC. Note is made of mild bibasilar atelectasis as well as mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. The lung volumes are low which explains the crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature. No overt signs of interstitial or alveolar edema is present. No evidence of a pneumothorax.
