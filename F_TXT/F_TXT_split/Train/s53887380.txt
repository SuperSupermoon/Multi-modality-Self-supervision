1. Right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the proximal to mid superior vena cava. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which has a portion coiled within the pharynx, the tip at the gastroesophageal junction and side port within the mid esophagus. Repositioning is advised. 2. The left hemidiaphragm remains elevated. The more rounded left paraspinal opacity is not as well seen on the current examination, again favoring that this most likely corresponded to a hiatal hernia, but PA and lateral imaging would still be advised once the patient is clinically stable. 3. Lungs appear well inflated and without focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. 4. Spinal fusion hardware overlies the mid cervical spine. The results of this examination were called to the patient's nurse, ___, in the ICU on ___ and 4:20 p.m.
