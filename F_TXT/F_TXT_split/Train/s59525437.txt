A single portable AP radiograph through the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating 7 cm above the level of the carina. There is no pneumothorax. An enteric tube is identified traveling along the expected location of the esophagus and terminating in the left upper quadrant in the expected location of the stomach. Bilateral diffuse patchy opacities are noted with prominent interstitial markings compatible with pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion.
