AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Mediastinum is somewhat wider after surgery, a common finding. Devices obscure the right upper hemithorax where there is at least small pleural effusion and edema in the right upper lobe presumably reflecting re-expansion after collapse during surgery. I cannot tell whether there is a pneumothorax, and the area should be re-evaluated with upright radiographs as soon as feasible. There is a right apical drain in place, tracheostomy is midline. Small left pleural effusion is probably unchanged, and previous left lower lobe atelectasis has improved. Heart size is nearly indeterminate given very low lung volumes and patient's position but comparable to the pre-operative ___. Notifications will be made depending upon the results of the subsequent chest radiograph available at the time of this review.
