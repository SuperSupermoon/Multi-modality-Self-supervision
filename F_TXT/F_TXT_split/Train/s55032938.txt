The bronchovascular markings are accentuated due to underinflation of the lungs. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is detected. There is no large pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Allowing for low lung volumes, the cardiac silhouette is likely top normal in size. The mediastinal contours are prominent due in part to low lung volumes and unfolding of the thoracic aorta. The trachea is mildly deviated to the right by the aortic knob. The visualized upper abdomen is relatively gasless with a density projecting over the left upper quadrant, which is of uncertain etiology. Deformity of several right lateral ribs likely represents old healed rib fractures.
