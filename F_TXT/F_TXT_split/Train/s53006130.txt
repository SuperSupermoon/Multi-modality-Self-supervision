There is a cardiac device generator in the right chest wall with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. There is improved aeration of the upper left lung with resolution of previously described ill-defined interstitial and patchy airspace opacities. Bibasilar opacities are grossly unchanged including abscess duration of the medial left hemidiaphragm. There is unchanged blunting of the right costophrenic angle. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, pulmonary vasculature, and aorta are within normal limits. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
