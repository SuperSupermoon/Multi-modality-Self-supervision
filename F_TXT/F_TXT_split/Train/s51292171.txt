There is an ET tube which terminates 5.8 cm above the carina. There is unchanged position of left-sided IJ central line with distal tip projecting over the low SVC. An enteric tube is again seen with distal tip not visualized below the lower limit of film. This is a sub-optimal study with significant motion artifact, which limits evaluation. There is stable enlargement of cardiac silhouette. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. The bilateral hila are not well visualized. There has been interval improvement in pulmonary edema, however mild pulmonary edema is still present. There is an obscured left hemidiaphragm and retrocardiac opacification likely secondary to small left pleural effusion and relaxation atelectasis of the adjacent left lower lobe. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
