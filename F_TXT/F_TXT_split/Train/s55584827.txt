Since the prior radiograph performed 1 hour earlier, there has been interval placement of a chest tube in the right lung base. The previously noted pneumothorax is no longer appreciated. No pneumothorax on the left. There has otherwise been no significant interval change. The upper lungs appear hyperlucent, related to severe underlying emphysema as demonstrated on the recent CT chest.
