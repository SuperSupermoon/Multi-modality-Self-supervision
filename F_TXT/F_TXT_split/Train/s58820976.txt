Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The lung volumes are markedly low, limiting evaluation for pulmonary edema. Allowing for technical limitations, there is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Osseous structures are normal. No radiopaque foreign body.
