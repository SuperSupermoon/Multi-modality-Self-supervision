Comparison is made with prior study ___. Left transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in standard position in the right atrium, right ventricle and through the coronary sinus. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Moderate large right pleural effusion has increased and increasing adjacent opacities. These opacities could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded and attention on followup is recommended. There is no pneumothorax.
