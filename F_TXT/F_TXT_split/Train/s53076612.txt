ET tube in standard placement. Rotation explains only some of the apparent rightward mediastinal shift and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, but I see no appreciable atelectasis. Lungs are grossly clear. There is no pleural effusion. Angulation of the ribs may be due to nondisplaced fractures of the right and left nineth ribs. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of chest cage trauma Any focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
