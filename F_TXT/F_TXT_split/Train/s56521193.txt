A tracheostomy tube is in appropriate position. In comparison to the most recent prior study, there is similar appearance of the opacified left lung base silhouetting the left heart border and left hemidiaphragm, compatible with chronic moderate left pleural effusion and associated left lower lobe atelectasis. Superimposed infection in the appropriate clinical context cannot be excluded. Mild streaky opacification of the right lung base is compatible with atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated, but remains moderately enlarged. The upper lung zones are relatively clear.
