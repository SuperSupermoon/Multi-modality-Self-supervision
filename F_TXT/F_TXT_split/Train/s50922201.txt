1. Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter has its tip in the left pulmonary artery. An endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Bibasilar chest tubes are unchanged in position. A left-sided pacer is again seen with the leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle respectively. The patient is status post median sternotomy with mitral valve replacement. Heart remains stably enlarged. The previously seen pneumopericardium has nearly completely resolved. There is persistent retrocardiac opacity with a probable layering effusion suggestive of compressive atelectasis. The right lung is grossly clear. No large right effusion is appreciated. There is possibly a tiny right-sided pneumothorax as there is suggestion of an air-fluid level laterally in the region of the horizontal fissure; however, this may be positional rather than representing a true finding. No left-sided pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema.
