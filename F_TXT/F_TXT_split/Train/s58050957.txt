Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears mildly enlarged. A large hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated, though there is likely mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly demonstrated. Degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint are present.
