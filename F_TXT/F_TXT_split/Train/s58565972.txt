In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 5.5 hours prior, there is increased right lower lobe atelectasis. Unchanged, dense, left lower lobe consolidation with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm is likely atelectasis with a moderate pleural effusion or alternatively a developing pneumonia. Moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged. An NG tube has been advanced and is coiled within the gastric fundus. An ET tube now terminates 4.5 cm above the carina. A right-sided IJ central venous catheter is unchanged in position and terminates in the mid SVC.
