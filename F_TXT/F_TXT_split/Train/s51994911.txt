An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A right IJ central line is present, tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. A left apical chest tube is present. There are low inspiratory volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not enlarged. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. Probable small bilateral effusions, with layering. The possibility of underlying collapse and/or consolidation at both bases cannot be excluded. Please note that a ___ at 11:51 a.m. CT scan showed a small left-sided pneumothorax, but that is not well visualized radiographically. Compared with ___, CHF findings and bibasilar findings have progressed. The degree to which some of the opacity reflects ARDS may be difficult to assess.
