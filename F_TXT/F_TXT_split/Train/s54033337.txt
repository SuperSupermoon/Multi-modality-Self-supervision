Large area of greater opacification at the base of the right hemithorax is probably worsening atelectasis in the setting of persistently elevated right hemidiaphragm. Upright radiographs, particularly with a lateral view would be helpful in distinguishing between atelectasis and pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Atelectasis at the left base is mild. Heart size is normal. ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
