AP chest compared to ___: Moderate-to-large left pneumothorax has developed from the small pneumothorax seen yesterday. Small right pneumothorax has decreased, right pleural drain in place could be fissural. Substantial right basal atelectasis has not improved. Heart size normal. This examination was available for review at 10:50 a.m. by which time left pneumothorax had been treated, so no notification was indicated.
