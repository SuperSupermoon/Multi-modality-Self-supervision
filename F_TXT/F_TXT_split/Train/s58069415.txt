Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates within the mid superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique. Widespread calcified pleural plaques are present, in keeping with prior asbestos exposure. Additional pleural thickening or small effusions may account for blunting of lateral costophrenic sulci, left greater than right. Linear areas of atelectasis or scar are present at the lung bases with otherwise grossly clear lungs. Known T8 fracture is seen to better detail on separately dictated CT from the same date.
