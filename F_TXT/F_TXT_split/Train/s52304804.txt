Comparison is made with prior study performed nine hours earlier. Left chest tube has been removed with no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. There are persistent low lung volumes. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC. Multifocal lung opacities in the lower lobes and left perihilar region are unchanged corresponding to known pulmonary contusions. There are no new lung abnormalities.
