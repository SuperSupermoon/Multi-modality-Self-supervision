Right-sided chest tube is identified with tip projecting at the right lung apex. Moderate to large right-sided pneumothorax is now seen. On prior there had been subtle lucency at the right lung base and adjacent the mediastinum raising the possibility of a small pneumothorax at that time. No obvious mediastinal shift noted on this film which is rotated and limited by patient's scoliosis. Left lung is grossly clear. No displaced fractures identified. Subcutaneous gas is seen primarily over the right chest wall.
