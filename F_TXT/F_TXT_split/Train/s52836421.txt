1. Right basilar pigtail catheter remains in place and there is near-complete resolution of layering right effusion with interval improvement in aeration at the right base where there is now only streaky linear opacities likely reflecting residual atelectasis. Left lung remains clear. No pneumothorax is seen. A small triangular opacity is noted in the right mid lung which may be vascular confluence; this can be further assessed on followup imaging. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
