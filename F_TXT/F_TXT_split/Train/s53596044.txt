1. Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing to the level of the distal esophagus, but the tip cannot be identified, but is felt to likely be below the diaphragm. There are layering bilateral effusions. The heart remains stably enlarged, most likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. There is stable mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen.
