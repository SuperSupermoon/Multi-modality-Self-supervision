Mediastinal vascular engorgement has improved. Heart is top-normal size. The lower pole of the right hilus is mildly dilated. This is a nonspecific finding, but is sometimes seen with acute pulmonary embolus. There is the suggestion of a small nodule projecting over the anterior aspect of the right third rib. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no evidence of pleural abnormality. I would strongly recommend conventional chest radiographs to help determine whether CT scanning is indicated.
