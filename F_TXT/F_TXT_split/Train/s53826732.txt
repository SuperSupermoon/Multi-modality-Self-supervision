A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right chest tube in place, which is folded over on itself. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. A subset of the known pulmonary nodules can be seen in the left upper lobe and superior to the right hilum, where chain sutures are visible after biopsy. Aside from these nodules, and linear atelectasis in the right lower lobe, the lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Pulmonary vascularity is normal and there is no edema.
