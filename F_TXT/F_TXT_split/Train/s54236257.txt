In comparison with study of ___, there is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion, raising the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. Hilar prominence consistent with lymphadenopathy is better seen on chest CT. There is suggestion of some increasing opacification at the right base, though without obliteration of the right heart border or hemidiaphragm. This could be a technical artifact, though in the appropriate clinical setting, a developing right lower lung consolidation could be considered.
