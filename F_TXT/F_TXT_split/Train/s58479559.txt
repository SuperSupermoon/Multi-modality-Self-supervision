AP single view portable chest x-ray shows Dobbhoff tube with tip ending in mid gastric cavity. Left lung base opacity has worsened since prior chest x-ray due to increased pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse. In the appropriate clinical setting pneumonia should be considered. Right lung is clear without consolidation, nodules or pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is partially obscured by left pleural effusion but appears within normal limits.
