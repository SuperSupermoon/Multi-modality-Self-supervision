A three-lead pacemaker, with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus, respectively, appears unchanged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Partly visualized is a calcified aneurysm of the left ventricle, not fully imaged, but with no indication for change. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs appear clear.
