Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ read in conjunction with chest CT on ___. Lung volumes are substantially lower today than on ___ which may account in part for some of the continued progression of severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality, but the findings suggest interstitial abnormality has increased. Whether that is all due to acceleration of fibrosing interstitial lung disease or alternatively active interstitial infection is radiographically indeterminate. Heart is normal size but slightly larger and there is mediastinal venous engorgement so a component of interstitial edema is possible. What is clear is that multifocal consolidation shown on the chest CT has progressed substantially since ___, suggesting bacterial or mycoplasma pneumonia, in addition to any possible interstitial infection. The interstitial pathogen could be virus, including influenza, or since the patient has been on steroids, pneumocystis. No appreciable pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
