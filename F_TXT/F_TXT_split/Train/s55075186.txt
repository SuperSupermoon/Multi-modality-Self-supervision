Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter continues to have its tip in the right pulmonary outflow tract. An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Left basilar chest tube and mediastinal drains remain in place. There is a small layering left effusion and possibly a smaller right effusion. Patchy opacity at both lung bases most likely reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen. Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.
