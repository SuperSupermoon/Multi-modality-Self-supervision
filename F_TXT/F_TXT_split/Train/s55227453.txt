Left internal jugular dual-channel catheter has tip ending at the origin of the SVC, unchanged since prior chest x-ray. ET tube is new with tip ending at 3 cm from the carina. NG tube has tip ending in mid gastric cavity, unchanged since prior. Three new ___ chest tubes have been placed, one in each pleural space and one in the anterior mediastinum. Patient has had stenting of the descending aorta, which appears still enlarged for hematoma, recently characterized in CT of ___.
