As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are constant, including the nasogastric tube, the endotracheal tube, the right pleural pigtail catheter and the right PICC line. The extent of the left pleural effusion with subsequent atelectasis is constant. Also constant is the moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral areas of atelectasis and signs of mild fluid overload. No pneumothorax. No larger right pleural effusion.
