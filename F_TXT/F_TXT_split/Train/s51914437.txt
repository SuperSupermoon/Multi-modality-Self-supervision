CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.1 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm overlying fundus. The sideport lies in the region of the GE junction, possibly immediately beyond it. A left IJ central line is present, tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. There is cardiomegaly, CHF with interstitial and alveolar edema, and small-to-moderate bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Compared with ___, the CHF findings and effusions are probably similar, allowing for differences in positioning.
