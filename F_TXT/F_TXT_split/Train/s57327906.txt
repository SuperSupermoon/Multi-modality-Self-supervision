In comparison with study of ___, there are slightly improved lung volumes. Retrocardiac opacification with blunting of the costophrenic angle suggests some volume loss in the left lower lobe with a small effusion. Mild atelectasis is seen at the right base. No evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. There is a slight impression on the right side of the lower cervical trachea, possibly reflecting a thyroid mass.
