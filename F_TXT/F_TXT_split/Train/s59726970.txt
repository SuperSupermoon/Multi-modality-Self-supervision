Opacity at the right lung apex is new compared with the ___ radiograph and in keeping with findings on the ___ CT scan. Allowing for differences in modalities, it may have progressed compared with the with yesterday's CT scan. There is minimal atelectasis at the left base, similar to the prior film. New linear atelectasis in the left mid-zone. Lungs are otherwise grossly clear. No CHF or effusion detected. There is a new right-sided IJ sheath in place in catheter entered follows the expected course of a Swan-Ganz catheter, with multiple radiopaque segments. This presumably represents the EKOS catheter. The tip overlies the proximal right pulmonary artery. No pneumothorax detected.
