Portable AP chest radiograph is obtained with the patient in the semi-erect position. IABP has moved up closer to the aortic arch and is now 8 mm below the roof of the aortic arch. It needs to be pulled back 3 cm to be in the desired location. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is too far into the pulmonary arterial system and likely located in the descending branch of the right pulmonary artery and needs to be pulled back 6 cm to be in the proper place. Endotracheal tube and NG tube are properly placed and unchanged. Cardiomediastinal contours and bibasal opacities are unchanged. No significant pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
