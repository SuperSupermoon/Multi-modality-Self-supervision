1. Spinal hardware overlies the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine, limiting evaluation of the mediastinal contours. A left subclavian central line and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position. The endotracheal tube position cannot be assessed given that it is obscured by the spinal hardware. Streaky opacities in both upper medial lobes are again seen and likely reflect post-inflammatory changes with associated bronchiectasis, although an acute infectious process cannot be entirely excluded given the absence of more remote comparison studies. There is now apparent obscuration of the right costophrenic sulcus, but this is felt to likely be positional rather than representing an effusion. Hilar and mediastinal contours are unchanged with the heart being mildly enlarged. Streaky opacities at the left base likely reflect atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
