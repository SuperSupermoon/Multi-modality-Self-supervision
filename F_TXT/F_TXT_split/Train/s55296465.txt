A right upper extremity PICC has been pulled back, now terminating in the upper SVC. A gastrostomy tube is partially imaged. The lung volumes are low, resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures. There is no pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. Heart size and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
