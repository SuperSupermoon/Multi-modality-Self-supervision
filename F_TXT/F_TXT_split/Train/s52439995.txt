A new right internal jugular catheter tip projects over the right atrium, but probably ends in the region of the cavoatrial junction given the low lung volumes. Endotracheal tube has been retracted, now ending 4.3 cm above the carina. Aeration of the right upper lobe has improved. Left upper lobe is obscured by an external device. Otherwise, there is no change from the prior study. No pneumothorax.
