Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Large left and moderate right pleural effusions are likely unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Cardiac size is partially obscured by the pleural abnormality. Lines and tubes are in standard position. Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side, are combination of pleural effusions and atelectases.
