Tracheostomy and right IJ central line tip overlying distal SVC again noted. No pneumothorax detected. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar, with sternotomy wires noted. Again seen is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring. There is a small left lower effusion with patchy opacity at the left lung base, possibly slightly worse. The differential could include a pneumonic infiltrate. There is minimal atelectasis at the right base, slightly more pronounced in the right cardiophrenic region, similar to the prior study. No gross right effusion. On today's exam, there is a balloon overlying the right upper quadrant, presumably representing a G-tube.
