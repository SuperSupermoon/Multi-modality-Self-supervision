Comparison is made to prior study performed six hours earlier. There is residual right-sided pacemaker wire, nasogastric tube, and left-sided central venous catheter. There is again seen a tiny right apical pneumothorax, which is stable. No definite pneumothorax on the left side is seen. There is some improved aeration of the lung bases. However, there remain bilateral pleural effusions and a left retrocardiac opacity.
