As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.5 cm above the carina. The course of the nasogastric tube and the post-surgical drains are in constant position. There is slightly increasing atelectasis and minimal pleural effusion on the left and newly occurred evidence of mild fluid overload on the right, accompanied by minimal fluid markings in the minor fissure. The overall appearance of the mediastinum and the heart are unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
