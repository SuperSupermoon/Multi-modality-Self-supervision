1. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. No central vascular catheters visualized. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Increasing perihilar fullness and indistinctness of the interstitium likely reflect mild interstitial and perihilar edema. No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. No pleural effusions. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. Left-sided nondisplaced rib fractures, better appreciated on recent CT study dated ___.
