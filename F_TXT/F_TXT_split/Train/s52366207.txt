The heart size is top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with aortic knob calcifications again demonstrated. The patient is status post right upper lobectomy with fluid noted in the right upper hemithorax, similar to that seen on the prior CT. There is no focal consolidation, new pleural effusion or pneumothorax otherwise demonstrated. Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Minimal patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis.
