As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. There is no substantial change in appearance of the monitoring and support devices. Massive asymmetry of the ribcage 2 to severe scoliosis remains present, with subsequent limitations of the evaluations of the lung bases. The presence of a minimal left and right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Unchanged mild retrocardiac atelectasis. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without overt pulmonary edema.
