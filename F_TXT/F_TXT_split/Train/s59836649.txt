Right-sided PICC line ends in the mid SVC. The enteric catheter traverses past the diaphragm; however, coiling is noted within the throat region. Consolidation in the left lobe is seen and is described in further detail in other imaging reports. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is noted. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are unchanged from previous radiographs. No definite bony abnormalities are noted.
