The patient has had endobronchial lung reduction for COPD with positioning of multiple bilateral coils, which have stable appearance. Lung volume is reduced with interval increase of bibasilar opacity suspicious for developing pneumonia, probably for aspiration. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Enlarged central pulmonary arteries are suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
