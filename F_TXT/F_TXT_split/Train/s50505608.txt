AP chest radiograph As compared to most recent prior radiograph obtained at 7:03 p.m., there is no substantial change in multifocal consolidations. As previously mentioned, the course of the right internal jugular line is unusual and it should be confirmed by venous sampling output. No interval development of pneumothorax or new consolidations have been demonstrated. The NG tube is in the stomach with the stomach being less distended.
