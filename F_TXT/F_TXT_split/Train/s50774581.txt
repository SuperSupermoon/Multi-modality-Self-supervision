Lung volumes remain low with patchy bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Small associated left pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascular crowding due to low lung volumes with no overt pulmonary edema. No obvious pneumothorax, although the patient's mandible obscures part of the apices. Interval removal of the right internal jugular central line.
