Lordotic positioning. Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. Compared to the prior study, I doubt significant interval change. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. Mild prominence of right paratracheal soft tissues is similar to prior,, though likely accentuated by lordotic positioning. Aorta is minimally unfolded. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Bibasilar atelectasis is slightly improved. No new focal opacity. No gross effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
