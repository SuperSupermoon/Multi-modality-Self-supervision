1. There continues to be a right apical lateral and likely basilar pneumothorax with a right pleural catheter remaining in place. Overall, there is increasing opacification at the right mid and lower thorax. If trapped lung remains of clinical concern, further imaging evaluation with CT would be helpful. There is persistent opacity at the left base, particularly retrocardiac, which could reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion. There is increased fullness of the perihilar vasculature and indistinctness of the interstitium, which suggest a superimposed component of pulmonary edema at the present time. Left pleural calcifications are again seen. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable, although difficult to assess due to the airspace process.
