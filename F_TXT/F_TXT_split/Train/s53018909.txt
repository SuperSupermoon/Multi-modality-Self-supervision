The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. Small calcified nodules at the left apex suggest small granulomas. Apical pleural scarring is also partly calcified, but otherwise there is no evidence for pleural calcification. The lungs appear otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
