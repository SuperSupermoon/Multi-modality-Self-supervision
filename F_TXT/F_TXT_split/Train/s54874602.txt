Cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion, perihilar haziness, and asymmetrically distributed consolidation, predominantly in the right upper lobe and right infrahilar region. Observed findings could be due to clinically suspected pulmonary edema with asymmetrical distribution, but superimposed aspiration or infectious pneumonia in the right lung is also possible, and short-term followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
