Two frontal images of the chest demonstrated Dobbhoff tube with the tip in the stomach. The tube is not post-pyloric. There is no pneumothorax or other complications visualized. There is moderate pleural effusion on the right, unchanged since previous imaging. There is a small left pleural effusion also unchanged since previous imaging. A consolidation is again seen in the right lower lobe medially which is due to radiation changes. There is an enlarged cardiac silhouette secondary to a known pericardial effusion.
