The patient is now intubated with the endotracheal tube in good position. Very low lung volume with patchy areas of subsegmental atelectasis and crowding of the bronchovascular markings. No acute focal consolidation, pneumothorax or significant effusion. Given for differences in technique, the cardiomediastinal contours are stable, with widening of the superior mediastinum.
