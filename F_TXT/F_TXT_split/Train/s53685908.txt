Single AP view of the chest was reviewed. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Lung volumes remain low. Atelectasis is again seen at the left lung base. Focal opacity in the right mid lung zone is in the area of previously noted atelectasis. Chronic deformity of the right distal clavicle is post-traumatic.
