Assessment is slightly limited by patient positioning. Cardiac silhouette size appears borderline enlarged. Aortic knob is calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Partially imaged is an inferior vena cava filter in the midline upper abdomen as well as multiple clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
