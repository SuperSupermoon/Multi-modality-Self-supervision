In comparison with study of ___, the right PICC line has been removed and replaced with a left PICC line that extends to the lower portion of the SVC. The patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration. There are areas of increased opacification at the bases, most likely reflecting atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. There is suggestion of some increased widening in the right paratracheal region. This area should be checked on the subsequent radiographs. Left chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
