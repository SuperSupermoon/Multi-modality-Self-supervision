Nasogastric tube has been exchanged for a feeding tube, which terminates in the stomach. Right upper lobe consolidation appears slightly more dense centrally, with an evolving area of adjacent radiolucency corresponding to an area of necrotizing pneumonia on prior CT of ___. Diffuse ground-glass and reticular opacities are present throughout the left lung, and have waxed and waned on serial chest radiographs. This favors asymmetrical edema over left lung pneumonia. A small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has increased in size. Lucencies at left lung apex correspond to known bullous emphysema on prior CT.
