In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. The haziness of the left hemithorax has somewhat decreased, though this most likely reflects a more erect position of the patient rather than substantial clearing of the pleural effusion. Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. There is again evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Little change in the patchy opacifications within the right upper, right lower, and left perihilar regions.
