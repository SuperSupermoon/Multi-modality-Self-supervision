Lung volumes are diminished, compared to the baseline of a hyper inflated chest. Some of the explanation is any increase in moderate bilateral pleural effusions. There is also sufficient opacification at both lung bases to raise question of pneumonia. The upper lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette larger today than on previous AP studies suggesting new cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. Right internal jugular dual channel catheter ends low in the SVC. No pneumothorax.
