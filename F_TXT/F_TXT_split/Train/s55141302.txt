AP view of the chest provided. Compared to prior study from 2 days ago, there is little change. Again seen is significant elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, likely secondary to phrenic nerve injury and pleural effusion, unchanged in extent. Large right hilar and mediastinal mass is again seen. Left lung is essentially clear. Mild cardiomegaly appears chronic.
