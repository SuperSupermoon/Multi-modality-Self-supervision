As compared to the previous radiograph, there are bilateral newly appeared extensive parenchymal opacities, notably in the perihilar areas and at the lung bases. The opacities are slightly more severe on the left than on the right. There is unchanged evidence of cardiomegaly. Signs of interstitial fluid overload are absent. In particular, there is no interstitial thickening and no pleural effusions. Overall, the distribution and morphology of the changes are more likely reflecting pneumonia than pulmonary edema.
