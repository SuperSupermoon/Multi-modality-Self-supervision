Left PICC terminates in upper SVC. A transesophageal tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view. Lung volume remains low. Bilateral pleural effusions are small to moderate which appear more conspicuous than before, likely from difference in pleural fluid layering. Old healed right rib fractures are again noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal size.
