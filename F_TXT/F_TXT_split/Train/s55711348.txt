AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Patient is status post upper lobe wedge resection. There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. A left-sided chest tube has been placed, seen to terminate in the left apical area. Linear densities reaching from the hilum up to the axillary region are indicative of the recent chest intervention. No significant pneumothorax is identified in the apical area. No mediastinal shift. The right hemithorax demonstrates normal pulmonary vasculature without evidence of congestion.
