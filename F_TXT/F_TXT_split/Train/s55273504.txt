Lung volumes are slightly decreased. The heart continues to be enlarged with associated mild-moderate pulmonary edema. A left subclavian Port-A-Cath is in stable position with its tip terminating in the proximal right atrium. No definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. Although probably merely a prominent right upper lobe vessel there is some nodularity in the right suprahilar region. Followup is recommended
