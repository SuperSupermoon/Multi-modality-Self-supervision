Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. A bilateral asymmetrically distributed airspace process has slightly worsened in the interval, with more confluent opacification noted in the right upper lobe and left juxtahilar region. These findings could be due to multifocal infection, asymmetrical edema or clinically suspected ARDS. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
