As compared to the previous radiograph, the free air in the abdomen of the colectomy has slightly increased. This causes continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and subsequent atelectasis at the right lung bases. Retrocardiac atelectasis is also present. Mild cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema. No pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
