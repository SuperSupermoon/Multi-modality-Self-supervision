Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip 4 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. Interval removal of the right basilar pleural pigtail catheter. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-supine technique. There is a residual stable basilar loculated pleural effusion and persistent airspace opacity at the right base which may reflect atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Although lung volumes remain low, the left lung is grossly clear. There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema is evident.
