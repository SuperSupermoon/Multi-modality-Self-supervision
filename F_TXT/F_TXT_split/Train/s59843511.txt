The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, within the mid trachea. Enteric tube courses along the esophagus and terminates at the view, likely within the stomach. A left PICC has been removed in the interim. There has been improved aeration of the left lung base, with the left apparent hemidiaphragm being more conspicuous on this exam. Multiple lucenies are also noted in this area. A right hilar opacity is likely infectious in etiology. There is no definite pleural effusion. The right lung is clear and there is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
