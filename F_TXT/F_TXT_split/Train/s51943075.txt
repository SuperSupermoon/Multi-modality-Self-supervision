Lung volumes are low. Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Aortic CoreValve device is again noted. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged, but there is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis. Known pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT are not well assessed on the current radiograph.
