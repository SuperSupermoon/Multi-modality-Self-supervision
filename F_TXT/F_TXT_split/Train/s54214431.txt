Semi supine chest radiograph was obtained. Given supine technique assessment of pneumothorax is limited without evidence of large pneumothorax. Small apical pneumothorax is likely still present. Lungs are low in volume with resultant bronchovascular crowding and linear basilar atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
