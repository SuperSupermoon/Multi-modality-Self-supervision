A single upright chest radiograph was obtained. The Pleurx catheter is in stable position in the right basilar pleural space. There is minimal, if any, residual pleural effusion. A moderate right basilar atelectasis is unchanged. Left effusion and pleural calcifications changes are stable. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. A massive hiatal hernia is again seen.
