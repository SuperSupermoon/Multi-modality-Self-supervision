Compared to the prior study, there is slightly more pronounced upper zone redistribution. In addition, there is new hazy opacity at the right lung base. This likely represents an element of atelectasis. The possibility of an element pleural fluid cannot be excluded. The right hemidiaphragm is partially obscured. Aside from some subsegmental atelectasis, the left base and remainder of the left lung remains grossly clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Background osteopenia and degenerative changes of the spine are noted. There is left-sided wedging of a lower thoracic vertebral body, question T11 or T10, which is similar the T-spine CT from ___ (at which time it was designated T10).
