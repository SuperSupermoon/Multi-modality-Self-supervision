A right-sided dual-lumen pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is relatively unchanged. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. Lung volumes are decreased from the prior study, which causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Small right pleural effusion has developed from the prior study, and there is mild patchy opacity in the right lung base which may represent area of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present.
