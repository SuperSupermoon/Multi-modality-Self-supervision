There is interval development of mild vascular congestion although no overt pulmonary edema is seen. Cardiomegaly is substantial, unchanged. Left basal opacity is slightly more opacified in a symmetric fashion that might represent either atelectasis or developing infection. Aspiration is a possibility. Reassessment of this area is recommended on the subsequent study.
