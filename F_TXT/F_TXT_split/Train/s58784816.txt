Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated slightly to the left. A midline tracheostomy tube is seen. There are low lung volumes. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle could be due to overlying soft tissue, though a small pleural effusion is not excluded. There also appears to be trace fluid tracking along the right minor fissure. Left base patchy retrocardiac opacity could relate to atelectasis or aspiration, although underlying infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is top normal.
