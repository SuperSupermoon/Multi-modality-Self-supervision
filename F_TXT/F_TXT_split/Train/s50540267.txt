The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is mild cardiomegaly which may be accentuated by technique. A moderate right pleural effusion with layering pleural fluid is noted. Opacification in lung base with air bronchograms probably indicates pneumonia in the correct clinical setting. Small area of consolidation also seen at the left upper lung may also represent pneumonia.
