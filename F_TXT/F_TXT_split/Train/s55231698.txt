As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The degree of advanced opacification in the left hemithorax is constant. The co-existing left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Overall, the mediastinum appears slightly widened, as noted on the previous examination. No pneumothorax. No new parenchymal opacities. As previously noted, CT might be indicated to clarify the nature of the findings.
