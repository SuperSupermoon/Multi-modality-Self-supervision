As compared to the previous radiograph, a nasogastric tube was placed. The tip of the tube projects over the gastroesophageal junction, the sidehole is still in the lower esophagus. The tube should be advanced by approximately 5-10 cm. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. However, the pre-existing atelectasis at the right has substantially increased in severity. The right internal jugular vein catheter is unchanged.
