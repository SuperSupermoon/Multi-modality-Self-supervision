Single frontal view of the chest. Right apical pneumothorax is tiny and right pleural tubes are in stable position. Slight interval increase of right base opacity is likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion. Multiple bilateral nodular metastases are similar to prior. Lung volumes are low, exaggerating heart size. Mediastinal contours are stable.
