The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the study, which is severely underpenetrated. A transesophageal catheter is present, extending to at least the level of the GE junction, however, the distal portion is difficult to assess due to underpenetration and overlying soft tissues. The lungs are underinflated. There is central pulmonary vascular congestion with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, with superimposed left basilar and right upper zone atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen.
