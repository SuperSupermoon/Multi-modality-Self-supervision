AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The heart size is mildly enlarged, but unchanged in comparison with previous study. There is a pulmonary congestive pattern with typical upper zone redistribution and perivascular haze throughout. This congestive pattern; however, has improved mildly in comparison with the previous study. No evidence of new acute discrete parenchymal infiltrates and the lateral pleural sinuses are free. A previously existing right-sided PICC line is again identified and seen to terminate in unchanged position, some 3 cm below the level of the carina. This indicates the lower third of the SVC. No pneumothorax or any other possible placement-related complication.
