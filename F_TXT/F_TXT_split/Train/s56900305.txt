1. The right subclavian PICC line is at the level of the proximal SVC, but the tip is obscured by the overlying spinal hardware projecting over the upper and mid thoracic vertebrae. There has been interval removal of the left chest tube with no evidence of a pneumothorax. Persistent opacification at the left base likely reflects a combination of partial lower lobe atelectasis and pleural fluid. The right lung remains well inflated and clear. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Heart is stably enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged given differences in patient rotation.
