AP chest compared to ___: Severe diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality is still present. Lower lung volumes compared to 12:42 p.m. on ___ could be partially responsible for exaggeration of the severity of the abnormality, moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal widening due to at least some vascular engorgement. A change in distribution of the lung abnormality, now worse at the bases suggests a large component of hydrostatic edema and therefore cardiac decompensation is the simplest explanation. However, there is persistence of the right suprahilar consolidation with a suggestion of central cavitation, so concurrent pneumonia needs to be considered. Leukemic infiltrates due to the effects of leukostasis are reported with myelocytic leukemia and leukocytosis >100,000, primarily composed of granulocyte blast cells. I am told the count in this patient exceeds 200,000 but the cells more mature than blast cells. Since radiographically detectable leukostasis has been reported in acute lymphocytic leukemia with white counts >>100,000, it is conceivable that is the case here, but the diagnosis cannot be presumed.
