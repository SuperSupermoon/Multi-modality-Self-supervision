A small residual loculated air collection may be present at the left base at the site of chest tube removal. A more vertically oriented lucent line at the left base is more likely to represent a skinfold rather than a large pneumothorax. Consolidation and small effusion at the right base are unchanged. A right internal jugular catheter remains at the cavoatrial junction. An endotracheal tube remains in the upper airway. Nasogastric tube remains in the stomach. Thoracic spinal fusion and spacer hardware is stable.
