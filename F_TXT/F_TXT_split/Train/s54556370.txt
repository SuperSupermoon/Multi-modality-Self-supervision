AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Tubular partially solid opacity in the right lower lung is not well characterized by this conventional chest radiograph. It should be reevaluated with conventional chest films when feasible, and a CT scan if it persists. It looks like mucoid impaction in area of possible bronchiectasis. On the left is a band of plate-like atelectasis. The upper lungs are clear. No good evidence for pneumonia or heart failure. Heart is top normal size. Thoracic aorta is tortuous but not clearly dilated. There is no pleural abnormality.
