Hilar and cardiac contours are unremarkable; however, there is a right upper mediastinal contour abnormality with partial obscuration of the right paratracheal stripe. There is also questionable medial displacement of the aortic calcifications at the level of the knob and descending aorta. Findings may represent aortic dissection in proper clinical setting. Atelectasis noted in the left lower lung with likely partial collapse of the medial aspect of the left lower lobe. No osseous abnormality evident.
