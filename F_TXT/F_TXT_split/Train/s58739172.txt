The patient has had prior median sternotomy. A enteric tube coils within the stomach. A right-sided PICC line ends in the mid SVC. Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions is unchanged. Retrocardiac opacification is stable, and likely due to a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion. Unchanged nodular opacities in the left upper to mid lung may be due to infection, however a chest CT is recommended for more definitive assessment. There is no pneumothorax.
