A portable upright chest radiograph shows dense obscuration of the left diaphragm, which has been present since prior films over the past month and does not appear to have progressed. Some of this opacity may be related to left pleural fluid as evidenced by some blunting of the costophrenic angle. There is increasing obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm and while radiographically the changes could be related to a combination of atelectasis and fluid, new pneumonia cannot be excluded. Tracheostomy tube and nasogastric tube are in unchanged position in this patient with scoliosis.
