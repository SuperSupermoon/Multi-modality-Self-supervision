The right subclavian PICC line remains with its tip in the mid portion of the SVC. Cardiac silhouette is somewhat more prominent than on the previous study. It is unclear whether this merely represents a change in systole versus diastole, or whether the possibility of a collection of pericardial fluid should be considered. The large hiatal hernia is again seen. No definite acute focal pneumonia.
