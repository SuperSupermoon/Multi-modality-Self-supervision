The study is suboptimal due to patient's positioning and exclusion of the portion of the right lateral chest. Since the prior study, there is mild enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions, large on the right and moderate on the left with compressive atelectasis of the lung bases. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable, but less well evaluated on the current study. Two disrupted upper sternotomy wires are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is present.
