Again seen is the right IJ single pacing lead with tip over right ventricle. Inspiratory volumes are considerably lower. Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. A small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. The vascular markings are prominent, more so than on the previous film, but likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Minimal atelectasis at the right base. Heart borders are obscured by left base opacity, but grossly unchanged.
