In comparison with the most recent radiograph obtained one hour prior, there is no significant interval change in widespread diffuse parenchymal opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema. More focal areas of opacification are present including at the left base as well as to a lesser extent at the right base such that infection cannot be entirely excluded. There is likely significant atelectasis at the left base. A left pleural effusion may also be present. Endotracheal tube is in standard position. An esophageal catheter courses inferior to the diaphragm with tip in the stomach and side port near the gastroesophageal junction. Gaseous distention of several bowel loops is partially imaged. The heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged.
