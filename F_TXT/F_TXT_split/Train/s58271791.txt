AP chest radiograph Additional interval improvement in the appearance of the left lung with substantial improvement of the left lung aeration is noted on the current study. Lobular appearance of the left infrahilar area is consistent with known mass. The left mid lung nodule is currently better visible due to improved lung aeration as well as multiple additional pulmonary nodules scattered throughout the lungs. Right basal opacity as well as bilateral pleural effusions have substantially improved.
