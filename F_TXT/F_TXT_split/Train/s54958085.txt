No previous images. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 6 cm above the carina. Dobbhoff tube extends to the body of the stomach. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits and normal or mildly enlarged. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. Poor definition of the left costophrenic angle could reflect a small effusion, though it may only be a manifestation of overlying soft tissues. No acute focal pneumonia. In the right upper zone, there is suggestion of a nodular opacification adjacent to the inferior aspect of the fourth posterior rib. This could well represent merely a combination of shadows, but should be evaluated on subsequent images.
