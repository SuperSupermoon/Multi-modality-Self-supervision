In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again substantial opacification in the left mid and lower lung consistent with a combination of pleural effusion and consolidation on the prior CT study. The right lung is essentially clear and there is little if any vascular congestion. Mild streak of atelectasis is seen at the right base.
