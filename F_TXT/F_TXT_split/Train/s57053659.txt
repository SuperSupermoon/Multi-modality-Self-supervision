Relative increased density of the left lung base is unchanged compared to multiple prior examinations and likely reflects chronic pleural thickening. Lungs are otherwise clear without confluent consolidation. There is no pulmonary edema or large pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Moderate cardiomegaly appears unchanged.
