In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been some improvement in the prominence of indistinct interstitial markings consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Nevertheless, there is some continued evidence of vascular engorgement. Left basilar opacification is unchanged, consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. More focal area of opacification in the right upper zone could reflect an infectious process.
