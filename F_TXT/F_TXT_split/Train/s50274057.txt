There are surgical clips and volume loss in the right lower hemithorax with flattening and a meniscoid appearance to the pleural surfaces suggesting smooth scarring, pleural effusion, or both. Similar findings are present at the left lung base, but to some extent less striking, suggesting a small pleural effusion with minor atelectasis. Mild subpleural scarring is noted at the right lung apex.
