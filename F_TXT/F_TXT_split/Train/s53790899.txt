Overlying trauma board slightly limits assessment. The lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is mildly enlarged. There is no mediastinal widening. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is likely related to low lung volumes. Mild atelectasis is noted within the lung bases. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No displaced fractures are seen.
