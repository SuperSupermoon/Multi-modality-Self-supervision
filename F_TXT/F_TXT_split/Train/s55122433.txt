A right Port-A-Cath is new and its tip projects over the expected region of the distal SVC. The NG tube has been removed in the interim. Detailed evaluation of the right apex is limited secondary to overlying soft tissue from the patient's chin being flexed. Bilateral parenchymal airspace opacities involving most of the right lower and mid hemithorax as well as the left lower hemi thorax are new and more extensive on the right. The upper lungs are relatively spared. There is a layering right pleural effusion. No left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size. No pulmonary vascular engorgement.
