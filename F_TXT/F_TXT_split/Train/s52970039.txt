AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Status post sternotomy, ___ mitral valve prosthesis in place, permanent left-sided pacer with dual intracavitary electrode system, all unchanged. On the right side, the evidence of pleural effusion has again decreased slightly in comparison with the next preceding study of ___ at which time a mild increase of pleural effusion was noted in comparison with an image obtained two days earlier. These variations illustrate difficulties to quantitate pleural effusions on single portable chest views. On the left side, the evidence of pleural effusion is more impressive as it obliterates totally the entire left-sided diaphragm and the density reaches up to the hilar area and beyond. Also noted is an increased amount of pleural density along the mediastinal structures reaching into the left-sided apical area. No pneumothorax is identified.
