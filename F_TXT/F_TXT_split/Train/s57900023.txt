The heart appears stably enlarged given differences in positioning and technique between studies. Overall mediastinal contours are stable. There is worsening interstitial and airspace disease with more consolidative appearance in the bases. These findings most likely reflect worsening pulmonary edema, although a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. There are likely bilateral layering effusions. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Bilateral scapular fractures are again seen. The known rib fractures are not as well appreciated on the current examination.
