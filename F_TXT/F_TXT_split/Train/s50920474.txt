Interval removal of right-sided chest tube, with no visible pneumothorax on this apparently semi-upright projection. Small-to-moderate layering right pleural effusion is new. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for differences in lung volumes. Distention of azygos vein may reflect increased volume status of the patient, but there is no overt evidence of pulmonary edema. New left retrocardiac opacity probably reflects atelectasis and is accompanied by small left pleural effusion.
