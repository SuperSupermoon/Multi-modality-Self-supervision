In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion. This again suggests cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with some combination of left effusion and substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. The right lung remains essentially clear except for relatively mild atelectatic changes.
