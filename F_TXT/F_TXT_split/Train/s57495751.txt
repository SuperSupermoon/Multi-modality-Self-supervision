AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained two hours earlier during the same day. The previously questioned minimal right-sided pneumothorax cannot be identified anymore. Lungs appear clear from infiltrates. The right-sided chest tube has now been removed and there remains a local chest wall emphysema similar as it existed before. No new pulmonary abnormalities identified.
