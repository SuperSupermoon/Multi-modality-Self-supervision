Interval removal of support and monitoring devices with residual right PICC in place. Small left apical pneumothorax has developed following left chest tube removal. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in the post-operative period. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by interstitial edema. A new focal airspace opacity has developed in the right upper lobe and could reflect asymmetrical edema, aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia. Followup radiographs would be helpful. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also noted.
