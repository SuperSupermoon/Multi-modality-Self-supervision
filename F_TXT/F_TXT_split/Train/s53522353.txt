The right apical pneumothorax has increased slightly and redistributed to the right apex, now moderate without associated mediastinal shift. A right chest tube with minimal associated subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged. The right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium. An ascending aortic stent projects in unchanged location. A Dobhoff tube has been advanced, now terminating within the stomach. Diffusely increased interstitial markings compatible with moderate pulmonary edema superimposed on known moderate to severe emphysema is unchanged from the immediate prior study.
