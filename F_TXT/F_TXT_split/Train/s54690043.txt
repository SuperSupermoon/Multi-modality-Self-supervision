Endotracheal tube, right subclavian PICC line, and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pulmonary edema. Right lung is grossly clear. Retrocardiac consolidation persists with adjacent layering left effusion. Findings would be consistent with partial lower lobe compressive atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi erect technique.
