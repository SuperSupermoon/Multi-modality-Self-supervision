As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular vein catheter was removed and replaced by a hemodialysis catheter. The patient has also received a new feeding tube. This feeding tube is coiled in the stomach, the tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach. The lung volumes continue to be low and the size of the cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia, are not substantially changed. No larger pleural effusions. No visible free intra-abdominal air.
