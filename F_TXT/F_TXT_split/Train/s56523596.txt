No previous images. Nasogastric tube extends to the mid body of the stomach before coiling back on itself so that the tip lies just below the hemidiaphragm. There are low lung volumes.

The possibility of supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. The left lung is essentially clear.
