As compared to the previous radiograph, the course and position of the Dobbhoff catheter are normal. There is no coiling of the catheter. The lung volumes have slightly decreased. Therefore, the pre-existing opacities on the right and on the left, notably at the lung bases, appear slightly more extensive than on the previous image. No pneumothorax. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without overt pulmonary edema.
