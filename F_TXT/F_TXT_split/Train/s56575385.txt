The AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates progression of extensive right lung consolidations, in particular involving right upper lobes with most likely present lymphadenopathy in the right hilus. There is also interval progression of interstitial pulmonary edema superimposed on the infection. Small bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
