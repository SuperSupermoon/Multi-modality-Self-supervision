Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of a dual-lead left-sided pacer device with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. The cardiac silhouette is moderate to severely enlarged. There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and bibasilar opacities. Left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. No pneumothorax is seen.
