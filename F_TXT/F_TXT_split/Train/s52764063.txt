AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. A right-sided PICC line is identified and seen to terminate overlying the lower third of the SVC. No pneumothorax has developed. The lateral pleural sinuses are free. Previously described scattered multifocal parenchymal infiltrates are still seen. They are similar to what has been shown on recent chest CT (___), but cannot be evaluated in same detail.
