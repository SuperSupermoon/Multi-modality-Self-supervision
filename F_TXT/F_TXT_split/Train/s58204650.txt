With the chin elevated, tip of the ET tube only 2 cm above the carina is probably lower than advisable and it should be withdrawn 15 mm. Right internal jugular line ends at the superior cavoatrial junction. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach but should be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Mild interstitial edema is present at both lung bases, and I suspect there are small pleural effusions as well, but without change since 7:30 p.m. Heart size is normal. Upright view should be repeated to confirm that we are seeing a thick skin fold crossing the apex of the left chest and not a pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged at 10:20 a.m.
