Single portable AP view of the chest was provided. Multiple overlying wires are present. The lungs appear essentially clear though right CP angle is excluded. A lucency below the right hemidiaphragm could represent air within loops of bowel though free air cannot be excluded. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable given patient rotation and/or technique. Bony structures are intact. Partially imaged hardware in the lumbar spine noted.
