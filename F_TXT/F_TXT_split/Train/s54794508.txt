Patient rotation slightly limits assessment. A large right pleural effusion has increased in size compared to the most recent prior exam. There is associated right basilar atelectasis. The heart size is not enlarged. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is likely present. Minimal streaky opacity in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis. An abdominal drain is seen which terminates in the right upper quadrant, where there is relative lucency, new from the prior exam.
