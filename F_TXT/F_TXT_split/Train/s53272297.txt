AP chest compared to ___: Extensive bilateral consolidation has improved, particularly in the right upper lobe, still moderate to severe in the lower lungs, right greater than left. Overall, lung volumes have decreased, probably by virtue of increasing small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured, and heart size is indeterminate. Mediastinal contour suggests persistent mediastinal venous engorgement. ET tube and left internal jugular line, and upper enteric drainage tube are all in standard placements. No pneumothorax.
