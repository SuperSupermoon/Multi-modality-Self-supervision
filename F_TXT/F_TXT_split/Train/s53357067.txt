AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained nine hours earlier during the same day. There is less amount of pleural effusion on the left side indicating successful performance of thoracocentesis. Still some blunting of the lowermost lateral pleural sinus remains. Right-sided pleural effusion appears unchanged.
