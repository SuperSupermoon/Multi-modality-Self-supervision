AP chest compared to ___: The patient has had median sternotomy, heart is mildly enlarged, mediastinal veins are substantially distended and pulmonary circulation is only mildly congested. I see no appreciable pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. Left infrahilar opacification is most commonly due to atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
