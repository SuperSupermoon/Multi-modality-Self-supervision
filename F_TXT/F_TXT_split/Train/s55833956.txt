New tracheostomy is in place. A left-sided PICC tip seats at the cavoatrial junction. The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are also within normal limits. Ill-defined opacity and blurring of the left hemidiaphragm are most compatible with small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. A gastrotomy tube projects over the left upper abdomen.
