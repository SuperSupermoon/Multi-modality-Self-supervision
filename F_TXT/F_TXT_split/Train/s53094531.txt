When accounting for redistribution and patient positioning, no significant interval change. Bilateral extensive patchy opacities in the setting of essentially normal heart size suggests ARDS. However, some nodularity to the opacities could be infection. No change in position of support devices including ETT (tip 7 cm from carina), right internal jugular venous catheter (tip in the mid SVC), and enteric tube (in stomach). No pneumothorax.
