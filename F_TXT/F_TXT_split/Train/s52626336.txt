Again seen is moderate cardiomegaly, with prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The dual lead pacemaker is again noted, with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle. Mild interstitial edema is again seen, slightly more pronounced. There is new hazy opacity at the right lung base, which could represent a combination of pleural fluid and/or underlying collapse and/or consolidation. The left costophrenic sulcus is clear.
