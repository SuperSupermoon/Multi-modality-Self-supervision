There is a new consolidation at the right lung apex with sharp margins representing the fissure compatible with right upper lobe collapse. The extreme right lung apex is partially aerated. Hazy opacification at the right lung base likely reflects a small layering pleural effusion. The left lung base shows a small pleural effusion and mild degree of atelectasis, as before. The known right mediastinal mass is not well visualized due to right upper lobe collapse. No pneumothorax is appreciated. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is incompletely evaluated but likely unchanged.
