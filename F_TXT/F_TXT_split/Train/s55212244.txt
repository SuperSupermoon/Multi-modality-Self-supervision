Cardiac silhouette has increased in size and is accompanied by increasing width of the vascular pedicle as well as worsening vascular engorgement. These findings are accompanied by a bilateral asymmetrical airspace process involving the right lung more than the left with relative peripheral sparing. Combination of findings is most suggestive of asymmetrical pulmonary edema. Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful to document resolution and to exclude other underlying parenchymal process in the lungs.
