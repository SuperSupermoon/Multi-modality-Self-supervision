AP chest compared to ___ through 7:43 p.m.: A new nasogastric feeding tube with a wire stylet in place ends in the upper part of a non-distended stomach. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Leftward mediastinal shift suggests that heterogeneous opacification at the base of the left lung has a component of atelectasis, not surprising given recent tracheal extubation, but raises concern for aspiration. Clinical assessment advised. No pneumothorax.
