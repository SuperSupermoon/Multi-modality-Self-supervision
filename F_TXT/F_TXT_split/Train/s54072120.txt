AP chest compared to ___, There has been a change in the character of opacification in the right lower lung. Previously it had the quality of central mass and surrounding consolidation. Mass is appreciably smaller and the consolidation could be pneumonia or atelectasis. A new region of heterogeneous opacity in the left lung partially obscures the cardiac margin and could be a second focus of pneumonia. Upper lungs are grossly clear and pleural effusion, if any, is small. There is no large contour abnormality in the mediastinum to suggest adenopathy, heart size is normal and there is no mediastinal vascular engorgement to suggest cardiac tamponade.
