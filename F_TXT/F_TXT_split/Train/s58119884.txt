There is a worsening area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region, which could potentially be due to aspiration given the history of clinical suspicion for this entity. Lungs are otherwise remarkable for right lower lobe atelectasis, moderate elevation of right hemidiaphragm, and an apparent calcified granuloma in the left lung apex. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
