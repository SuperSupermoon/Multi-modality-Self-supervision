The PICC line tip is only minimally higher than on the prior exam and is in the distal SVC. There has been interval increase in the left pleural effusion which is now large in layering posteriorly with only a small amount of aerated lung in the superior left upper lobe. The right hemidiaphragm is obscured secondary to volume loss/ infiltrate/ effusion. This is a worsened appearance compared to prior.
