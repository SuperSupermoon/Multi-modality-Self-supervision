Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Multiple calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are again demonstrated. Superior hilar retraction with scarring in the lung apices are compatible with chronic changes from sarcoidosis. Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally is compatible with small bilateral pleural effusions, as seen on the prior study. Lungs are hyperinflated. No new focal consolidation is identified. There is no pneumothorax. No pulmonary vascular congestion is identified. The right humeral head prosthesis is partially imaged. Calcified breast implants are re- demonstrated.
