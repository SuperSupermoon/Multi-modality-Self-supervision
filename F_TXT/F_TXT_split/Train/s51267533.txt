A right-sided PICC line terminates in the distal SVC. There is persistent left retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting atelectasis. Right basilar atelectasis also noted. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. No definite pleural effusion seen although the left costophrenic angle is not well visualized. No pneumothorax seen.
