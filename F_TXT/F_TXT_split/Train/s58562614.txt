Right basilar and hilar opacities are consistent with increasing effusion and adjacent lung atelectasis. The right-sided chest tube appears kinked, and points towards the medial apical lung, unchanged compared to the prior exam. The lung volumes continue to be low. The heart demonstrates stable mild cardiomegaly. The ET tube terminates 45 mm above the carina. There is a left IJ which appears to be in appropriate position.
