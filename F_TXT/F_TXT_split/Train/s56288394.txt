There are still signs indicative of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, but these have improved as compared to the previous examination. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of newly occurred parenchymal opacities. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially indicative of a small left pleural effusion.
