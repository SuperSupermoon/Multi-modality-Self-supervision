The patient is status post sternotomy. Sutures are midline and intact. Additional postoperative changes evident in the right upper lung with chain sutures and relative lucency at the apex consistent with reported resection. Three additional surgical clips project over the right upper mediastinum. An additional 2 mm metallic density is in close proximity to this region and likely represents a surgical clip viewed on end; however, without a lateral view to confirm, shrapnel related to known gunshot wound is not excluded. No focal opacification concerning for pneumonia. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Faint asymmetry of lung base opacifications is likely related to scoliosis.
