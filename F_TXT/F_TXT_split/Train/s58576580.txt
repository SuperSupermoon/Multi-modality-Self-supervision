Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. New endotracheal tube terminates 6.8 cm above the carina. Enteric tube is in similar position to prior, below the diaphragm, with the side port in the area of the GE junction. Right lower lung atelectasis is similar to prior. Diffuse opacities overlying both lungs are similar to ___ and remain consistent with moderate right and large left pleural effusions. Potential lung abnormality underlying the effusions cannot be assessed on this view. Moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal contours are stable.
