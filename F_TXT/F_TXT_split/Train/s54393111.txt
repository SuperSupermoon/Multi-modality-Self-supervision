Comparison with the study of ___, there is further increase in opacification in the right hemithorax with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm. This could represent layering pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectatic changes. However, the possibility of a superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded, especially in the absence of a lateral view. Dense band of atelectasis is seen at the left base. There is some engorgement of pulmonary vessels, suggesting associated vascular congestion in a patient with a 8 top-normal or mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette. .
