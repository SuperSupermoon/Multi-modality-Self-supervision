The endotracheal tube ends 4.8 cm above the carina. A left chest wall AICD device is seen with leads in the expected position of the right atrium and right ventricle. The NG tube terminates in the proximal stomach. The heart is mildly enlarged. The hilar and mediastinal contours, are unremarkable except for mild aortic arch calcification. Mild pulmonary edema is seen. Bibasal opacities likely represent atelectasis. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Rounded calcific densities overlying the right upper abdomen, may represent gallstones or may be external to the patient.
