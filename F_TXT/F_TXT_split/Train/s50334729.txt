As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has been re-positioned. In any way, the pre-described coiling at the level of the pharynx is no longer visible. Also re-positioned is the right pigtail catheter in the pleural space. There is no right pneumothorax and no larger right pleural effusion. The amount of pleural fluid seen on the radiograph are limited to the lateral aspects of the right lower chest wall. Overall, the lung volumes have slightly decreased, and the size of the cardiac silhouette is constant. The bilateral pre-existing parenchymal opacities are of unchanged overall extent and severity.
