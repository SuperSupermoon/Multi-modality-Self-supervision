AP chest compared to ___: Small left pleural effusion has re-accumulated despite the presence of both pigtail and large-bore drainage catheters. There is no pneumothorax. Leftward mediastinal shift coupled with opacification in the lower lobe are indicative of severe persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. It is possible that this severe persistent left lower lobe consolidation marked by pronounced volume loss could be organized pneumonia rather than atelectasis alone. The multiple cavitary nodules demonstrated by recent chest CT are barely visible on conventional chest radiograph. Upper lobe shows vascular engorgement and mild edema, perhaps a function of recent collapse, or diminished ventilation retarding with clearance of lymphatics. Poor definition of the left lower bronchial airway suggests retained secretions or endobronchial obstruction.
