Exam is limited by low lung volumes, scoliosis and suboptimal positioning. With this limitation in mind, cardiomediastinal contours are grossly within normal limits. Lungs are clear except for predominately linear opacities at the left base favoring atelectasis over infectious pneumonia. Surgical clips in the upper paratracheal region may reflect previous thyroid surgery.
