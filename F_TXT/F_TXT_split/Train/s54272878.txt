AP chest compared to ___: Consolidation, mostly atelectasis, in the left lung has worsened substantially since ___. Poor definition of the left bronchial tree suggests retained airway secretions. Right infrahilar consolidation is less extensive than the process in the left hemithorax, but could represent another focus of atelectasis, less likely pneumonia. The heart is moderately enlarged. Left pleural effusion is probably substantial but exaggerated by adjacent atelectasis. Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Dr. ___ was paged at 10:45 a.m. when the study was reviewed.
