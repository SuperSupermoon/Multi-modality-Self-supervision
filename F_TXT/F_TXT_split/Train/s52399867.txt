As compared to prior chest x-ray, there are no interval changes. Lung volume is still low with persistent right lung opacification, consistent with combination of consolidation and pleural effusion and compatible with pneumonia. Unchanged left base opacity is likely atelectasis. Left subclavian PICC is also unchanged with tip ending in mid SVC.
