Patient is rotated to the left. There are likely bilateral pleural effusions. Left base opacity is likely due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, but underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to actually assessed given rib patient rotation, but the cardiac silhouette is likely top-normal to mildly enlarged.
