In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal tube now measures approximately 2.7 cm above the carina. NG tube extends at least to the upper stomach, where it crosses the inferior margin of the image. There is opacification at the left base with elevation of the hemidiaphragmatic contour. The appearance is consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels may reflect some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
