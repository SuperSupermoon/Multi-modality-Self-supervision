Interval increase in pleural-based peripheral opacities in the right hemithorax favoring increasing loculated pleural fluid and associated adjacent atelectasis or consolidation. Possible loculated small right apical pneumothorax. Right basilar chest tube remains in place. Linear opacity at the left base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning.
