Endotracheal tube remains in standard position, but tip of the nasogastric tube is not confidently visualized beyond the lower esophagus. Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by persistent diffuse airspace opacities affecting the right lung to a greater degree than the left. Many of the opacities have a nodular or mass-like quality, suggesting the possibility of septic emboli or fungal infection in the appropriate clinical setting. The right lung continues to be involved to a greater degree than the left. Probable bilateral pleural effusions appear similar to the prior study.
