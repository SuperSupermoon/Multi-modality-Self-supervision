There are diffuse patchy opacities throughout both lungs, particularly within the right lung base which have increased compared to the most recent prior examination. Given the absence of hilar indistinctness and vascular enlargement, findings are most suggestive of worsening multifocal pneumonia given the clinical history. In addition, moderate cardiomegaly is stable and no new pleural effusions are identified. Right humeral prosthesis appears similar to prior examination. Severe degenerative change of the left glenohumeral joint is unchanged.
