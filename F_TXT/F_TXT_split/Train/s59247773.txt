ET tube present, tip approximately 7.5 cm above the carina, at the mid clavicular heads. NG tube present, tip beneath diaphragm over stomach. Right IJ central line tip over mid SVC. No pneumothorax detected. Compared to the prior film, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The degree of engorgement and alveolar opacity has improved. However, this appearance is likely accentuated by differences in technique between the 2 films. Allowing for this, there is considerable residual interstitial and some basilar alveolar edema. No gross effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis also present.
