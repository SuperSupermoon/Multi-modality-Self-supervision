There is a similar right upper paramediastinal mass as well as a right perihilar mass, compared to prior radiographs, although small differences would be difficult to evaluate and would be better followed by CT imaging. The heart is at the upper limits of normal size. There is similar mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left. Although patchy opacities are present in the lower lungs, these are vague and streaky, most suggestive of minor atelectasis. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
