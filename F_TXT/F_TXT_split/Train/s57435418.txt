An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating at the origin of the right main stem bronchus. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the side hole in the distal esophagus. The inspiratory lung volumes are low. Linear opacity in the left lower lung zone likely reflects plate-like atelectasis. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is seen.
