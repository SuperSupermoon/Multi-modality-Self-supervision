Single AP portable view of the chest. No prior. There is linear opacity at the right lung base most suggestive of atelectasis. Elsewhere, the lungs are clear, without visualized effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. The osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
