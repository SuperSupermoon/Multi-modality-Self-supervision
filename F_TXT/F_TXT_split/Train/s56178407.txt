ET tube appears to been removed. 2 orogastric type tubes are present. 1 Extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film. Linear radiodensity could represent the tip of acute Dobbhoff tube. If so, it overlies the gastric fundus. Right IJ central line tip overlies distal SVC. No pneumothorax detected. There are low inspiratory volumes, likely accentuating the cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular markings. Allowing for this, cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. This appears slightly more pronounced than on the prior study. Possible small left effusion. There is increased retrocardiac density, with air bronchograms, consistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to prior. There is patchy opacity at the right base.
