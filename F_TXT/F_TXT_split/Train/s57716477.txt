Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion and apparent pattern of asymmetrical pulmonary edema in the right juxta hilar region. Alternatively, pneumonia coexisting with edema is possible. Worsened left retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or consolidation. Small left and moderate right pleural effusions are again demonstrated.
