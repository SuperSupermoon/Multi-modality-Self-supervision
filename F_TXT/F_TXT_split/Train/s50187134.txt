There is been interval placement of a right-sided central venous catheter. This catheter courses more midline than would be expected for the superior vena cava and projects over the ascending aorta straightening question of arterial placement. The lungs are hyperexpanded, but grossly clear. Biapical scarring and right hilar retraction are again noted, with together with slight tenting of the right hemidiaphragm. No gross pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. The left lung base lies at the edge of the film is not well visualized. The possibility of a small effusion and atelectasis at the left base would be difficult to exclude on this view. The heart is not enlarged.
