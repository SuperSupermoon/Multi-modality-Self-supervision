Moderate right pleural effusion is larger today than on ___. Right lower lobe is still collapsed, accounting for persistent rightward mediastinal shift. CT scan showed considerable central adenopathy and severe narrowing of the bronchus intermedius. Left lung is clear aside from retained aspirated barium demonstrating a grossly normal bronchial tree. Stigmata of remote trauma to the chest cage include healed left rib fractures and spinal stabilization hardware. I do not see evidence of COPD on the chest CTA, but the retained barium and air were suggests problems with aspiration.
