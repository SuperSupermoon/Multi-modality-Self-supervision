The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The lung volumes remain low. There are persistent patchy opacities in the lower lungs, but somewhat better aerated and expanded, suggesting partial resolution of what is probably, at least predominantly, atelectasis. Background prominence of pulmonary vascularity with indistinct vessels suggests fluid overload. A curvilinear shadow continues to project over the right upper lung. Lung markings are clearly seen beyond it, but it is difficult to entirely exclude the possibility of a pneumothorax involving partial retraction of the right upper lobe, although doubted. There is no free air.
