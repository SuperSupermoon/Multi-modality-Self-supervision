Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is an orogastric tube whose distal tip and side port are in the fundus of the stomach. This could be advanced 5 to 10 cm for more optimal placement as the sideport is near the GE junction. Heart size is within normal limits. Lungs are grossly clear. There is an unremarkable bowel gas pattern in the upper portion of the abdomen.
