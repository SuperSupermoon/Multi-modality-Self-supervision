A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal allowing for patient position and technique. No displaced rib fracture is identified, although CT is more sensitive for the detection of intrathoracic injury.
