In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again are relatively low lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Specifically, there probably is minimal elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Left basilar opacification is again consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss the left lower lobe. Superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Little change in the appearance of the dialysis catheter.
