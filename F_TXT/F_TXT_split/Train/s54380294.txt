AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph was obtained. The patient has been intubated with the tip of the ET tube located at least 2.7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is also seen with its tip in the left upper abdomen. Since the prior exam, there has been interval development of diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, predominantly ground-glass and nodular, most likely indicative of pulmonary edema. In addition, there are likely small bilateral effusions, hilar engorgement is also noted. Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable. Bony structures intact.
