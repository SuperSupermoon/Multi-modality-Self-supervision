Collapse of the lingula has resolved, and atelectasis in the left lower lobe has probably improved. There is worsening right basal atelectasis even though overall right lung volume has increased. Heart is normal size. New mild widening of the mediastinum suggests increased central venous pressure or volume, but there is no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
