Severe bilateral consolidation is more extensive today than yesterday, presumably worsening pneumonia. Accompanying small to moderate pleural effusions are larger. Heart size normal unchanged. No pneumothorax. ET tube, left subclavian line in standard placements and an upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
