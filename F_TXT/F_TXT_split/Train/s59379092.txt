Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn slightly but still appears low in position, terminating at the carina. Recommend withdrawal by approximately 3 cm for more optimal positioning. Enteric tube continues to course below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. There are low lung volumes. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Spinal hardware is again seen. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No definite focal consolidation.
