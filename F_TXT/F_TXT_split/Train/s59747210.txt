The ET tube appears in satisfactory position with the tip terminating 3.6 cm above the carina. The left diaphragm is obscured, new since prior study which likely represents atelectasis. The right lung is clear. An enteric tube is partially visualized but the tip is not clearly identified. A left chest AICD and leads are in unchanged positions. Valvular prosthesis, mediastinal clips and median sternotomy wires are again noted.
