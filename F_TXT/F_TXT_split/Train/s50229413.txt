Following placement of a right pigtail pleural catheter, large partially loculated right pleural effusion has decreased in size, particularly in the lower right hemithorax near the catheter. In this same region, focal hyperlucency likely represents a loculated pneumothorax. Extensive right upper lobe consolidation has worsened in the interval. Right mid and lower lung atelectasis adjacent to the loculated effusion have improved with residual opacity which could reflect combination of resolving atelectasis and reexpansion edema, although additional site of infection is possible in the setting of right upper lobe pneumonia. Large left loculated pleural effusion and adjacent left mid and lower lung atelectasis are unchanged.
