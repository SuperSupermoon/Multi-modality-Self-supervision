Lordotic positioning, with low inspiratory volumes. The lower lateral left hemidiaphragm and left costophrenic angle are excluded from the film. Compared to the prior study, the right IJ central line has been removed. Again seen is a dual lead pacemaker type device, with 1 lead tip over the right atrium. The second lead does not appear changed, but the distal tip is excluded from the film. Allowing for considerable differences in positioning, no definite change is identified. As noted, the lateral half of the left hemidiaphragm and left costophrenic angle are excluded from the film. Upper zone redistribution is noted, but doubt overt CHF. No focal consolidations seen in the visualized portion of the lung. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, without gross right effusion. Incidental note made of findings consistent with a chronic left shoulder rotator cuff tear.
