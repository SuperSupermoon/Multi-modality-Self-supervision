Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC. The right-sided chest tube is in unchanged position. There is continued evidence of volume loss in the right lung with slight interval increase in size of the small right pleural effusion. Right upper lung field opacification is compatible with patient's known lung cancer with loculated pleural fluid noted along the apex and adjacent postobstructive atelectasis and possible pneumonia. Left lung is clear. No pneumothorax is identified. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
