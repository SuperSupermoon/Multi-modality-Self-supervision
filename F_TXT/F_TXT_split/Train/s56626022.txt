A portable supine frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, enteric tube descending below the diaphragm in off the inferior edge of the image, right PICC terminating in the low SVC, and a right pigtail catheter overlying the right base. Lung volumes are slightly lower compared to prior chest radiograph, with increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. A loculated right pleural collection is similar to the prior chest radiograph. No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
