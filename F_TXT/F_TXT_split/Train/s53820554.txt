This radiograph was obtained for assessment of a feeding tube, which terminates within the stomach. As compared to the previous study, perihilar edema has slightly improved, left lower lobe atelectasis is persistent, and right lower lobe atelectasis has substantially improved. Small pleural effusions are again demonstrated, with interval improvement on the right.
