Single portable supine view of the chest reveals endotracheal tube that terminates in the left mainstem bronchus and should be retracted for better positioning. The lung volumes are low which cause vascular crowding. The low lung volumes may also be contributing to the right lower lobe opacities, although aspiration is certainly a consideration as well. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present. Heart size is normal.
