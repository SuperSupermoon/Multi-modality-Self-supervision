Portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates median sternotomy wires as well as prosthetic aortic valve, in appropriate position. The heart size appears mildly enlarged, and there is bilateral perihilar haziness as well as increased prominence of the interstitial markings within the bilateral lungs, consistent with pulmonary edema. There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, which obscures the left heart border, and underlying infection cannot be completely excluded, however no focal pneumonia is identified. Bibasilar atelectasis is present. Surgical clips are present in the upper mid abdomen as well as over the right chest wall, presumably from prior mastectomy.
