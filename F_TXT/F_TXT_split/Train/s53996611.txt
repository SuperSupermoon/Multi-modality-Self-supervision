In comparison with study of ___, there has been surgical procedure with right chest tube in place. The lung appears to be quite well expanded and there is no definite pneumothorax. Of course, the most superior portion of the right apex is somewhat obscured by overlying bony structures, so that a tiny pneumothorax cannot be excluded. There appears to be increased fullness of the pulmonary vascularity. Although some of this could reflect the portable rather than upright technique, some element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure should be considered. Resection of a portion of what appears to be the sixth posterior rib on the right is seen. There is increased prominence of the mediastinum, especially at the hilar level. Some of this could reflect postoperative changes, though again the portable technique and size of the patient could be influencing this appearance.
