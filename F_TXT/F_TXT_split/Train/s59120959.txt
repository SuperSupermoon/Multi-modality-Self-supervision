The study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. Allowing for this limitation, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Subsegmental atelectasis in the right lung base is present. Remote bilateral rib fractures present.
