An irregularity in the left anterolateral third rib better appreciated on the preceding study may represent a nondisplaced fracture. The known T11 fracture cannot be assessed on this study. Low inspiratory lung volumes with slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is likely due to suboptimal inspiration with associated atelectasis at the left lung base. The lungs are otherwise clear without large pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
