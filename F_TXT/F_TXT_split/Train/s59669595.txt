Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided. A single-lead pacemaker is again seen projecting over the left chest wall and lead extending to the region of the right ventricle. Lung volumes are low. Bronchovascular crowding likely accounts for mild left basilar opacity, though atelectasis versus mild aspiration difficult to exclude in the correct clinical setting. The aorta appears unfolded. The heart size is stable. No definite bony injury is seen.
