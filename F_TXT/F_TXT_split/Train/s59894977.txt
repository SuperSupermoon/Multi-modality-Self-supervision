Enteric tube is seen terminating in the mid hemithorax to the left of midline and may be within the mid-to-distal esophagus with side port above the level of the carina. Recommend repositioning so that it terminates within the stomach. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 9.5 cm above the level of the carina, somewhat high in position. Dual-lead right-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending in expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. The patient is rotated somewhat to the left. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. There are left greater than right subtle perihilar opacities which may be due to mild edema, although infectious process or aspiration is not excluded, particularly on the left.
