Compared with earlier the same day, the left apical pneumothorax is still small, but considerably larger. The pneumothorax component at the left base also appears slightly larger. Minimal lucency adjacent to the lateral aspect of the aortic knob may also represent part of the left lung pneumothorax, though continued attention to this area to assess for any mediastinal air is requested. Again seen is extensive subcutaneous emphysema along the left chest wall, left pectoralis, and left supraclavicular region. The left chest tube appears similar in appearance, though the sideport now overlies the cardiac silhouette (previously overlying the mid lung, just above the edge of the heart). The right-sided pneumothorax is also slightly larger, now seen tracking from the right apex along the right wall to the right costophrenic angle and adjoining right lung base. There is minimal atelectasis, but no significant collapse, on the right. The mediastinum remains grossly midline. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the prior study. Retrocardiac opacity is similar to the prior film. Doubt CHF.
