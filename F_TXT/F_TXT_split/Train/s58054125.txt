Slightly oblique positioning. Compared with ___ at 18:01 p.m., the ET tube has been advanced and now lies approximately 5.7 cm above the carina, at the lower edge of the medial clavicular heads. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is cardiomegaly, upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, and bibasilar opacities, probably with small bilateral effusions. Deformity of the right posterior sixth and seventh ribs is again noted consistent with rib fractures, probably not acute.
