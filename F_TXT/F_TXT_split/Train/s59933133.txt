In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a Dobbhoff tube with its opaque tip just distal to the esophagogastric junction. This could be pushed forward several centimeters. The left hemidiaphragm is now sharply seen, consistent with clearing of the lower lobe atelectasis and possible effusion. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
