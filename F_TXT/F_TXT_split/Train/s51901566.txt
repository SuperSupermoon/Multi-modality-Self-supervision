As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient shows unchanged monitoring and support devices. The relatively extensive bilateral pleural effusions are almost unchanged in extent and severity. The subsequent areas of atelectasis are also unchanged. However, the lung volumes are slightly increased, potentially is a reflection of increased ventilatory pressure. The signs indicative of pulmonary edema have minimally decreased in severity. No new parenchymal opacities.
