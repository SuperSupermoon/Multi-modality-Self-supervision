Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent opacity at the left base, which likely represents atelectasis in the setting of recent chest tube. Lung volumes are slightly low, which results in bronchovascular crowding. Heart remains mildly enlarged. A left-sided subclavian Port-A-Cath tip ends in the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
