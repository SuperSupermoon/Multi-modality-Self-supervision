Since the prior radiograph, there has been progression of bilateral diffuse patchy opacities, most marked in the left peripheral mid and lower lung zones. Given the rapid progression, this is most consistent with new edema. Alternatively, could be due to infection, a toxic or allergic drug reaction or hemorrhage. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. The heart size is stable. Surgical clips are noted in the right upper abdomen.
