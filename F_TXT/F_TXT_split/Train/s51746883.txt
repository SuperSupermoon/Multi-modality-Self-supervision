A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes resulting in bronchovascular crowding and prominence of the cardiac silhouette. Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is again calcification of the aortic knob. No focal consolidation is identified. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis or scarring. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
