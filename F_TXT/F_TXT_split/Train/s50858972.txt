1. Interval placement of a right subclavian central line which has its tip in the proximal right atrium. A pullback of 2-3 cm would be advised to place the tip in the distal SVC. Right chest tube remains in place. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There continues to be diffuse bilateral airspace disease which may reflect pulmonary hemorrhage, contusion or aspiration. The right lateral hemidiaphragm is less well visualized on current study either reflecting worsening airspace process or interval appearance of a pleural effusion. No large pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Results of this examination were communicated to ___, the patient's nurse on ___ at 9:55 a.m. by phone at the time of discovery.
