Chest radiograph centered at thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessing a nasogastric tube, which terminates within the stomach. Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Worsening bibasilar atelectasis is present as well as a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. Left shoulder arthroplasty is noted with apparent medial displacement of humeral head with respect to glenoid, not fully evaluated on this chest radiograph exam with a similar position to prior chest x-ray of ___. Severe degenerative changes are present at the right shoulder. If warranted clinically, dedicated shoulder radiographs could be obtained.
