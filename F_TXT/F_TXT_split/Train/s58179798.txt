Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach, potentially slightly more proximal than on the prior study but still with the sidehole being distal to the gastroesophageal junction. The ET tube tip is 4.6 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. The left internal jugular line tip is at the junction of left brachiocephalic vein and SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Pulmonary edema appears to be progressed since the prior study associated with bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis.
