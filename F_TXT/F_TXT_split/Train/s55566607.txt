Interval intubation with the tip of the endotracheal tube 6.5 cm above the carina. A second small diameter tube is seen paralleling the feeding tube with the tip projecting 2 cm above the carina. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with tip not identified. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There are persistent bibasilar opacities, which on the left is associated with an effusion. This would favor atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No pneumothorax.
