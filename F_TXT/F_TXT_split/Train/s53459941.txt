Previously air-filled loops of bowel in the large hiatus hernia now fluid-filled, but I do not believe the hernia has been reduced to any significant degree. There is considerable atelectasis in the left lower lobe due to mass effect by the intrathoracic bowel lobes, probably the cause of the hypoxia. There is no pulmonary edema. Heart size obscured by the hernia is indeterminate.
