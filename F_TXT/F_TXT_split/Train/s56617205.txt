Tracheostomy is in place. Right PICC line tip is at the level of lower SVC. Pneumoperitoneum is demonstrated, seen on previous CTA and portable chest radiograph.

Bibasal areas of atelectasis, a left pleural effusion are unchanged but there is more of atelectatic component at the left lower lobe potentially reflecting progression of infectious process in this location.
