Compared to chest radiograph from ___, there is been interval placement of a second left chest tube with associated subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral chest wall. Previously visualized left pigtail catheter is in unchanged position. Lung volumes remain low. Linear opacity along the peripheral left lung is nonspecific, though could represent a loculated collection following pleural biopsy. No large pneumothorax identified. Mild atelectasis at the right base has somewhat increased, with interval development of plate-like atelectasis. Left basilar atelectasis is unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusions persist.
