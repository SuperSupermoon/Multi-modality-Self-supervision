ET tube tip lies approximately 2.8 cm above the carina. NG tube present, extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlies the main pulmonary artery, possibly near the origin of the right pulmonary artery. Left-sided battery pack with lead extending cephalad again noted. Right-sided central line tip overlies the distal SVC. There is relative paucity of vessels at the right lung apex, but this is similar to prior films and no definite pneumothorax identified. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Mild vascular plethora and atelectasis the lung bases again noted. Bibasilar atelectasis may be very slightly improved.
