Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding. The patient has an atypical position in this radiograph, which limits interpretation of this study. Atelectasis is seen at the bilateral bases, left worse than right. The cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged. There is no pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, definite pleural effusion, or consolidation.
