Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiomediastinal silhouette with mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Moderate pulmonary edema has almost resolved. Right lower lobe opacities, a combination of atelectases and small effusions, have improved. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity, a combination effusion and consolidation, is grossly unchanged. These opacities represent atelectases, but in the appropriate clinical setting pneumonia should be a consideration. ET tube is seen in standard position. NG tube is out of view below the diaphragm.
