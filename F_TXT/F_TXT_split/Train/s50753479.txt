An endotracheal tube is in-situ, this terminates 3.6 cm above the level of the carina. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. An nasoenteric tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm, this appears to lie in the stomach. There is a persistent right pleural effusion with associated airspace opacity consistent with the patient's known consolidation. The left-sided consolidation is not well seen. No pneumothorax seen. No free air under the diaphragm.
