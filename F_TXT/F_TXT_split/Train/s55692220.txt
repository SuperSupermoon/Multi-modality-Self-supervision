Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is somewhat low in position, terminating approximately 1.4 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen, extending below the level of the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the stomach, in appropriate position. There is diffuse increased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax which may be due to layering pleural effusion as well as blunting of the right costophrenic angle. There is increased lucency at the left costophrenic angle which may be due to overlying soft tissue/structure as a discrete line is seen extending external to the lung fields; however, a small underlying pneumothorax cannot be excluded and can be further evaluated on pending CT. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The aortic knob is calcified. The mediastinum is not widened. No displaced fracture is seen.
