There is a persistent lower lingular opacification that appears increased and new elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to the prior radiograph and CT. Background coarsening of lung markings suggests widespread chronic airway inflammation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including moderate unfolding of the thoracic aorta.
