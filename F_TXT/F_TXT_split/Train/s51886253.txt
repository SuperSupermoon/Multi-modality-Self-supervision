1. A right internal jugular Port-A-Cath remains in place with its tip in the proximal right atrium, unchanged. An aortic endograft remains in place. Lung volumes are lower in volume and there is crowding of the interstitium and vasculature in this patient with known underlying pulmonary fibrosis. No superimposed consolidation is appreciated to suggest an acute infectious process. No large effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. A small amount of air is seen in the right neck and shoulder soft tissues consistent with subcutaneous emphysema. Clinical correlation is advised.
