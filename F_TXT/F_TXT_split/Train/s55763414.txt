Tracheostomy tube is midline. No other cardiopulmonary support device is seen. The combination of dense consolidation and loculated pleural fluid filling the upper third of the left hemithorax is unchanged since ___, but substantially improved since the left lung was entirely collapsed on ___. Moderate cardiomegaly is present throughout and there is pulmonary vascular engorgement, but I doubt that pulmonary edema is present.Ventilator tubing occur over is much of the right upper lobe and would hide consolidation in that region. Subsequent chest radiograph should be taken with care to uncover the right lung.
