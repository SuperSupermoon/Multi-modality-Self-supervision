The endotracheal tube tip seats 5 cm above the carina. The endogastric tube courses inferiorly and out of field of view without clear visualization of the tip or side port. There has been interval placement of a right-sided IJ central venous catheter with its tip in the upper-to-mid SVC. Otherwise, the heart size is at the upper limits of normal with mediastinal contours still compatible with central vascular engorgement. The pulmonary perihilar opacities persist; slightly improved compared to prior exam. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or apical cap. Again, multiple healing rib fractures are present, primarily along the posterolateral aspect of the right thoracic rib cage.
