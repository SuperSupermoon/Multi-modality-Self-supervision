1. Left-sided pacer remains in place, although both lesions are not completely visualized on the current study. Lungs are low in volume with some crowding of the pulmonary vasculature, but there is no evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia or pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature likely related to the low lung volumes.
