Interval appearance of mild to moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema. Increasing more focal consolidation at the left lung base may be related to the pulmonary edema, although underlying pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. This can be better assessed on followup imaging. The cardiac mediastinal contours remain stably enlarged. No pneumothorax.
