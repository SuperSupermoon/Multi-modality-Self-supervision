Opacification of the right lung apex, a combination of known pneumonia and loculated pleural fluid appears increased since most recent prior. A chest tube remains in place within the right mid lung. Previously seen air adjacent to the chest tube site has decreased, likely due to improving loculated hydropneumothorax. Previously seen loculated fluid within the right basilar pleural space has decreased in the interval. However, within the adjacent right lower lobe, worsening consolidation is seen, which may be due to re-expansion pulmonary edema or progressiong of pneumonia. Aeration of the left lung with a large left loculated pleural effusion is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged and within normal limits. Pacemaker leads are intact and in standard position.
