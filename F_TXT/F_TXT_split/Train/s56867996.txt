Two chest tubes are seen on the left side, terminating near the left lung apex and another towards upper mediastinum. Following left upper lobectomy, the left hemithorax demonstrates expected changes of volume loss. Mild increase in the opacity in the left upper medial lung/mediastinum may reflect postoperative changes. Mediastinal shift to the left side and some diffuse haziness, is attributed to postoperative fluid. Right lung demonstrates mild compensatory hyperexpansion. The left lung opacity is obscuring the cardiomediastinal margins, detailed assessment of cardiomediastinal silhouette was limited. There is no pleural effusion on the right side. The catheter is seen terminating approximately at the mid thoracic level.
