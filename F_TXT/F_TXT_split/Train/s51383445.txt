As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. As a consequence, pre-existing areas of retrocardiac and left basal opacity appear slightly denser than before. However, extent of these areas has not increased, which makes atelectasis more likely than pneumonia. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged appearance of the monitoring and support devices.
