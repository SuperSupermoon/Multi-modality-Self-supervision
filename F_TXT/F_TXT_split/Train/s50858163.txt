1. Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. Left subclavian central line is unchanged in position. There are layering bilateral effusions with associated airspace opacities likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. There has been interval resolution of the pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning. No pneumothorax. Nodularity at the right apex is felt to be related to degenerative changes of superimposed bony structures.
