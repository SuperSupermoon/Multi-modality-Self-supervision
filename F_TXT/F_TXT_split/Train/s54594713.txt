AP chest compared to ___: Edema has substantially improved since ___, when there was mild edema throughout both lungs. Upper lungs have cleared, but there is greater opacification at both lung bases, particularly the right. It is hard to say whether this is a dependent migration of edema, coupled with atelectasis or if the patient is aspirating. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is no engorgement of mediastinal, pulmonary or hilar vasculature. Left PIC and right internal jugular lines both end low in the SVC and a nasogastric tube can be traced to the lower esophagus, although the tip is indistinct. ET tube in standard position. No pneumothorax.
