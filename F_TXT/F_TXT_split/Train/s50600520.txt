Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated, perhaps minimally increased from the previous study. Widening of the right paratracheal stripe is attributable to tortuous vessels, better assessed on the previous CT. Enlargement of the pulmonary artery is again noted suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. Lungs remain hyperinflated. There is mild pulmonary edema, new in the interval. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
