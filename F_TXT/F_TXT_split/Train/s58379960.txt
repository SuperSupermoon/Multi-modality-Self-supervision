Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Minimal patchy retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. There are no displaced fractures visualized.
