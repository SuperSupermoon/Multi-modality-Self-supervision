As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of pulmonary edema have minimally improved. This is most evident at the right mid and lower lung zones, where the lung has increased in transparency. However, signs of interstitial fluid overload are still present. The presence of minimal bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax. The monitoring and support devices are constant, including the position of the left pectoral pacemaker leads.
