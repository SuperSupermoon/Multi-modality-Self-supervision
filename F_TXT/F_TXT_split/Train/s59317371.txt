AP chest compared to ___: Mild generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality is new. Since there is no substantial change in longstanding mediastinal venous and pulmonary vascular engorgement, this might not be interstitial pulmonary edema, due instead to transfusion or drug reaction. Clinical correlation advised. Moderate cardiomegaly and dilated or tortuous ascending thoracic aorta are also chronic. Pleural effusions are small if any.
