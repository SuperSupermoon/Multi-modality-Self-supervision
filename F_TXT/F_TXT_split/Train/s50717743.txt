Comparison is made to the prior study performed 13 hours earlier. There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 5 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. There has been removal of the right IJ Cordis. There is a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the mid SVC. There is a feeding tube whose distal tip is below the gastroesophageal junction off the field of view of the study. There is again seen a left-sided pleural effusion and left retrocardiac opacity. Right mid lung zone atelectasis is also seen and stable. There are no pneumothoraces.
