Heterogeneous opacities along the medial aspect of the right lung base seen on prior CT from ___ are not well appreciated on the current study. Left lower lung heterogeneous opacities are not significantly changed compared to prior CT, thought to represent an area of aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. The remainder of the lungs is clear. Apparent enlargement of the heart is thought to be secondary to decreased lung volumes rather than true cardiomegaly. The mediastinal contours are normal. Trace pleural effusions seen on prior CT are not appreciated on the current radiograph. There is no pneumothorax. A new enteric catheter passes below the level of the diaphragm, then curves superiorly to end within the gastric cardia.
