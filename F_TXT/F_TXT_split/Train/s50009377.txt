The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged. Again noted is mild central pulmonary vascular congestion. The previously seen right internal jugular sheath is no longer noted. There is no pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion. No consolidation is identified. Increased conspicuity of opacity is seen at the right lung base, which may represent atelectasis, though consolidation is not excluded. An AICD is in appropriate, unchanged position.
