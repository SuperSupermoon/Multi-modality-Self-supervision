AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding portable supine chest examination obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day. On this portable frontal view, the patient is intubated. The ETT is seen to terminate in the trachea 4 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax is identified. A right internal jugular approach central venous line has been placed. Its tip reaches rather far into the region of the lower SVC and may terminate in the upper portion of the right atrium. Withdrawal of the line by 3 cm is recommended. This chest examination does not demonstrate any new pulmonary abnormalities. The heart size appears unaltered.
