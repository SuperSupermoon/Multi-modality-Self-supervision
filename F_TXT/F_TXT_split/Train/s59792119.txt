Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. There are unchanged findings as compared with prior radiograph from three days ago with stable right pleural effusion with probable associated compressive lower lobe atelectasis. There is a small left pleural effusion with subtle increase in left lower lobe consolidation, likely atelectasis. Please note pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. Heart size is difficult to assess but appears grossly stable, but mediastinal contour is unremarkable. Bony structures appear intact.
