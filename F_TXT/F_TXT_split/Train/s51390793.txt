Hardware is again seen overlying the cervical and upper thoracic spine. A left subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip terminate in the azygos vein. Repositioning has already been recommended on multiple prior studies. A tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. There is somewhat improved aeration at the left base with increasing streaky opacities at the right base suggestive of worsening atelectasis. Incidental note is made of an azygos lobe. Increased prominence of the perihilar vasculature suggests a component of superimposed edema at this time. No pneumothorax.
