A portable frontal chest radiograph redemonstrates a dual lead pacemaker with the leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle, and a nasogastric tube which is coiled within the stomach. The right central catheter is unchanged in position. Multifocal bilateral consolidations are severely increased, representing either pneumonia or asymmetric edema. Please note that the chest apex is excluded from the exam.
