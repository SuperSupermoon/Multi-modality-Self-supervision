There is similar widespread bilateral heterogeneous opacification, worse in the left upper lung, but elsewhere not significantly changed. Left infrahilar and retrocardiac opacification is prominent within the background of a widespread interstitial abnormality. Differential considerations include pneumonia, aspiration, or atelectasis perhaps coinciding with pulmonary congestion. There is a left-sided chest tube in place and a right-sided PICC line terminating in the lower superior vena cava. A feeding tube terminates in the stomach. Surgical clips project over the left upper quadrant. Findings are similar to the prior study.
