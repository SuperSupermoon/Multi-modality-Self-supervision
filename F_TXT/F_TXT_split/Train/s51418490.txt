No previous images available. There is a mass in the left perihilar and upper zone, presumably that which was involved in the bronchoscopy. No evidence of pneumothorax. Some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragms consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe. Apical capping is seen on the left, of uncertain etiology. There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels on the right, raising the possibility of asymmetric pulmonary edema.
