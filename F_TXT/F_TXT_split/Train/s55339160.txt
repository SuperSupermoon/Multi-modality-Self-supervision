Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. Left retrocardiac mass unchanged. Improving aeration at the bases with residual patchy opacities suggestive of resolving atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning between studies. No obvious pneumothorax or large effusions. Apparent curvilinear lucency projecting beneath the right hemidiaphragm and in the epigastric region are felt to more likely be artifactual rather than representing free intraperitoneal air given semi-erect positioning, but this can be better assessed on followup imaging. Multiple old left-sided rib fractures.
