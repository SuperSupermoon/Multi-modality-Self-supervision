As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. In unchanged manner, the overall small lungs are showing extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities, part of which is likely caused by pulmonary edema but part of which could also reflect multifocal pneumonia. This is particularly evident on the left, where a consolidated lateral lung area does not comply with the typical findings for pulmonary edema. The presence of small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded. Unchanged slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
