Previous moderate left pneumothorax has decreased substantially following insertion of a new basal thoracostomy tube. Severe atelectasis persists at both lung bases. Surprisingly, the previous moderate right pneumothorax is no longer evident. Postoperative widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette has imp increased since earlier in the day, but this may be a function of lower lung volumes. Upper lungs are clear.
