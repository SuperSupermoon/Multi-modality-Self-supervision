There is again seen a right-sided dialysis catheter whose distal tip projects over the lower SVC versus cavoatrial junction. This is likely in unchanged position and the appearance of a more distal location of the tip likely reflects decreased lung volumes in comparison to prior radiograph. There has been interval removal of endotracheal tube, as well as removal of previously seen NG tube. The cardio mediastinal contours are grossly unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There has been interval increase in opacification of the lower portion of the right upper lobe which may represent developing pulmonary edema, infection, or atelectasis. There is again redemonstrated a loculated left pleural effusion without significant interval change. Also again seen is a small right sided pleural effusion.
