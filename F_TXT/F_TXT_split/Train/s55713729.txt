Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates extensive diffuse pulmonary opacities, which have increased in size slightly over the interval, and are concerning for multifocal aspiration pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with adjacent atelectasis are also increased. Engorged central pulmonary vessels are consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Endotracheal tube ends 4.9 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view. Left-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and the superior vena cava.
