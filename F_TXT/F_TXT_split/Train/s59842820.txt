There has been interval placement of a right-sided IJ with the tip terminating in the mid SVC. There is an ET tube which is in appropriate position above the carina. There is an enteric tube which terminates appropriately below the diaphragm. Patchy bilateral airspace opacities, left greater than right, appear similar-to-slightly improved compared to the prior exam. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax; however, please note that the right costophrenic angle is not visualized on this exam. The aortic knob is calcified. The heart size is normal. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
