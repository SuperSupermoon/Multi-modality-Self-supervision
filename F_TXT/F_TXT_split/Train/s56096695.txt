CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. Rotated positioning. An ET tube is now present, the carina is not optimally visualized but the tip of the ET tube lies approximately 3.1 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. There is increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There has been slight interval improvement of opacity along the upper left chest wall. Mild upper zone redistribution. There is atelectasis at the right lung base. The right lung is otherwise clear. No significant right-sided effusion.
