Lung volumes are low which limits the evaluation. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature but no signs of pulmonary edema. A right chest wall port with catheter tip in the right atrium is new since the prior study. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Bones are intact.
