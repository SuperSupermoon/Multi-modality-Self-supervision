An endotracheal tube has been placed which terminates shortly below the thoracic inlet. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach, although its sidehole lies slightly above the gastroesophageal junction (at the time of interpreting this study it has already been adjusted at a subsequent film). The heart is moderately enlarged with persistent widespread airspace opacification suggesting pulmonary edema, although other potential differential considerations could include widespread pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome in the appropriate clinical setting. No definite pleural effusions are identified on this examination. There is no pneumothorax.
