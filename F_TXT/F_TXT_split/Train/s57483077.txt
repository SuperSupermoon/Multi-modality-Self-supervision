In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. Monitoring and support devices are stable, as is the heterogeneous and calcified right lower lobe opacity consistent with a pleural based mass that has been stable for at least ___ years. The cardiac silhouette is more prominent and there is increased opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm. This suggests some pleural fluid and volume loss in the lower lobe. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is again seen. It is difficult to assess the pulmonary vessels, though there may be mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
