Compared with the prior film, the patchy opacity previously seen left mid zone is slightly improved. Retrocardiac opacity, obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and small left effusion are similar. The left pleural effusion could be slightly decreased in the interval. There is prominent vascular plethora presumably reflecting CHF, though the appearance raises the possibility of some background parenchymal scarring. Small focal, peripheral, patchy opacities at the right base laterally are noted, similar prior. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is consistent with a small right effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Again seen is a left PICC line, with tip overlying the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is identified.
