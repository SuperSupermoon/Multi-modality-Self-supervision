Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately the 3.3 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, distal aspect not included on the image. Right perihilar opacity may relate to atelectasis or consolidation from aspiration, less likely infection. The left lung is clear. No large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace effusion may be difficult to exclude. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
