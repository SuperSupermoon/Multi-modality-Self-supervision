Large left-sided pleural effusion has increased in size compared to the prior studies. Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and the left heart border from collapse of the left lower lobe and lingula is seen, and shift of mediastinum to the left is more prominent. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Right lung appears well expanded and clear without focal consolidation. There is no right-sided pleural effusion.
