As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, left pleural effusion and retrocardiac atelectasis. On today's radiograph, the presence of a minimal right pleural effusion, limited to the right costophrenic sinus, cannot be excluded. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
