Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Left chest tube remains in place with increasing, now moderate-sized left pleural effusion, as well as a possible small left apical pneumothorax, difficult to assess due to overlap of soft tissue structures in the left apex. Attention to this region on a repeat radiograph with improved positioning would be helpful in this regard. Worsening left lower lobe atelectasis adjacent to the left pleural effusion. Persistent small right pleural effusion and adjacent right basilar lung atelectasis.
