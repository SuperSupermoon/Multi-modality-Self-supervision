A left subclavian PICC line is present, tip over distal SVC, similar to the prior film. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not significantly changed. Patchy opacity at the right base is considerably improved compared with the prior film, though slight residual opacity is present. Minimal hazy opacity at the left base is similar to the prior film. This could reflect mild atelectasis, scarring, or possibly a site of prior aspiration. No new focal infiltrate is identified to suggest a new site of pneumonia or pneumonitis. No CHF and no gross effusion identified.
