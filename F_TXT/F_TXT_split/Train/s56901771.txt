Single AP portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates the nasogastric tube curled in the stomach. The right internal jugular catheter is unchanged in position. The endotracheal tube is also unchanged in position. The bilateral asymmetric opacities are seen, worse on the right, which likely represent pulmonary edema. The left lung appears to have increased in opacity compared to the prior radiograph. Marked cardiomegaly is noted. No pneumothorax is identified.
