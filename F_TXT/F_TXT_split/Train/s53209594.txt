As compared to the previous examination, the pre-existing massive bilateral parenchymal opacities and consolidations have decreased in extent and severity. However, the opacities are still clearly visible and predominates in the perihilar areas. The opacities are the compound mild on the right by a moderate pleural effusion that has not substantially changed. Moderate cardiomegaly persists and the cardiac silhouette can now better be delineated than on the previous image. The endotracheal tube has been pulled back, the tip now projects 5.5 cm above the carina. The course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged, the tip is not included on the image. Widening of the mediastinal angle suggests enlargement of the left atrium.
