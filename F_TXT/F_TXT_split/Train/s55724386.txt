In comparison with study of ___, there are substantially lower lung volumes with prominent elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour. Right chest tube extends to the apex before passing downward. There appears to be a small right apical pneumothorax. There are dense streaks of opacification in the left upper zone that were not definitely seen on previous study. This is a somewhat unusual position for atelectasis but does not have the characteristic appearance of aspiration. This region should be closely followed on subsequent radiographs.
