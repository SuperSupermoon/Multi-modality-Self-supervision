The heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The lung volumes are low resulting in bibasilar atelectasis. There has been interval placement of a fiducial in the right lower lung with surrounding ground-glass opacity representing hemorrhage. A small apical pneumothorax is present on the right with the uppermost portion of the visualized right lung apex projecting just below the right third posterior rib. There is no mediastinal shift or diaphragmatic flattening to suggest tension.
