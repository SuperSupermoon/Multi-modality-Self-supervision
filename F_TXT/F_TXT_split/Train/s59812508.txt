Right PICC line tip near cavoatrial junction. Shallow inspiration. Right pleural effusion is stable. Elevated right hemidiaphragm, component of subpulmonic effusion is possible, stable. Increased right perihilar, basilar opacity, likely atelectasis given shallow inspiration, consider pneumonitis if clinically appropriate. Stable left retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis, with adjacent small effusion. Postoperative changes spine. Normal heart size, pulmonary vascularity. No pneumothorax. Tubing projected over right abdomen. Degenerative changes spine, with thoracolumbar curve.
