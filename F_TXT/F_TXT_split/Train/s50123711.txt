There has been significant improvement in the left-sided effusion with more aerated left lung, particularly at the apex. Left pleural catheter projects at the left lung base. Heterogeneous opacity in the left mid lung corresponds to tumor better seen by CT. The right lung is clear and there is likely a small right pleural effusion. Left PICC terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction.
