CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Lordotic positioning. An ET tube is present -- the tip lies at the level of the upper clavicles, 4.7 cm above the carina. Two NG type tubes are present, both extending beneath the diaphragm off the film. Right IJ central line and left subclavian central lines are present, tip over mid SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Small radiodensities over the upper mediastinum may represent artifact or surgical clips. There are low inspiratory volumes. Mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette may be due to this. There is a small-to-moderate left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. Minimal atelectasis at the right base, with equivocal blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Mild upper zone redistribution and slight vascular blurring consistent with CHF, but likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Compared with ___ at 4:39 a.m., I doubt significant interval change.
