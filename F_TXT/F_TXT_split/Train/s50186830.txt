In comparison with the study of ___, there has been mild decrease in the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion, though some of this could merely reflect the greater degree of inspiration. Increased silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm with basilar opacification, consistent with layering effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis. Less prominent effusion atelectasis on the left. Again, it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
