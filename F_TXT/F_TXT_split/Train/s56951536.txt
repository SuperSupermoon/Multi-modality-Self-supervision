AP chest compared to ___: As far as one can tell from a solitary frontal view, the right transjugular pacer lead has been withdrawn, still projecting over the mid portion of the right ventricular cavity inferiorly. Lateral view is still needed for more reliable localization. Course of the pacer lead suggests less displacement from the trachea. If there was a hematoma, it is smaller. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart size is normal and the lungs are clear.
