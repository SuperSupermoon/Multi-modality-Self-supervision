AP portable upright view of the chest. Overlying EKG leads are present somewhat limiting assessment. Evaluation is limited due to underpenetrated technique especially at the level of the lung bases. Allowing for technical limitations, the lungs appear clear though hyperinflated with upper lung lucency suggestive of underlying emphysema. The cardio mediastinal silhouette is notable for mild prominence of the main pulmonary artery likely reflective of pulmonary hypertension. No definite signs of pneumonia or edema. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Imaged bony structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
