The heart remains moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Patchy opacities within the lung bases may reflect atelectasis. There is likely a trace left pleural effusion, but this has decreased compared to the prior study. Previously noted small right pleural effusion is not clearly demonstrated on the current exam. No pneumothorax is definitively noted. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
