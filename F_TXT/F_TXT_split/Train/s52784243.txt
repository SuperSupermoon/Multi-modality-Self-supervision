As compared to the previous radiograph, there has been placement of an orogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable. The tip is not visualized on the image. The other monitoring and support devices are constant. Constant low lung volumes, with likely moderate pulmonary edema and areas of atelectasis, notably in the retrocardiac lung region. No new focal parenchymal opacities. Mild cardiomegaly and blunting of the left costophrenic sinus persist.
