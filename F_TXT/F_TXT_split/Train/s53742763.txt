A single AP upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates asymmetric pulmonary edema greater on the right than the left. There is slightly increased opacification of the left lung base which obscures the left hemidiaphragm compared to the prior study and may represent a small left pleural effusion or atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable and within normal limits. Biliary drains are in place in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. A device is also located in the abdomen, which may be external to the patient or alternatively may represent a nerve stimulator.
