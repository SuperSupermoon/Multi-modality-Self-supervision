Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Right chest tube has been removed . A left chest tube remains in place. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard position. Left IJ catheter tip is at the confluence of the left internal jugular vein and subclavian vein. Right subclavian catheter tip is obscured by sternal hardware material, appears to be in the lower SVC. NG tube tip is in the stomach. There are low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is worsening mild vascular congestion. Left upper lobe opacity has increased, likely atelectasis. Left lower lobe retrocardiac atelectases have increased. Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged allowing the difference in position of the patient.
