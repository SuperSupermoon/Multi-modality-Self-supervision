Lung volumes are increased with hyperlucency of upper lobes in keeping with emphysema. Bilateral lower lobe heterogeneous opacities affecting the left lung to a greater degree than the right show interval improvement, particularly at the left lung base. An apparent subpulmonic left pleural effusion may be slightly smaller compared to the prior study. No new areas of lung consolidation are evident in the remainder of the lungs.
