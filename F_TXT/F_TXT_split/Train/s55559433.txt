A left internal jugular central line ends in the upper SVC. A fracture of the most superior sternal wire is unchanged. The other sternal wires are intact. A sharp interface projecting over the lateral right lung is likely a skinfold, but a repeat chest radiograph carefully positioned should be able to exclude pneumothorax. The moderate right pleural effusion is smaller. Moderate pulmonary edema has slightly improved. Septic emboli--___ peripheral nodules, some cavitary--___ stable. No new nodules or consolidations are present. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged and unchanged.
