As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of the two right-sided chest tubes and the pre-existing monitoring and support devices. The heart continues to be enlarged and a relatively large retrocardiac atelectasis is seen. The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No new parenchymal opacities are present. No evidence of pulmonary edema. The lung bases on the right are more transparent than on the previous image, potentially reflecting improved ventilation.
