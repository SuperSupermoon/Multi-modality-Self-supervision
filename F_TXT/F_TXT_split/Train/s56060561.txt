Following removal of left-sided chest tube, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Left upper lobe mass and central left mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy appear similar to the prior study. New patchy bibasilar opacities may reflect patchy atelectasis or aspiration. Unchanged small left and new small right pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
