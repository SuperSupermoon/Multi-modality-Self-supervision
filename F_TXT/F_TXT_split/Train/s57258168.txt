In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. Widening of the superior mediastinum is again seen, consistent with thyroid goiter better visualized on the recent CT study. The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size or mildly enlarged with minimal if any elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the left base is consistent with a combination of volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be extremely difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view. Streaks of atelectasis with blunting of the costophrenic angle are seen at the right base.
