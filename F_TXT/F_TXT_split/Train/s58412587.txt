Compared with prior radiograph there is significant interval worsening, with new focal opacities in the right lower lung projecting over the costophrenic angle as well as new focal opacities projecting over the chronically coarse interstitial opacities in the right upper lung. Overall the interstitial markings are more prominent than in prior, suggesting superimposed interstitial edema. Large emphysematous bullae are redemonstrated in the left lower lung. There may be a small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified. Cardiac size is mildly enlarged and unchanged.
