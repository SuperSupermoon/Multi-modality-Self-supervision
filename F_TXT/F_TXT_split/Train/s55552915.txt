There is been interval removal of an endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz catheter and multiple mediastinal and pleural drains. Lung volumes are somewhat low which accentuates bronchovascular markings. Subtly increased opacity at the base of the right lung likely reflects atelectasis. No pleural effusions. Opacity in the mid left lung at the base of the left lung likely reflect atelectasis. There is a tiny right apical pneumothorax.
