Interval repositioning of the left subclavian PICC line which now has its tip near the cavoatrial junction. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. There are bibasilar airspace opacities, which may reflect aspiration or pneumonia given the current clinical setting; however, as the pulmonary vasculature appears ill-defined, this also could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema. Therefore, clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pneumothorax. No large pleural effusions are appreciated.
