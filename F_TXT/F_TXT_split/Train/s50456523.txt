As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of moderate pulmonary edema have increased in extent and severity. Cardiomegaly has also increased. Pre-existing blunting of the costophrenic sinuses is more obvious than on the previous image and suggests the presence of small pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. No pneumonia.
