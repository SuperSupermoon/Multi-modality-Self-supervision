As compared to the previous radiograph, the mediastinal drains, the Swan-Ganz catheter, the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube have been removed. There is no evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax. The lung volumes have slightly decreased, causing slightly more atelectasis at the lung bases. The appearance of the postoperative cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No larger pleural effusions.
