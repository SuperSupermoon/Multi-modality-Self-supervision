The ET tube is 4 cm above the carina. Right IJ line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. There is volume loss at both bases, most marked on the right with an elevated right hemidiaphragm. An infiltrate in the right lower lung cannot be excluded. There is also increased opacity in the left lung laterally. It is unclear if this represents overlying soft tissues or an infiltrate. The right-sided PICC line has been removed. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution. Compared to the prior exam, the elevated right hemidiaphragm and appearance of the right lower lung are worsened.
