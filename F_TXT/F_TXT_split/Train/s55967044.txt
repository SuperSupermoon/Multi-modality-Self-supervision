AP chest compared to ___, 12:14 p.m.: An upper enteric drainage tube is coiled in the lower esophagus. Second tube passes into the stomach and out of view. The external portion for one of the tubes loops over the midline, making it difficult to see the course of the internal devices. Left lower lobe collapse and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion are unchanged. Atelectasis of the right lung base is mild. Severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement are chronic and the pulmonary vasculature is more dilated today than before, although there is no pulmonary edema. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC.
