Left subclavian Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position. Interval removal of the nasogastric tube. Layering bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with associated predominantly right sided patchy airspace process which may reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Interval improved aeration in the retrocardiac region. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Tiny left apical nodular opacities likely correspond to pleural irregularity on the coronal images from the chest CT dated ___.
