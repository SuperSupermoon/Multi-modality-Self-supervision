A column of barium persists within the distal neoesophagus, overall similar to the recent radiograph when allowances are made for differences in technique and projection. The neoesophagus remains distended proximally. Moderate right pleural effusion and adjacent right mid and lower lung opacity appear similar. Left lung is clear except for improving atelectasis at the left base.
