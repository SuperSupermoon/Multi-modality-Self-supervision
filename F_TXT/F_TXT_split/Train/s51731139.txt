Small volume of pleural fluid in the left lower chest and atelectasis in the left lower lung have both improved. Very small apical pneumothorax is slightly smaller. The absence of fluid levels suggests that the major the components of air and fluid are not in free communication, due to loculations. Lung volumes have improved generally but there is still platelike atelectasis in the right lower lobe as well. Heart size is normal.
