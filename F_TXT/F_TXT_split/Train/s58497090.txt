Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a stable midline tracheostomy tube. Again seen is partially calcified right lower lobe pleural and parenchymal opacity, similar to the prior examinations, and more fully characterized on concurrent abdominal CT lung images of the same date. No definite new focal consolidation is identified. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is chronic and unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. A right-sided central catheter terminates in the mid SVC. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
