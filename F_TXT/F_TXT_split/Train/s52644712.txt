In compares to prior study of 1 day earlier, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Moderate right pleural effusion appears similar to the prior study with adjacent slight improvement in right lower lung opacification. On the left, a small effusion has apparently slightly increased in size with adjacent worsening left retrocardiac opacification. No other relevant change.
