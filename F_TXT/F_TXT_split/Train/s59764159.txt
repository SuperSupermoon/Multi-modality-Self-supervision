The left costophrenic angle is excluded from this examination. A right IJ catheter terminates at the mid the upper SVC. A left IJ central venous catheter terminates at the lower SVC. An endotracheal tube appears to terminate at the level of the thoracic inlet. An transesophageal tube is not well visualized beyond the mid thorax due to overlapping soft tissues. There appears to be a second transesophageal catheter, which may have been retracted to the midesophagus. There is a left-sided cardiac pacemaker. Sternal wires are intact. No new pulmonary consolidation is detected. There is no pneumothorax or large effusion.
