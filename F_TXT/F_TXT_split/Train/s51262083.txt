AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. On the present examination, the patient is slightly rotated to the right, which accounts for somewhat different presentation of the tracheostomy cannula. It is seen to terminate in unchanged position in the trachea. No pneumothorax is present. The heart size remains unchanged and is within normal limits. No pulmonary congestive pattern and no new acute infiltrates. Lateral pleural sinuses remain free.
