Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained. There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube with the tip terminating 4.3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube has also been placed with the tip terminating in the gastric fundus. There is a dense opacity seen in the right upper lung with associated rightward tracheal deviation, which is concerning for right upper lobe collapse. In the right lung base there is now a new opacity which may be due to aspiration or hemorrhage. The previously seen left upper and lower lobe opacities have improved although minimal persistent patchy opacity is seen in the left lung base. There is no pneumothorax.
