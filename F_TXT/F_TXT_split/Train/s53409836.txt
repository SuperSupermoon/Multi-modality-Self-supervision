An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, 4.8 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is present with the tip in the stomach. A right internal jugular central venous catheter is present with the tip in the mid SVC. Again, there are bilateral parenchymal opacities, predominantly at the bases, which are in keeping with an infectious process. Additionally, there are worsening interstitial opacities, suggesting worsening edema. A small left pleural effusion appears grossly stable. A small right pleural effusion has likely slightly increased in size. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
