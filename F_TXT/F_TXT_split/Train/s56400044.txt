1. COPD and stable cardiomegaly. 2. New small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Possibility of a pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded. 3. Upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. Mild diffuse prominence of the interstitial markings is noted, while this could relate to mild interstitial edema, it is less pronounced than on the earlier film and may represent background parenchymal scarring. 4. Subsegmental atelectasis at the left base and small right effusion similar to prior. 5. Prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissues apparently reflects mediastinal lymphadenopathy. This is also reflected in loss of the right supraclavicular companion shadow. This is better depicted on a chest CT from ___. The pulmonary nodules seen on the CT are not readily apparent radiographically, though may be related to opacity seen at the right base laterally. 6. Status post right mastectomy with right axillary clips.
