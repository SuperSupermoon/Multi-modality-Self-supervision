Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size is enlarged. Mediastinum is stable. Upper zone re-distribution and mild interstitial engorgement are noted consistent with mild-to-moderate interstitial edema. Small amount of left pleural effusion and potentially right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
