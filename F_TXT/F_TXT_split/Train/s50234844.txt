The heart is normal in size. The aortic arch is partly calcified. There is slight unfolding of the thoracic aorta. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear otherwise unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Lung markings are attenuated at the apices, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The lungs appear clear however.
