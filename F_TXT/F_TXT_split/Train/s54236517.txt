Single AP portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval endotracheal tube placement which projects approximately 5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing past the diaphragm. No consolidation or pleural effusion is identified. There is apparent crowding of the vascular structures bilaterally which is likely explained by the reduced lung volumes.
