The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Previous pattern of mild pulmonary edema has improved. Persistent small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is re- demonstrated. A trace right pleural effusion may be present. There is no pneumothorax. Amorphous calcifications are noted adjacent to the lateral aspect of the right humeral head suggestive of calcific tendinopathy.
