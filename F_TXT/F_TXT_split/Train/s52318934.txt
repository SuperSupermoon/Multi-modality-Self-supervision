As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. As a result, areas of atelectasis have appeared at both the left and the right lung bases. Resolution of these opacities must be radiographically monitored, to exclude bilateral basal pneumonia. The right Port-A-Cath and the nasogastric tube as well as the left pectoral pacemaker are in constant position. No overt pulmonary edema. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
