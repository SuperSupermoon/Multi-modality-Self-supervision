CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 22:15 p.m., new curled tubing is present at the right lung base. Equivocal tiny right apical pneumothorax, possibly marginally improved compared with the earlier film. Small right effusion/hemothorax is unchanged. Low inspiratory volumes and bibasilar patchy opacities are unchanged. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle again noted. Doubt overt CHF.
