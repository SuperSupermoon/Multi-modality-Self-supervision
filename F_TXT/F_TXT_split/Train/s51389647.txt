Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube, its tip appears to project into the right mainstem bronchus. An enteric tube descends these thorax an uncomplicated course, its tip below the left hemidiaphragm. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.

No focal opacity convincing for pneumonia is seen. There is no air under the right hemidiaphragm. There is no pneumothorax.
