Comparison is made to prior study from ___. The heart size is enlarged. There is tortuosity and calcification of thoracic aorta. There is an endotracheal tube and feeding tube, which are unchanged in position. There are again seen bilateral pleural effusions. There is no overt pulmonary edema. There is a left-sided central venous line whose distal tip is perpendicular to the SVC junction with wall at its distal aspect. Overall, allowing for differences in patient positioning, there is no interval change.
