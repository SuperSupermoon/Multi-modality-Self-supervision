AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study with patient in semi-erect position obtained on the preceding day. The patient remains on respirator, the tracheal cannula in unchanged position. Heart size is unchanged. Right-sided chest tube also in unchanged position terminating in right apical area. Both lungs remain now aerated with no evidence of significant pneumothorax remaining. Multiple displaced rib fractures (at least six on right side) as well as left-sided rib fractures mostly in lower chest wall appear grossly unchanged. No evidence of new densities that would indicate hemorrhage into mediastinum or pleural space.
