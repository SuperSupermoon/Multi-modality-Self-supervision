AP chest compared to ___, 10:20 p.m.: ET tube ends at the thoracic inlet above the tracheal Y stent, no less than 6.4 cm from the carina. Chin is partially flexed, and the tube will back out when the head and neck are in neutral position, so position is somewhat precarious. Relative positioning of the ET tube and tracheal Y stent should be reconsidered. Left juxtahilar cavitated mass and right paratracheal adenopathy have been investigated by CT scanning. Lungs are essentially clear in other respects, and there is no pleural effusion.
