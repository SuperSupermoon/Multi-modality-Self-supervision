A right parasternal Port-A-Cath is again noted with its catheter extending into the right subclavian vein and its tip in the region of the mid to low SVC. There is new airspace consolidation in the right lower lung which is concerning for pneumonia. Also noted, is increased opacity in the right upper lobe which could represent pneumonia. Extensive pulmonary nodules as seen on prior CT again noted consistent with endometrial cancer metastasis. There is likely a small right pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable. No pneumothorax. Bony structures are intact. Bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy catheters are noted. Hardware partially noted in the lumbar spine.
