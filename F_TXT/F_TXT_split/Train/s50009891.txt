There are extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities most likely representing multifocal pneumonia. This is less likely to be florid pulmonary edema due to lack of concomitant pleural effusions or cardiomegaly. Underlying metastatic disease cannot be excluded. There is widening of the superior aspect of the mediastinum. The heart is normal in size. A left lateral lower rib appears expanded and sclerotic likely due to metastases better evaluated on prior bone scans.
