As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter with its tip terminating in the mid SVC. There is no definite pneumothorax. As before, there is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Bilateral hilar enlargement is likely due to pulmonary hypertension. The mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and probable small bilateral pleural effusion. Opacities at the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, although underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
