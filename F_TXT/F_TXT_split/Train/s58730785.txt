Pneumomediastinum and extensive subcutaneous emphysema appears unchanged. Possible small stable right pneumothorax, although this may just represent overlying subcutaneous emphysema. Status post median sternotomy with stable overall cardiac and mediastinal contours. A right internal jugular Port-A-Cath remains unchanged in position. Bibasilar opacities are again seen suggestive of atelectasis, although the appearance is slightly more consolidative at the left base raising concern for developing pneumonia. No pulmonary edema.
