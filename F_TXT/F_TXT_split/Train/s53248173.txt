In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is little change in the degree of right pneumothorax. Thoracentesis has apparently decreased the amount of pleural fluid in the right hemithorax, though there now appears to be a small loculated area of pneumothorax in the in for pulmonary region. Left lung is unchanged.
