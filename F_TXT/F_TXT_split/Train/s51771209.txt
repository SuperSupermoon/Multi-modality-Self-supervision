There is worsening airspace consolidation the left mid to lower lung which would be concerning for pneumonia. There is slightly improved aeration at the right base, although there is still residual patchy opacity in this vicinity as well. In addition, there are subtle opacities now appreciated in both upper lobes which would be concerning for pneumonia or aspiration. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. The nasogastric tube has its tip below the diaphragm but the side-port now appears to be in the distal esophagus. This tube should be advanced 7-8 cm to place both the tip and side port within the stomach.
