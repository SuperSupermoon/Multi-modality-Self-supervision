Left PICC tip is in thelower SVC, unchanged. Cardiac size is normal. Right basal chest tube is in unchanged position. There is no evident pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacities have increased consistent with increasing small effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Widening mediastinum due to lymphadenopathy, loculated right effusion, right hilar lymphadenopathy and mass in the right upper lobe are better seen in prior CT.
