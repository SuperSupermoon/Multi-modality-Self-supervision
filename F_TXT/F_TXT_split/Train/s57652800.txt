Single supine AP portable chest radiograph obtained. The tip of the endotracheal tube resides approximately 5 cm above the carina. The NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen, tip excluded from view. The lungs are clear bilaterally. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contour is widened likely secondary to an unfolded thoracic aorta. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
