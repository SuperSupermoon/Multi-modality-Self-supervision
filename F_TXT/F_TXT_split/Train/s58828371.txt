Rotated positioning. The patient has a large hiatal hernia and paraesophageal hernia containing stomach, colon, and peritoneal fat. This likely accounts for the opacity seen in the right mid and lower zones. The right paratracheal opacity is likely accounted for by a large right thyroid nodule. Allowing for these opacities on the right, no definite superimposed infiltrate is identified. Possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle. No focal infiltrate or effusion detected in the left lung. There is probable background hyperinflation/COPD. There is cardiomegaly. There is upper zone redistribution and very mild vascular plethora which could either relate to COPD for represent early CHF.
