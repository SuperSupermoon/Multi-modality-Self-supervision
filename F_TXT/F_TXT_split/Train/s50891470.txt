Cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged. Aorta is diffusely tortuous and potentially mildly dilated in the ascending region, difficult to assess on this portable semi-upright study. Pulmonary vascular engorgement is accompanied by interstitial edema and asymmetrical perihilar haziness on the right. The latter likely represents asymmetric edema but coexisting infection is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Patchy opacities are present at both lung bases, and there is also a small right pleural effusion present but no visible pneumothorax. Followup radiographs after diuresis would be helpful to confirm resolution of the interstitial abnormalities and to exclude the possibility of a more chronic interstitial process.
