Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates endotracheal tube terminating 7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is positioned in the stomach. Right internal jugular central venous catheter projects over proximal SVC. Swan-Ganz catheter is in unchanged position. Left internal jugular central venous catheter is at the cavoatrial junction. No appreciable pneumothorax. Low lung volumes accentuate bronchovascular markings. Left lung base consolidation persists, likely atelectasis. Trace left pleural effusion is likely. There is no right pleural effusion. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Increased opacification of the left hemithorax may reflect mild asymmetric pulmonary edema or pleural fluid.
