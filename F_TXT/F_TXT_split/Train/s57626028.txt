An endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm from the carina. Eneteric catheter tip terminates at the pylorus. A left subclavian line is seen in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. There has been interval decrease of the lung volumes. Left lower lobe opacification is unchanged from prior examination and could either represent pneumonia or atelectasis. The right lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is mild cardiomegaly, exaggerated by low lung volumes and by vascular engorgement. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
