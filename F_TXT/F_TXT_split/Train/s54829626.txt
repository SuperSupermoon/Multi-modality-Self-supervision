Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The aorta is diffusely calcified and mildly tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable without evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. 10 mm nodular opacity is seen projecting over the right upper lobe not clearly seen on the previous exam. Lung volumes are low with mild bibasilar atelectasis, but no focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly evident. Dextroscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine with associated degenerative changes are noted. Spiral tacks are seen in the left abdomen.
