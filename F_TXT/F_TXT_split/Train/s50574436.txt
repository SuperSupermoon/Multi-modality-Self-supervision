1. The lungs are somewhat hyperinflated with relative paucity of vasculature in the upper lobes suggestive of bullous emphysematous changes. There is crowding of the vasculature in both lower lobes. A more focal patchy opacity at the left base likely represents superimposed vessels and costochondral calcifications rather than early airspace consolidation. However, if the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging would be advised. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. No pneumothorax.
