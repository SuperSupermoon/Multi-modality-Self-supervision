There has been interval placement of a left IJ central venous catheter which terminates in the superior cavoatrial junction. The pre-existing right IJ terminates in the right atrium. The ET tube is correctly positioned 4.7 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is partially visualized with the tip coursing out of the field of view of this exam. There has been interval improvement in the atelectasis at the left lung base as well as bilateral perihilar opacities which probably reflects a combination of pulmonary edema and resolving atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Included upper abdomen is unremarkable.
