A left pectoral pacemaker with two leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle is unchanged. The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple mediastinal surgical clips and wires appearing intact. Biapical pleural thickening is unchanged. A tiny nodule projecting at the left cardiophrenic angle may represent a vessel or a calcified granuloma. The lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No pulmonary vascular congestion or edema is present. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and calcified aortic knob.
