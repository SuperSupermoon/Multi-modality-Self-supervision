Interval widening of cardiac and mediastinal contours, accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion suggesting increased volume status of the patient. Asymmetrical perihilar haziness involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left likely represents asymmetric edema within this context, but short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude aspiration or infectious pneumonia as alternative causes for the right lung opacification. Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions are present, with interval slight increase on the right.
