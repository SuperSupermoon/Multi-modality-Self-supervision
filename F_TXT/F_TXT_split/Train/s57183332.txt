The lung volumes are low, resulting in vascular crowding. Despite this there is vascular congestion and probable, small bilateral pleural effusions. Retrocardiac opacity is likely due to compressive atelectasis. The heart size is large. No pneumothorax is seen. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing through the esophagus and terminating off the image. Previously noted left rib fracture is not well visualized on the current exam.
