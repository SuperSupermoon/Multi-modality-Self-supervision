There is a new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating in the upper superior vena cava. The patient is status post sternotomy and apparently coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The heart is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is no evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Indistinct pulmonary vessels and mildly prominent interstitial markings suggest mild vascular congestion.
