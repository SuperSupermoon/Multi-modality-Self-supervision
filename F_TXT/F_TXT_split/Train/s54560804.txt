Lobulated contour to the right medial hemidiaphragm most likely represents eventration when compared to the prior study, although diaphragmatic hernia could also have this appearance. There is likely a small hiatal hernia. Lungs are well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Right paratracheal nodular opacity likely represents a dilated vein related to a fluid replete state. No pleural effusions, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Heart is upper limits of normal in size.
