There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular line with tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction. ETT is in unchanged position, 1.5 cm from the carina. There is no pneumothorax. Pulmonary edema seems slightly worsened. Otherwise no significant interval change from the prior study.
