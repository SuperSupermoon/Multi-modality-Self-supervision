1. Interval removal of two left-sided pigtail pleural catheters with interval appearance of a tiny left apical pneumothorax. This can be further evaluated on followup imaging.

Bilateral layering effusions with associated patchy right basilar airspace disease, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Results were communicated to the patient's nurse,___ ___, by phone on ___ at 4:15 p.m. at the time of discovery.
