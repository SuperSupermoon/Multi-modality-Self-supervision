Comparison is made with prior study ___. Small left effusion has decreased. Left apical opacity has minimally increased; this could be due to a loculated effusion or hematoma. There are low lung volumes. Cardiac size is top normal. Widened mediastinum is stable. Right perihilar opacities have increased likely atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded . Small right effusion is stable. Right subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC. Left chest tube remains in place. Retrocardiac opacity is consistent with persistent collapse of the left lower lobe.
