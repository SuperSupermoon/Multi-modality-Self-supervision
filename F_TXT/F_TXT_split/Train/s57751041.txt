Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC. Side port of the NG tube is in the stomach. The tip of the NG tube is near the pylorus. The tip of the partially imaged abdominal drain is in similar position compared to prior. Lung volumes are again low. There is streaky left basilar atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to prior. There appears to be a small amount of air under the right hemidiaphragm, likely due to presence of the intra-abdominal drain.
