The Dobbhoff tube extends beneath the inferior edge of this film. I suspect it loops below the edge of the film and that the radio-opaque tip then courses superiorly back into the field of view. If the radiopaque segment seen on this exam is the Dobbhoff, then it probably lies in the stomach and has not passed beyond the pylorus. The lower right chest is excluded from the film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged compared with ___ at 4:53 a.m. Bibasilar atelectasis is again noted. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle is now seen and could reflect a small effusion.
