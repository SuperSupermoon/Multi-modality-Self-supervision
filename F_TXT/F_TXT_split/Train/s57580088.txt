There has been interval placement of a lower right chest pigtail catheter with evidence of some decrease in the right pleural effusion. Small right and moderate left bilateral pleural effusions persist. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Nodular opacity projects over the lateral left mid lung could relate to a pleural effusion and atelectasis although is not well characterized on this study. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No definite pneumothorax is demonstrated.
