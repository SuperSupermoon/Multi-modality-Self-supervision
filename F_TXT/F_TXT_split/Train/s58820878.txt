ET tube tip approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. NG tube tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Left IJ central line tip at SVC /innominate junction. Tubing overlies the upper left chest immediately inside the chest wall --___ this represents a PICC line it has not reached the central venous vasculature. No pneumothorax detected . Background hyperinflation is consistent with COPD. Cardiomediastinal grossly unchanged. Compared with ___, there is increased opacity at the left lung base with new obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small effusion. Better seen on the prior film, the the patient has a rib fracture in this area. There is some patchy opacity in the left suprahilar region, which is unchanged. (This was described as a chronic fibrotic lesion in the left lobe ani prior report possibly post radiation.). Mild vascular plethora, without overt CHF. Atelectasis the right lung base. There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
