There is an ET tube which terminates approximately ___-mm above the carina, with the cuff appearing to be overinflated again. Enteric, mediastinal and left chest tubes appear to be in appropriate position. There is a normal post operative appearance of the cardiomediastinal contour, with stable mild cardiomegaly. No large pleural effusions are seen. The small right apical and minimal left basilar pneumothoraces are stable compared to the prior exam.
