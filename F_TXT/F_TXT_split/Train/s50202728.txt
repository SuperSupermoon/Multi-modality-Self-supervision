Interval removal of the right internal jugular central line, chest tube, mediastinal drains, nasogastric tube, and endotracheal tube. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable postoperative appearance to the cardiac and mediastinal contours. Lung volumes are low with patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. Probable small layering effusions, left greater than right. Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with resolving mild interstitial edema. No obvious pneumothorax.
