Overall similar appearance to the right loculated pleural effusion, though there does appear to been some increase in the degree of opacity at the right lung base. The differential includes increased collapse and/or consolidation or increased opacity due to slight increase in pleural fluid. Attention to this area on followup studies is recommended. Considerable interval improvement in left base opacity, with minimal residual patchy opacity now seen there.
