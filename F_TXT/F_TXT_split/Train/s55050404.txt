AP radiograph of the chest, obtained on ___ was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right internal jugular line has been removed. The left PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum appear grossly unchanged, but there is interval progression of pulmonary edema, left perihilar opacity, and right lower lobe opacities, that might be concerning for interval development of aspiration and/or atelectasis. Progression of pulmonary edema would be another possibility. Of note is that there is right upper mediastinal widening, better appreciated on the current study than on the prior examination. It most likely reflects widening of the mediastinal vessels; attention to this area should be paid on the subsequent studies to exclude expanding mediastinal hematoma.
