A right PICC terminating in the low SVC and an ICD/pacemaker are unchanged. There is no change in the right perihilar opacity, which based on the subsequent CT, is consistent with edema. The other areas of moderate pulmonary edema have slightly improved. There is no new opacity. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac size remains moderately enlarged. The mediastinal contours are normal.
