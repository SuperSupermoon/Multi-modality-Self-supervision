As compared to the previous image, there is a substantial progression. 1. A pre-existing and previously subtle parenchymal opacity in the right upper lobe has substantially increased in extent and severity. Air bronchograms are now seen and there is beginning volume loss of the right upper lobe. 2. The left lung now shows a left lower lobe atelectasis and evidence of moderate perihilar haze, likely reflecting moderate pulmonary edema. 3. No pleural effusions. The monitoring and support devices are constant. Interposition of the colon between the liver and the hemidiaphragm.
