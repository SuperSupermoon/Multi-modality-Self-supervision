Compared to the most recent comparison, there is an increase in perihilar opacities and interstitial lung markings consistent with mild pulmonary edema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions and considerable bilateral lower lobe and left mid lung atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The appearance of the mediastinum and heart are unchanged. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower SVC. The previously seen malpositioned left PICC has been removed.
