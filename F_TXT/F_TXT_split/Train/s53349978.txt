The lungs are hyperinflated. Increased interstitial opacities at the lung bases bilaterally in the presence of mild cardiomegaly likely represent pulmonary edema.

Soft tissue densities in the axilla bilaterally may represent adenopathy, however are not unusually appreciated by plain film. Correlation with physical exam is recommended.
