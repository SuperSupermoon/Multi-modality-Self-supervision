As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The bilateral pleural effusions are constant in extent and severity. Also constant are the subsequent areas of atelectasis at the lung bases and a moderate cardiomegaly. The right predominant parenchymal opacities, likely caused by the small right lung volume and there potential infection, have not substantially increased in extent since the previous examination. No new parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
