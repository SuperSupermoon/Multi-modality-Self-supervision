Comparison is made with prior study performed 6 hours earlier. NG tube has been advanced, now the tip is in the stomach. ET tube has been repositioned, now the tip is 3.2 cm above the carina. Of note, the NG tube is coiled in the hypopharynx. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has worsened. Right lower lobe opacity is unchanged. Right upper lobe opacity is stable. Opacities are a combination of areas of atelectases and aspiration. There is no evident pneumothorax. Left PICC tip is in the lower SVC.
