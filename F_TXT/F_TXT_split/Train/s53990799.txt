Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules suggestive of pulmonary metastases. Elevated right hemidiaphragm, but it has maintained its normal contour (also seen on previous imaging). The cardiomediastinal shadow is normal. No pneumothorax. Right-sided subclavian Port-A-Cath in situ with the tip in the mid to distal SVC. No new airspace consolidation. No pleural effusions.
