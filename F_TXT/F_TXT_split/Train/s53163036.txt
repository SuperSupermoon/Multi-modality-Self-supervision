AP chest compared to ___: I see no focal consolidation, though the lower lungs are partially obscured by the heart, descending aorta and hemidiaphragms respectively. The upper lungs are entirely clear. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Thoracic aorta is generally large, and comparable in caliber and course to the appearance on some, but not all prior chest radiographs. It would be extremely difficult to detect change in or recurrence of aortic dissection on conventional radiographs alone. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
