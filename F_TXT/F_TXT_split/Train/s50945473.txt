Supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There is interval placement of an endotracheal tube terminating just above the level of the clavicles. The exact level of the carina is difficult to determine due to patient's overlying sternotomy hardware. An orogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the images. Left subclavian central venous catheter terminates at the distal SVC/cavoatrial junction. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion appears improved. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis.
