Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is a right-sided PICC line, right IJ Cordis, endotracheal tube, feeding tube, which are all unchanged in position. The tip of the endotracheal tube is slightly low and is 3 cm above the carina. This could be pulled back 1 cm for more optimal placement. There are bilateral pleural effusions, left side greater than right. There is mild pulmonary interstitial edema. Persistent bibasilar atelectasis is seen.
