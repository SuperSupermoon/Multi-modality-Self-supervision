The lungs are hyperexpanded, findings consistent with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, there is increased consolidation within the right lung base which correlates with opacities on concurrent chest CT concerning for pneumonia. Linear opacities in the left lung base are also increased and may represent infection or possibly subsegmental atelectasis. Mild mediastinal widening corresponds with adenopathy seen on concurrent chest CT. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild generalized vascular engorgement is present, though the heart size is normal.
