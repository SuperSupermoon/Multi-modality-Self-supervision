The frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. Linear markings seen previously are no longer visualized, and likely represented overlying hair or fabric rather than pneumomediastinum. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
