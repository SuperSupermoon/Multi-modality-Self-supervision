The lungs are hyperinflated with severe emphysematous changes again noted. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with a small hiatal hernia again noted. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Increased interstitial markings in the lung bases appear slightly increased compared to the prior chest radiograph, particularly in the right lung base, with associated bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening compatible with an airways inflammatory or infectious process. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is demonstrated. No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
