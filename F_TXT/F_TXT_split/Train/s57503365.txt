Streaky left basilar opacity has resolved, and a PICC line has been removed. On this study, there is upper zone redistribution of indistinct pulmonary vascularity as well as a mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality. Overall, findings are most suggestive of pulmonary edema. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
