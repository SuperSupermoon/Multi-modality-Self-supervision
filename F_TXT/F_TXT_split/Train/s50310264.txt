Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to pre-operative study from ___. Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax within the limitations of this study technique. Subcutaneous air is noted within the neck bilaterally and upper chest. Minimal amount of anterior mediastinal air projecting over the trachea cannot be excluded. Small amount of pneumoperitoneum is demonstrated. Lungs are clear. Left retrocardiac opacity is new, most likely reflecting atelectasis, potentially aspiration. Repeated radiograph is recommended.
