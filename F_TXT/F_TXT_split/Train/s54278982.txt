A single portable frontal supine view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post endotracheal tube placement with tip approximately 1.8 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is below the diaphragm but not fully imaged. The cardiac silhouette is likely accentuated by low lung volumes and the AP supine technique. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Linear left basilar opacity likely represents atelectasis. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
