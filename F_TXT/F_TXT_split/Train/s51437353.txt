AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting erect position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The examination interval is 14 hours. No significant interval change can be identified. The heart size may be at the upper limit of normal variation, but there is no evidence of any acute pulmonary vascular congestion or significant enlargement of the left atrium as can be identified on the single view chest examination. The lateral pleural sinuses remain free. Relatively low positioned diaphragms with somewhat flattened appearance give the impression of COPD as the patient also has some increased interstitial markings on the bases, but again acute infiltrates are not present, nor is there any evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.
