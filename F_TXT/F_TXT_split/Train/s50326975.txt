Single frontal view of the chest. Lung volumes are low. There is an increased large right pleural effusion and a new small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Background interstitial lung disease is not markedly changed. The cardiac silhouette is obscured by effusions and is difficult to assess.
