Calcified pleural plaques are again noted. Lower lung fibrosis accounts for the opacity in the lung bases bilaterally, however the retrocardiac and left lower lobe opacity has increased since prior examination worrisome for superimposed pneumonia. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is new mild widening of the mediastinum, measuring 7.7 cm, likely accentuated due to supine positioning. Heart size, and hila are grossly unremarkable. Limited assessment upper abdomen is unremarkable. Visualized osseous structures are grossly unremarkable. No displaced rib fractures.
