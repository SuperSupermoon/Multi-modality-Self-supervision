Portable AP upright view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior studies. An endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube ends in the mid portion of the stomach. Low lung volumes persist and exaggerate the mediastinal and cardiac contours that are unchanged. A retrocardiac opacity is unchanged and likely represents atelectasis or infection. There is a new small left pleural effusion. Right lower lobe atelectasis has minimally improved.
