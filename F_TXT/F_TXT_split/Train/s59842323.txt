One AP radiograph of the chest is available and no prior studies are available for comparison. The ET tube tip is relatively high, at the level of the clavicular heads approximately 6 cm above the carina. No NG tube or other supporting devices demonstrated. The mediastinum is widened, in particular the right portion of the mediastinum and should be further assessed either in comparison with prior studies or with chest CT. Cardiomegaly is suspected. Left retrocardiac consolidation is seen and although might reflect atelectasis, infectious process is likely. Calcified nodules in the left upper lobe are noted and might reflect granulomas as well as in the right lower lobe to lesser extent. Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
