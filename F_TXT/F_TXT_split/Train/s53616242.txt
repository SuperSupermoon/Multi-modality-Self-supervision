As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of a small basal right pneumothorax. The maximum of the small air collection is now located medially. There is blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, so that the presence of a minimal right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. The position of the endotracheal tube, the right chest tube and the nasogastric tube are unchanged. No evidence of tension.
