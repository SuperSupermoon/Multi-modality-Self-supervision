Prior ground-glass opacification of the lungs, predominantly dependent, continues to improve. There is no longer any vascular congestion. It is conceivable that there was aspiration to the right lower lobe earlier, but if there was pneumonia it is resolving. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal. ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric tube crural's in a nondistended stomach. The lower trachea has a narrow coronal diameter suggesting preexisting lung disease.
