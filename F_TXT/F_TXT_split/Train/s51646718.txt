Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place in the lower right hemithorax. Adjacent lucency at the level of the right hemidiaphragm favors a basilar pneumothorax over pneumoperitoneum as the visceral pleural line is now evident just below the pigtail pleural catheter site. A more confluent area of opacity persists in the right infrahilar region, and appears to correspond to a complex collection in the right lower chest better delineated on recent CTA of ___.
