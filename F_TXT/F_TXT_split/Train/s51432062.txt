Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube tip is in standard position, 2.2 cm above the carina. Right subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC. There are persistent low lung volumes. Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis in the lingula are increased from prior study chest x-ray, but similar to prior CT performed eight hours earlier. There is no pneumothorax. There is mild pulmonary edema.
