The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Subtle opacity projecting over the right lower lung may be due to atelectasis but early consolidation is not excluded. There is slight blunting of the costophrenic angles which can be seen with trace pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
