As compared to the previous examination, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed, as have the pleural and mediastinal tubes. The Swan-Ganz catheter remains in place. Alignment of the sternal wires is unchanged. There continues to be a minimal pneumopericardium. Minimal atelectasis at the left lung bases and blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially consistent with a small left pleural effusion. Multiple healed rib fractures are unchanged. No evidence of pneumothorax. Overinflation of the stomach, which might benefit from insertion of a nasogastric tube.
