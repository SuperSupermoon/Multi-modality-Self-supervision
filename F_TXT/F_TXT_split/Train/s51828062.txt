Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. The tracheostomy tip is approximately 6 cm above the carina. The right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC. The left internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Heart size is unchanged, enlarged. Mediastinum is unchanged in appearance with wide contours contributing to substantial mediastinal fat deposition. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema appears to be grossly unchanged or minimally improved since the prior study. Bilateral left more than right pleural effusions, partially loculated are unchanged.
