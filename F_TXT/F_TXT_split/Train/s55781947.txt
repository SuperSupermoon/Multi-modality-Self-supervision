Pleurex drain catheter tip projects over the left lower hemithorax. Moderate left pleural effusion persists and is probably slightly worse with increased rightward shift of the right heart border compared to the prior exam despite coexisting left atelectasis. Remaining aerated left lung is overall similar in appearance with perhaps slightly improved aeration of the left lung apex. The right lower lung is grossly clear. The heart is severely enlarged. Calcification of the aortic knob unchanged. No pneumothorax.
