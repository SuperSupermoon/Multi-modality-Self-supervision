AP chest compared to earlier examinations on ___, 6:10 a.m. through 7:17 p.m.: Presumed anterior pneumothorax in the left lower chest is smaller, while subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall remains stable. Opacification in the left lower lobe is slightly more extensive, presumably atelectasis or contusion. The volume of posteriorly collected left pleural effusion is hard to assess. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal aside from mild rightward shift due to left pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube ends in the distal stomach. ET tube and right jugular line are in standard positions respectively, and the right lung is clear.
