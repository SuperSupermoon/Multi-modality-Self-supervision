As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Moderate cardiomegaly, left retrocardiac atelectasis. No overt pulmonary edema. The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded, given the blunting of the left costophrenic sinus. No evidence of pneumonia, no interval appearance of new parenchymal changes. The right PICC line and the nasogastric tube are constant in position.
