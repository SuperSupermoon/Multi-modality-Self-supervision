Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest provided. The pacemaker is again seen projecting over the left chest wall with leads extending to the region of the right atrium and right ventricle. Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again seen. The heart remains top normal in size. The lung volumes are quite low, which limits the evaluation primarily through the lower lungs. Allowing for this, there is no definite sign of pulmonary edema or pneumonia. No effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The bony structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
