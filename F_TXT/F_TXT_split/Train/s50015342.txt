The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, with the exception of a slight deviation of the tube at the level of the lower esophageal third, suggesting the potential presence of a hiatal hernia. The site of the tube is located at the gastroesophageal junction, the tip of the tube projects over the proximal parts of the stomach. The tube should be advanced by approximately 5 cm. There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. Mild retrocardiac areas of atelectasis.
