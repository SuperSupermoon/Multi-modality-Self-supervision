As compared to the previous radiograph, the known right parenchymal opacity, likely resulting from aspiration, is unchanged in location and extent. New is a minimal left basal opacity with air bronchograms of similar appearance, but lesser extent and severity. If consistent with a clinical presentation, presence of a recurrent aspiration must be suspected. No other changes. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pulmonary edema. Right PICC line in unchanged position.
