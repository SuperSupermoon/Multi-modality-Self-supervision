Left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the proximal SVC. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been removed. Lung volumes remain low with patchy opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis. There has been interval improvement in the mild pulmonary edema, but persistent crowding of the vasculature. No pneumothorax is appreciated. No large effusions are seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the marked low lung volumes. Patchy bibasilar opacity most likely still reflects patchy atelectasis, although a developing infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. Clinical correlation is advised.
