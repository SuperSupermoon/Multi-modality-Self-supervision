Left pulmonary artery is quite large, and its size and shape have fluctuated over the past 6 days. This is a finding that can be seen with acute pulmonary embolus or fluctuation in pulmonary artery pressure due to volume loading and left heart dysfunction. There was no embolus on a chest CTA performed ___ which however showed considerable mucoid impaction in both lower lobes, especially the left. That may serve to explain persistent consolidation at the medial aspect of the left lung base. Since ___ moderate left pleural effusion has increased. Heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube and left PIC line are in standard placements respectively. The only suggested complication of new tracheostomy is slight in the right paratracheal mediastinal tissues suggesting local bleeding.
