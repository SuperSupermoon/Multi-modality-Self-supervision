There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter which terminates at the cavoatrial junction/ right atrium. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The right costophrenic angle is not fully included. Patchy left basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis, infection or aspiration. Suggestion of ovoid lucency projecting over the lateral left hemidiaphragm may be artifactual due the adjacent atelectasis although superimposed bowel is not entirely excluded. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
