There is interval development of marked mediastinal widening consistent with clinical history of hematoma. Previously noted mediastinal gas is no longer seen. The cardiac silhouette remains normal in size. There is no large pleural effusion. Bilateral infrahilar opacity is new and may reflect atelectasis, or aspiration. A right hilar mass is again noted. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.
