The tip of a right pectoral MediPort projects over the lower SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral coarse reticular nodular opacities have slightly increased at the left lung base. The presence of chronic fibrotic lung disease makes it difficult to exclude small pulmonary metastases. Correlation with cross-sectional imaging if not already obtained would be helpful. A right upper quadrant stent is again noted. A radiopaque object with both rounded and triangular components projecting over the right lung base is likely external to the patient.
