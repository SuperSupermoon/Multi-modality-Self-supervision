In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there are lower lung volumes. The monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. The nasogastric tube extends to the upper to mid stomach. The area of the previous loop proximally is not included in this study. There is increased opacification at the left base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe with pleural effusion. The mediastinal silhouette is more sharply seen and less prominent than on the previous examination. If there is any ease a serious clinical concern for mediastinal bleeding, CT would be the next imaging procedure.
