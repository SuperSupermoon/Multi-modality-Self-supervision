Right lower lobe consolidation which developed after ___, is still present, but the major interval change has been an increase in moderately severe though somewhat asymmetrically distributed pulmonary edema. Mediastinal widening has progressed indicating further dilatation of mediastinal veins, due to elevated central venous pressure. Large hiatus hernia is more distended, now fluid filled and raises possibility of aspiration. Heart is normal size. Moderate right pleural effusion has increased. Left pleural effusion is small if any. No pneumothorax. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.
