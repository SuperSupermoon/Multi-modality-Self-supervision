As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right-sided chest tube. The extensive right effusion has moderately decreased but still occupies over ___% of the right hemi thorax. Subsequent areas of atelectasis and re-expansion edema are visualized. The lung volumes have overall decreased, causing mild crowding of vascular and bronchial structures at the left lung bases. No pneumothorax
