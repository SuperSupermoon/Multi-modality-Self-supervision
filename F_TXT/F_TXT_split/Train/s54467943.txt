What was severe pulmonary edema on ___ at 01:21 has improved substantially, persisting only in the lower lung zones. The chest CTA on ___ showed adenopathy in the mediastinum, but not in the bulky appearing right hilus. Its apparent enlargement is probably due to dilated crossing veins, large pulmonary arteries, an adjacent atelectasis, also a feature in the left lower lobe. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. Heart size is mildly enlarged but stable.
