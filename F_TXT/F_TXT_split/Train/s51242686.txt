In comparison with the earlier study, the right perihilar tumor is again seen with some heterogeneous opacification at the right base, which could represent aspiration. No definite evidence of pneumothorax. There is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels. It is unclear whether this could reflect some increase in pulmonary venous pressure or possibly a more supine position of the patient.
