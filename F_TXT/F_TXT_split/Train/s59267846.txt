Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. Two left chest tubes remain in place. A dual lumen endotracheal tube is unchanged in position. A right internal jugular introducing catheter remains in place with its tip in the proximal SVC. There continues to be a widened mediastinal contour with opacity in the left upper chest in this patient status post a ruptured aorta with dissection. Overall, the right lung remains grossly clear and the lower left lung has some interval improvement in aeration. No large pneumothorax is appreciated. There is some air within the left lateral chest wall soft tissues consistent with subcutaneous emphysema in this recently postoperative patient.
