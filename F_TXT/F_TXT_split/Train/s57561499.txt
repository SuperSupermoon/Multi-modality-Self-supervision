Interval appearance of pulmonary mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. More focal patchy opacity at both bases may reflect compressive atelectasis especially as there are small layering pleural effusions, left greater than right. Bibasilar pneumonia cannot be excluded and therefore followup imaging should be considered based on the clinical assessment. No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Calcific density overlying the body of the left scapula consistent with known sub scapularis calcific tendinitis.
