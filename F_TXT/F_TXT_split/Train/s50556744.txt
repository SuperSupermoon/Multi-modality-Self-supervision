The lungs are hyperinflated and demonstrate diffuse bronchiectasis and peribronchial wall thickening, findings consistent with COPD. A left basilar opacity is of uncertain etiology. Though atelectasis and pneumonia should be considered, scarring is also a possibility given the adjacent tenting of the left hemidiaphragm. No pneumothorax is evident. There is no pulmonary edema. there is a possible small left pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
