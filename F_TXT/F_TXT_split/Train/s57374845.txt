Comparison is made to same-day chest x-ray with interval placement of ET tube terminating 0.5 cm superior to the carina. Previously seen lower left lobe opacity is improved and likely represents small left pleural effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis. Again the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is no evidence of focal opacities, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.
