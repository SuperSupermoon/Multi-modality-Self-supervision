Endotracheal tube tip is 5.5 cm from the carina. Enteric tube is seen to the level of the lower mediastinum although is not clearly seen to pass below the diaphragm and should be advanced. Bibasilar streaky opacities, left greater than right are noted, potentially atelectasis although infection is not excluded. Right humeral head hardware is identified as well as degenerative changes at the shoulders bilaterally.
