The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent prior chest radiographs. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, similar to prior CT. There is associated right basilar atelectasis. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. A right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen with the tip terminating in the proximal right atrium. The cardiomediastinal contours are exaggerated due to low lung volumes. Within this limitation, there is no significant change from the prior study allowing for low lung volumes.
