As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left pectoral pacemaker. The course of the pacemaker leads is unremarkable, the generator is implanted in the left pectoral region. One of the leads projects over the right atrium, the other one over the right ventricle. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. A minimal rounded opacity projecting over the right lung apex, between the posterior aspects of the second and the third rib, is seen in unchanged manner and has not increased in shape or size as compared to the previous radiograph.
