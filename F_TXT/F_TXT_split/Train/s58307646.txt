Single upright portable view of the chest demonstrates a dual-lead pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle and a left-sided port with tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction, both inferiorly displaced by a left neck mass, possibly a goiter. The lung volumes are low, and there is perihilar haziness and thickening along the minor fissure, consistent with pulmonary edema due to heart failure. An underlying infectious process cannot be completely excluded, particularly given the appearance of a ringed opacity in the right lower lobe, which could represent a cavitary lesion. The heart is enlarged. No pneumothorax is present.
