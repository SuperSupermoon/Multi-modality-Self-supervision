Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates hyperexpanded lungs. There are stable widespread airspace opacities, which are not significantly changed from the prior study, and likely represent pneumonia and/or hemorrhage. There is a superimposed wedge-shaped consolidation in the left upper lung which is on a background of interstitial lung disease. Dense retrocardiac opacity is new over the interval, and may represent atelectasis or pheumonia, and/or hemorrhage. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. The endotracheal tube ends 6.2 cm from the carina. Right-sided internal jugular central venous line dense at the proximal SVC. There is no pneumothorax. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion.
