AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The left subclavian line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. Right basal opacity is noted, might represent atelectasis or pneumonia. Aspiration would be another possibility. Continued surveillance of the subsequent studies is recommended. Left basal linear opacity, most likely represent atelectasis.
