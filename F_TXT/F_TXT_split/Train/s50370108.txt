There has been worsening of the areas of consolidation and interstitial prominence throughout both lung fields. There are more confluent areas of consolidation in the perihilar regions and in the left base. No pneumothoraces are identified. Findings may relate to multifocal pneumonia as previously suspected; however superimposed pulmonary edema could also be present.
