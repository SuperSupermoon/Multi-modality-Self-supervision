Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position, terminating 5.8 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach but the side port is in the distal esophagus, and should be advanced. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis though aspiration is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Left internal jugular vascular sheath terminates in the region of the confluence of the left subclavian vein and internal jugular vein.
