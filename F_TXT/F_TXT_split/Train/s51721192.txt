A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates the repositioned right PICC with the tip at the origin of the SVC. Per discussion with the IV nurse, the PICC was pulled back only 4 cm, but radiographically it appears to have been withdrawn 7-8 cm. The remainder of the exam is unchanged, demonstrating severe bilateral homogeneous opacities consistent with pulmonary edema.
