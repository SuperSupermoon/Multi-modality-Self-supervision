As compared to the previous radiograph, the PICC line appears to have been slightly pulled back. The tip of the line projects over the upper to mid SVC. The line however is difficult to visualize, given that it parallels the ECG leads. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. No pleural effusions. No pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly seen in unchanged manner.
