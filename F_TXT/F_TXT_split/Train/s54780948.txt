Spinal hardware remains in place. The left subclavian PICC line continues to terminate in the proximal right atrium. The right PICC line has been removed. Persistent airspace consolidation in both upper lobes, the medial right base and the left base are essentially unchanged and may reflect an infectious process although pulmonary edema should also be considered. Clinical correlation is recommended. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the diffuse airspace process.
