Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, right subclavian PICC line and left-sided pacer are all unchanged in position. There continues to be bilateral airspace opacities which are essentially stable. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged, although somewhat difficult to assess to the diffuse airspace process. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
