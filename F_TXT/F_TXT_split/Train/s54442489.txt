The orogastric tube is partially coiled in the cervical esophagus; however, the rest of its course can be traced below the diaphragm into the body of the stomach, but its tip is beyond the radiographic view. Endotracheal tube ends 7 cm above the carina at the level of the clavicles. Consider advancing the ET tube by 2 cm for better seating. Subclavian line through the right side ends at the lower SVC. Bilateral lungs are remarkable for opacities in the lower medial lungs, likely from aspiration. Upper lungs are clear. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
