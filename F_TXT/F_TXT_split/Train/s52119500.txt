1. Interval removal of the right internal jugular central line. Lung volumes remain markedly low and there is persistent stable left pleural effusion with associated airspace opacity, most likely reflecting atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Patchy opacities within the right lung are concerning for aspiration pneumonia. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the marked low lung volumes. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema.
