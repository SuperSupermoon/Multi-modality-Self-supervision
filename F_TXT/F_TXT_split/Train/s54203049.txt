In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with low lung volumes. No evidence of increase in pulmonary venous pressure. Continued bibasilar opacifications, now with poor definition of the right hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusions and volume loss in the lower lobes, especially on the left. Streaks of atelectatic change are seen in the left mid-zone.
