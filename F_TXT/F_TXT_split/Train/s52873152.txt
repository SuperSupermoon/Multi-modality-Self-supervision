There is a new endotracheal tube, which terminates approximately 1.2 cm above the carina. An NG tube is seen coursing into the stomach and off the image. Bilateral pleural effusions are now evident. The parenchymal opacity at the level of the left upper lobe has improved since the prior study, perhaps reflecting improved aeration secondary to the intubation. There is interval increased right basilar opacity, possibly relating to pleural effusion. Heart size remains top normal. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is possibly due to combination of edema as well as low lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax.
