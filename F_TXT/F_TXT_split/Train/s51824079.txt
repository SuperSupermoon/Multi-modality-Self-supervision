No prior studies for comparison. The heart is enlarged. There is a right-sided dialysis catheter with distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. The mediastinum is not widened. The lungs are grossly clear. No pleural effusions are seen. There is a small nodular density seen at the right lower lobe near the CP angle, which is nonspecific but continued attention to this area is recommended to establish if this is a developing infiltrate given the decreased breath sounds on the right.
