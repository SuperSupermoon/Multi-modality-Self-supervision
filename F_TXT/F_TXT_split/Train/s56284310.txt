Interval placement of a tracheostomy tube with its tip 3.1 cm above the carina. Right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position with the tip in the distal SVC. There continues to be right lung and left basilar airspace opacities which do not appear to be significantly changed since ___ and may reflect areas of pneumonia or aspiration. Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pneumothorax. No large effusions are seen. Interval removal of the nasogastric tube. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning and technique.
