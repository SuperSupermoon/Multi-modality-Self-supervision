There has been interval increase in a small left apical pneumothorax. The lungs are fully expanded and clear. All the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The remaining pleural surfaces are normal. There are unchanged mildly angulated, minimally displaced fractures of the left anterolateral sixth, seventh, and likely eighth ribs. Note, radiograph is not sensitive for the detection of subtle or nondisplaced rib fractures.
