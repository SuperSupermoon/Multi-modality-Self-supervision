AP chest reviewed in conjunction with chest CT on ___: Small-to-moderate volume of right pleural fluid persists following placement of a basal pleural drain whose tip impinges on the mediastinum in the midline. There is no appreciable right pneumothorax, though there is extensive new subcutaneous emphysema in the right lower lateral chest wall and in the right neck. Right lower lung is at least atelectatic. Consolidation cannot be excluded. Left lung is clear, and the mediastinum is midline.
