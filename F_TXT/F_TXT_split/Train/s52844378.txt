Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates relative decrease in opacification of the right mid hemithorax status post bronchoscopy. There are some persistent atelectatic changes in the right mid lung field. Left lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The endotracheal tube ends 5.6 cm from the carina and should be advanced for more secure seating.
