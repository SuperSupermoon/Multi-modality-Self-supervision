Left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place in the lower left hemithorax, but a moderate-to-large partially loculated pleural effusion has increased in size since the previous study. Additionally, there is a suggestion of a tiny pneumothorax at the left lung apex. New airspace opacities are present in the left perihilar region, and could reflect reexpansion edema considering that the prior study was obtained immediately after placement of pigtail catheter with associated large reduction in volume of left pleural effusion. Persistent blunting of right lateral costophrenic sulcus consistent with small pleural effusion. Adjacent patchy opacity at right base may reflect atelectasis or early pneumonia.
