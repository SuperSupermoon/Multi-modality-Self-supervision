Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. A dual-lumen right internal jugular central line is again seen with its tip in the mid SVC. An endotracheal tube is identified with its tip approximately 7 cm above the carina. A right-sided PICC line is seen with its tip overlying the mid axilla. The heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly or a pericardial effusion. There is an increasing layering left effusion and a smaller right effusion. The pulmonary edema may have slightly improved but remains. The retrocardiac area is under penetrated and cannot be well evaluated but there is likely at least partial lower lobe atelectasis given the size of the left effusion. No large pneumothorax.
