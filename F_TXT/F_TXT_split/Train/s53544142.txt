The tracheostomy tube is unchanged in standard position, hemodialysis right jugular catheter is unchanged, with tip ending in right atrium. The diffuse non-volume-dependent pulmonary edema is unchanged. Also, minimal improvement of the right base is visible, likely for reduced pleural effusion. Heart size and mediastinal silhouettes are enlarged since yesterday. This finding should be interpreted in light of central venous pressure measurement and ventilation setting, because it might reflecting a worsening of the heart/cardiac function or an increased central venous return.
