A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval repositioning of an endotracheal tube, which now terminates 2 cm from the carina. The enteric tube is not visualized on this exam. Diffuse patchy opacities are unchanged. Increased retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
