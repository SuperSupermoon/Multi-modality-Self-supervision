1. Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet approximately 4-5 cm above the carina, which is difficult to visualize on the current study. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC and nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Increasing airspace opacity at the left base with an associated layering effusion is seen likely representing partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given patient rotation on the current examination.
