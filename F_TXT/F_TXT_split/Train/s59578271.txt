AP chest compared to ___: Appreciable left pleural abnormality persists despite the pigtail pleural drain, which may now be sharply folded at the base of the left chest. It should be evaluated clinically for functionality. A string of round opacities in the left lung parallel to the left hilus are probably foci of infection, as shown by the torso CT on ___. On the right, the dominant opacity, oval and oriented roughly parallel to the minor fissure, is a fissural fluid collection, but other areas of opacity in the right lung are also likely infectious. Mild edema in the left lung has been worse than any edema on the right since at least earlier on ___. Azygous distension suggests elevated central venous pressure. Small right pleural effusion is stable, despite the right basal pleural drain. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube and left internal jugular line are in standard placements and upper enteric tubes pass into the stomach and out of view. There is no pneumothorax.
