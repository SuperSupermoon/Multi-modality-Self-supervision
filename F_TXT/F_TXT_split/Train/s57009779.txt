There is mild cardiomegaly, increased compared to the prior exam. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The lungs are well-expanded. Diffusely increased interstitial markings with prominence is consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. ___ B-lines are also seen bilaterally. Additionally, there is increased asymmetric prominence at the right lung apex, which may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or developing infectious process. The upper abdomen is unremarkable. A left axillary dual lead pacemaker defibrillator is seen with tips in the right atrium and right ventricle as expected.
