CHEST (1 PORTABLE AP) An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 4.7 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film. Right IJ central line tip overlies the proximal/mid SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. There is increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. A small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. No CHF, right-sided infiltrate, or right effusion is identified. Compared with ___ at 15:01 pm, there has been considerable interval improvement in the degree of aeration in the left upper and mid zones, with essentially complete resolution of the previously seen opacity there. The mediastinum now appears midline.
