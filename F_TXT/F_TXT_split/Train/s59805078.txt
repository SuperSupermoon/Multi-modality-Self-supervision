A right IJ line is present. The tip now overlies the mid/ distal SVC, retracted compared with the most recent prior study. No pneumothorax is detected. Widening of the superior mediastinal silhouette is noted, but in keeping with findings on multiple prior studies. CHF findings and bibasilar atelectasis have improved somewhat compared with the prior film. Increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, remains present. Small left-greater-than-right pleural effusions may be present.
