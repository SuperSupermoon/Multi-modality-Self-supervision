As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has been removed. The lung volumes have substantially decreased, likely reflecting decreased inspiration. There is a new zone of increased radiodensity in the retrocardiac lung regions on the left. The most likely explanation for this change is atelectasis but developing pneumonia cannot be completely excluded. Short-term repeat radiographic followup is recommended.
