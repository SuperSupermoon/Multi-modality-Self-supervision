The tip of the right PICC line projects over the right axillary region. The tip of the feeding tube projects over the proximal stomach. Low lung volume on the right with a new right apical opacity which may reflect atelectasis with volume loss. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. The size of the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but unchanged.
