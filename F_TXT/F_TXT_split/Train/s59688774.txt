A left-sided chest tube is in place. There is a small- to moderate-sized pneumothorax, seen at the apex of the lung and extending along the medial upper surface of the lung, with small amount of atelectasis at the left base. The mediastinum remains midline. There is slight upper zone redistribution and mild prominence of basilar markings, but I doubt overt CHF. No frank consolidation or gross effusion. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be present. Suspect background COPD. There is mild right convex curvature of the thoracic spine on this semi-upright view. Note is made of the fusion construct in the lower thoracic/upper lumbar spine, nominal alignment on these films. Allowing for the gastric air bubble, no free air seen beneath the diaphragm.
