AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The left ventricular pacing lead was placed as well as additional right ventricular pacemaker defibrillator lead. Two abandoned leads are noted adjacent to the pacemaker, better appreciated than on the prior study, potentially new. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. There is no pneumothorax. Interstitial lung disease predominantly affecting lung bases in the peripheral distribution appears to be unchanged with no appreciable pleural effusion seen.
