1. Lung volumes remain low with suggestion of volume loss in both lower lobes most consistent with atelectasis. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests the presence of a small effusion or pleural thickening. Scattered calcified nodules in both lungs are unchanged since ___ and are therefore consistent with calcified granulomas. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
