There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Right sided opacities have slightly decreased, however the left-sided pleural effusion has slightly increased since 8 AM of the same day and since the ___ exam. Additional streaky opacities at bilateral lung bases are consistent with atelectasis. A PICC terminates in the mid to low SVC.
