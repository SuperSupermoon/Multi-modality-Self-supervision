Endotracheal tube with its tip at the thoracic inlet. Right internal jugular central line with its tip in the distal SVC. Left internal jugular catheter has its tip in the distal SVC at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged. Nasogastric tube remains in place with its tip below the diaphragm and the side port near the gastroesophageal junction. There continues to be bilateral airspace process which is now worse on the right than the left, although is slightly less nodular in appearance. These findings could represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, although an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded, and therefore, clinical correlation is advised. Linear opacity at the left base most likely represents subsegmental atelectasis. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning. No pneumothorax is appreciated. No large layering effusions.
