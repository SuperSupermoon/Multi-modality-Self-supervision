ET tube terminates 4.1 cm from the Carina. The cuff is slightly hyper inflated. Right IJ terminates in the upper right atrium. Enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm and beyond the field of view. Lung volumes are very low. There is worsening atelectasis at the right base. Worsening opacity at the left base likely reflects layering pleural effusion.
