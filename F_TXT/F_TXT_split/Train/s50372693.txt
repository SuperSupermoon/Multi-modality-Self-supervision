AP chest compared to ___: Slight left apical pigtail pleural drainage catheter, there is probably still a small component of anterior pneumothorax projecting over the left hemidiaphragm laterally. Heart size is unchanged, but there is slight increase in caliber of mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature, suggesting slight decrease in cardiac function or mild volume overload. Asymmetric edema is mild, favoring the left lung. Small right pleural effusion or pleural thickening persists. Basal pleural drains still in place. ET tube in standard placement. No right pneumothorax. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach but would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the sideports beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
