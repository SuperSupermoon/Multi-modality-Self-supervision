In comparison to chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval removal right-sided PICC line. More conspicuous in comparison to prior radiograph is hazy airspace opacity occupying much of the lower right lobe. This likely reflect a combination of layering pleural fluid, atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded. Left lower lung subtle airspace opacification may represent crowding of bronchovascular structures and basilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax. There is no evidence of left pleural effusion.
