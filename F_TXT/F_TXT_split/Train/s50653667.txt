Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is present. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is normal. Round opacity projecting over the hilar and cardiac silhouette is no longer visualized compatible with patient's history of cyst resection. No pneumothorax. Right-sided chest tube is in place. Partial imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
