The tip of the right-sided Port-A-Cath is ill-defined but likely ends in the distal SVC, unchanged. Interval decreased aeration of the lungs with persistent low lung volumes. Post left upper lobectomy changes in the left upper hemithorax are expected and unchanged. Aeration of the remaining left lung is reduced. Asymmetric opacification of the lower lung may reflect a combination of atelectasis or small left pleural effusion, or may be projectional. Heart size cannot be adequately assessed as the borders are not well-defined on the left, although is probably a normal, similar to the prior exam. No overt pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
