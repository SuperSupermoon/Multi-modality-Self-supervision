Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours unremarkable. Again seen is a right lower lobe mass with increased opacification at the right lung base with a small right pleural effusion, which are expected changes post-bronchoscopy. There is no left pleural effusion. Emphysematous changes at the lung apices limits assessment, but no pneumothorax is seen.
