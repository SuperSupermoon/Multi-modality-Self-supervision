As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged persisting left tiny apical and basal pneumothorax. The right apex is difficult to evaluate due to overlying wires, however, there also is likely presence of a minimal right apical pneumothorax. No evidence of tension. The position of the chest tubes and other monitoring and support devices is constant. No changes in appearance of the lung parenchyma and the cardiac silhouette.
