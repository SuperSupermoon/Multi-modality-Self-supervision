Left apical pneumothorax is miniscule and there is no appreciable left pleural effusion. Heart is top-normal size. Pulmonary vasculature unremarkable. Chest CT demonstrates rib fractures to better advantage, but there has been no interval increase in displacements. Incidental note is made on reviewing the chest CT of sufficient aortic valvular calcification to be hemodynamically significant.
