The cardiac silhouette continues to be mildly enlarged with improving mild pulmonary edema since the last radiograph. An ascending Swan-Ganz catheter is unchanged with the tip overlying the region of the tricuspid valve. The intra-aortic balloon pump is in the descending aorta approximately at the level of the superior margin of the left main bronchus. There is no pneumothorax.
