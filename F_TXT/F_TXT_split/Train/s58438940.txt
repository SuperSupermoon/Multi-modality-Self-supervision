Lung volumes are within normal limits. An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip is 5.1 cm above the level the carina. A nasogastric tube is in-situ, the tip is not visualized but lies below the left hemidiaphragm, presumed to be in the stomach. The cardiomediastinal contour is normal. There is mild prominence of the bilateral hila without significant pulmonary vascular congestion or evidence of pulmonary edema. Minimal atelectasis of the left costophrenic angle. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
