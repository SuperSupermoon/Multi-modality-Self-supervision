New rightward mediastinal shift despite the development of a small right pleural effusion in the interim indicates substantial new volume loss in the right lung predominantly lower lobe. This can be seen due to aspiration and therefore the patient is probably at risk for developing pneumonia. Left lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Tracheostomy is unremarkable.
