Single AP portable view of the chest. Exam is limited secondary to technique and body habitus. This may account for the increased interstitial markings in part. There is no evidence of focal consolidation or definite effusion noting the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, also likely accentuated due to technique and unchanged from prior. The osseous structures are unremarkable.
