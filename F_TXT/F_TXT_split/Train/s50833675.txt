AP chest compared to ___: Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. It obscures much of the lower lungs, but there is no clear evidence of substantial pulmonary hemorrhage, and no pneumonia or pulmonary edema. How much of the size of the severely enlarged cardiac silhouette is due to cardiomegaly and how much to a pericardial effusion is radiographically indeterminate. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
