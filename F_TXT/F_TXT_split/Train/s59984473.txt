Cardiac silhouette is at least mildly enlarged. A left pectoral pacer is in place with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position with the tip terminating 3.5 cm cranial to the carina. Left greater than right bibasilar opacities are relatively unchanged, as are a moderate right pleural effusion and moderate-to-large left pleural effusion. There is mild vascular congestion . A left internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at the brachiocephalic confluence. There is no pneumothorax.
