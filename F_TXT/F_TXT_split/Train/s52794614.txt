As compared to ___ radiograph, chest tubes remain in place in the right hemi thorax, with the tiny right apical pneumothorax adjacent to surgical chain sutures. New airspace opacities are present in the left upper lobe extending to the left perihilar region. Additionally, a worsening confluent opacity is present in the right lower lung. These findings may be due to multifocal aspiration, asymmetrical edema and less likely rapidly evolving pulmonary infection or hemorrhage. Ste small pleural effusions are again demonstrated bilaterally.
