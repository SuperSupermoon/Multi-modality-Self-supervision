Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is linear right basilar atelectasis/scarring. Relative lucency of the upper lungs also suggests presence of pulmonary emphysema. Skinfold is noted overlying the left upper hemithorax. No pneumothorax is seen. There is no pleural effusion. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. There is no pulmonary edema.
