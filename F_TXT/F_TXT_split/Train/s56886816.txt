Right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium without evidence of pneumothorax. There relatively low lung volumes and the right costophrenic angle not fully included on the image. Given this, no large pleural effusion is seen. Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity is seen which could be due to atelectasis although consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Consider dedicated PA and lateral views if patient able for better evaluation.
