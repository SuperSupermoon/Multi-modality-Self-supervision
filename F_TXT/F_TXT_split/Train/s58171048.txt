There has been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter with its tip in the mid SVC region. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes are again noted. Previously noted nodule projecting over the right upper lung is less conspicuous compared with prior exam. There is mild hilar congestion and equivocal mild interstitial pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen on this supine radiograph. Heart size is unchanged.
