AP chest compared to ___: Previously asymmetric pulmonary edema has more evenly distributed, and improved, particularly in the left lung. There is still substantial bibasilar consolidation, presumably atelectasis, and no appreciable change in moderate right pleural effusion which is distributed differently because of changes in patient's position. Heart is only top normal size. I discussed by telephone with Dr. ___, at 9:30 a.m.
