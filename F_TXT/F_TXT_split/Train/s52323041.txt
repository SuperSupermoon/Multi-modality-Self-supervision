Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Widened mediastinum has improved due to less vascular congestion and less rotation. Bilateral effusions have decreased. Left lower lobe opacity is minimally increased, likely due to almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe. There is no evident pneumothorax. Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is stable. Mild pulmonary edema has improved.
