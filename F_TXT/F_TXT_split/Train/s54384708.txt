Lung volumes are very low and the film is somewhat underpenetrated. Faint bibasilar opacities are similar to yesterday's study and may reflect mild atelectasis; however, pneumonia or aspiration cannot be completely excluded. The heart is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is calcification of the aortic arch. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
