AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. On AP frontal view, appearance of previously described HD catheter unchanged. Heart size not increased. The right-sided pleural effusion appears to have increased again and is now resulting in diffuse basal haze overlying the right lower lobe structures as the fluid apparently is layering in the posterior pleural compartments. There is no evidence of new discrete local pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates which can be identified on this single AP portable chest view. Had a lateral view been repeated similar as ordered on yesterday's examination, the increasing degree of right-sided pleural effusion could have been assessed more appropriately and a possible pneumonia been eliminated with greater assurance.
