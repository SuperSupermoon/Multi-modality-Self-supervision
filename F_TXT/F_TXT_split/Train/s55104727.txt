As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a Dobbhoff catheter. The tip of the catheter projects over the distal parts of the stomach and is likely in prepyloric position. The course of the line is unremarkable. The other monitoring and support devices, including the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, are in unchanged position. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
