1. Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC. There is an increasing left-sided layering pleural effusion with associated airspace opacity at the left base likely representing partial lower lobe collapse. Right lung is low in volume with patchy opacity at the base likely reflecting patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess as the left heart border is obscured by the near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax.
