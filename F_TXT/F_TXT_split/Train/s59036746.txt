Assessment is limited by patient rotation. Heart size appears mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable with atherosclerotic calcifications noted diffusely in the aorta. There is mild pulmonary edema with bibasilar patchy airspace opacities, potentially atelectasis. Small to moderate size bilateral pleural effusions are noted, larger on the right. No large pneumothorax is identified. No displaced fractures are seen. Marked degenerative changes are noted involving both glenohumeral joints.
