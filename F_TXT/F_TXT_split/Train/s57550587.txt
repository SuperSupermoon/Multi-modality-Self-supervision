1. Status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. Interval removal of the right internal jugular introducer catheter. Lung volumes have improved but there is still residual patchy opacity at the right lung base which most likely represents patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax.
