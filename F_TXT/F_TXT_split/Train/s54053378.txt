Cardiomegaly is mild, unchanged. There is minimal interval increase in the mediastinal width, potentially representing vascular enlargement. There is gradual progression of multifocal opacities that might represent pulmonary edema but multifocal infection would be another possibility and correlation with chest CT would be recommended. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
