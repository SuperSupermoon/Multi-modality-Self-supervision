An endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina. A valve prosthesis, right internal jugular catheter, enteric tube, sternal hardware and axillary clips are unchanged. A left internal jugular catheter is seen within the upper SVC with the tip directed toward the lateral wall. A right pigtail chest tube is directed superiorly. Moderate cardiomegaly is again accompanied by severe diffuse pulmonary edema. Further obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and left heart border indicates slight worsening. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed and unchanged.
