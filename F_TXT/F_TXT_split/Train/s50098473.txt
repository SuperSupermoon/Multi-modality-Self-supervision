In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the mid stomach. The side-port appears to be just distal to the esophagogastric junction. The tube could be pushed forward several cm for more optimal positioning. Little change in the other monitoring and support devices and the heart and lungs.
