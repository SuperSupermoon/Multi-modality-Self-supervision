Lung volumes remain quite low, but the only discrete area of atelectasis is at the left base and it is improving. Left basal pleural drainage tube still in place. There is probably a small left pleural effusion but no appreciable left pneumothorax. Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes, probably top-normal. Right lung clear.
