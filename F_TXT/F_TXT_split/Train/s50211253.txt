Right-sided chest tube remains in place with persistent small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with loculated intrafissural component, but no visible pneumothorax. Moderate left pleural effusion has minimally increased since the previous study. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by mild interstitial edema. Persistent left retrocardiac opacity is likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion. Worsening sharply demarcated opacity in right lower lung may reflect post-operative atelectasis in the right middle lobe in this patient reportedly status post the right lower lobe resection. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in size. Left PICC continues to terminate inferiorly within the right atrium.
