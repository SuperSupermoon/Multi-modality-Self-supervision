Left-sided PICC line has its tip projecting over the distal left brachiocephalic vein, unchanged in position from prior taking into account the patient's rotation. Left-sided chest tube is no longer kinked with its side hole about the left chest wall. Small left medial and basilar pneumothorax appears mildly increased compared to prior. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema throughout the left chest wall and both sides of the neck is also mildly increased compared to prior. Dobbhoff and NG tubes have their tips projecting below the diaphragm. The patient is status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through, with residual oral contrast noted in the neo esophagus. Surgical clips are again noted about the mediastinum. Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Consolidative opacities in both lung bases could represent atelectasis, however superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
