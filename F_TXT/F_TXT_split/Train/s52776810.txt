Mild pulmonary edema has improved over the past 24 hours. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is stable. Discrete Lung lesions are largely obscured by the persistent edema. Pleural effusions are small if any. Tip of the endotracheal tube, nearly 3 cm above the carina with the chin partially flexed is standard positioning. The level of the upper esophagus or hypopharynx where the esophageal tube was looped yesterday may not be imaged on this examination, so I doubt note that loop has been reduced, but distally the tube passes into the stomach and out of view. An esophageal probe is still roughly at the level of the carina. There is no pneumothorax.
