As compared to the previous radiograph, the extensive right basal parenchymal opacity is unchanged. The opacity continues to be combined with a pleural effusion. The atelectases at the left lung bases have increased and are now located in the left lower lobe. No left pleural effusion. In the well-ventilated areas of the lungs, there is no evidence of new opacities and no evidence of pulmonary edema. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in constant position.
