The patient is status post recent right apical bleb resection, with confluent opacity in the right lung apex adjacent to surgical chain sutures, likely due to postoperative atelectasis and contusion. A small-to-moderate right pneumothorax is present with apical visceral pleural line at the level of the fourth posterior rib, with a right chest tube in place terminating at the apex. Heart size is normal, and left lung and pleural spaces are clear.
