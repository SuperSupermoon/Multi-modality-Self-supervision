As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have minimally increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation or a stronger inspiratory effort. The predominantly micronodular widespread bilateral parenchymal opacities with some signs indicative of local pulmonary fibrosis are unchanged. No additional opacities. No pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema.
