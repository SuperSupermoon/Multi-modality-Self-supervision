Lung volumes remain quite low. The upper lungs are clear and the pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable. New opacification at the base of the right lung could be atelectasis or recent aspiration. This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. There is no evidence of cardiac decompensation. An esophageal tube is seen in the upper and mid esophagus but the ___ of the tube are uncertain and its tip is not clearly visible.
