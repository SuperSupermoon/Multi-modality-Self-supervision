AP chest compared to ___: Residual opacification in the right lower lung probably due to improving right lower lobe atelectasis. Followup advised to detect pneumonia that might have followed aspiration. Previous right middle lobe collapse has resolved. Increased mediastinal caliber suggests central venous distention from volume overload or right heart dysfunction. Moderate cardiomegaly worsened slightly. Low lung volumes makes it difficult to assess if mild interstitial edema has developed. Probable small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends in the SVC. Tubing projecting over the right neck, paramedian chest, and upper abdomen is unclear. Clinical correlation is needed. Tracheostomy tube and the atrio-biventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in their respective standard positions. No pneumothorax.
