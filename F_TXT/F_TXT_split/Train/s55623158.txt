The patient is status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. The faint opacities in the right upper lobe have improved but there is increasing interstitial prominence as well as more focal patchy opacity at the left base. Given the acute fluctuations, findings favor mild interstitial edema rather than an infectious process. No large effusions. No pneumothorax.
