In comparison with the study of ___, there is still diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with severe pulmonary edema. This may be slightly less prominent on the current study, though it could merely reflect slightly better inspiration. Opacification at the left base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss and layering pleural effusion. The right hemidiaphragm is relatively well seen on this study.
