There is a small left apical pneumothorax which was not apparent previously. The left lung apex now lies approximately 15 mm below the inferior margin of the left first rib. There is minimal streaky density at the lung bases consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. The lungs appear otherwise clear mediastinal structures are stable. Bilateral chest tubes, a mediastinal drain and a right internal jugular catheter remain in place.
