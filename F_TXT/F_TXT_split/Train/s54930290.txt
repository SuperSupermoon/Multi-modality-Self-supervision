Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position. Cardiac silhouette has slightly decreased in size, and pulmonary vascular congestion has slightly improved in the interval.

Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are unchanged as well as an area of atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region.
