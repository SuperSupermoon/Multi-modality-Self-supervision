The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 3 cm above the carinal. An orogastric tube reverses course in the distal esophagus and heads back into the hypopharynx. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including a moderate sized hiatal hernia, similar to prior findings. Aside from minor atelectasis associated with the hernia, the lungs appear clear.
