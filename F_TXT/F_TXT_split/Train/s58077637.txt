Portable upright radiograph of the chest. A right apical pneumothorax persists, and is perhaps slightly smaller than on the prior study performed two days ago. There is persistent subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall. There is no evidence of tension. The pneumomediastinum is less apparent on the study. Subtle small right inferolateral pulmonary opacities persist. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is a small amount of bilateral basilar atelectasis. The left costophrenic angle is blunted.
