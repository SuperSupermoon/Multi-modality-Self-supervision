Frontal radiograph of the chest shows unchanged right internal jugular catheter, enteric tube, and endotracheal tube positioning. Compared to the prior radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature and cardiac silhouette, however there is mild to moderate pulmonary edema with increased caliber of the right mediastinal border owing to venous engorgement. There has been interval improvement in the right pleural effusion with likely minimal bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. No focal consolidation is seen.
