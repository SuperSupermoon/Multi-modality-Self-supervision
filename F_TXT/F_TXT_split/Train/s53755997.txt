Single frontal upright chest radiograph demonstrates increased multifocal opacifications particularly evident in the right upper lung and the left mid lung. Though this may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, this is concerning for multifocal pneumonia, likely due to aspiration given the changing appearance across multiple radiographs. No pneumothoraces identified. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Medical support devices are stable in position.
