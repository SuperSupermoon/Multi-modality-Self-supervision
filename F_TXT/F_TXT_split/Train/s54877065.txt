Radiograph centered at thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessment of a nasogastric tube, which is now positioned proximally within the stomach. Side port is likely just above the GE junction level. The imaged portions of the lungs are clear. Within the imaged abdomen, contrast is present within both renal collecting systems. Correlation with timing of recent contrast injection is suggested as well as correlation with renal function.
