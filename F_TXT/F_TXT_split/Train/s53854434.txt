As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the right internal jugular vein catheter, the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. The lung volumes continue to remain low but increased radiolucency could indicate improved ventilation. There is on going elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, with minimal volume loss at the level of the right lower lobe and deviation of the mediastinal structures to the right but the right lung base appears better ventilated than on the previous image. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No new parenchymal opacities, no pleural effusions.
