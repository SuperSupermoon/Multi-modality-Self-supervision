Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in this patient with known aortic dissection. Interval appearance of a triangular opacity overlying the left heart as well as obscuration of the left costophrenic angle. These findings together likely reflect partial lower lobe collapse with an associated layering left effusion, less likely an infectious process. Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No right effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax.
