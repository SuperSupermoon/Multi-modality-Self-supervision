ET tube has been exchanged by a tracheostomy with its tip currently 4.3 cm above the carinal. The tip of the tracheostomy is slightly impinging the left tracheal wall and should be readjusted. There is no substantial change in the widespread opacification of the left hemothorax with element of atelectasis. Right upper lobe opacity appears to be slightly increased. Right pleural effusion is at least moderate.
