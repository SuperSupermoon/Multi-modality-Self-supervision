AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: A large region of heterogeneous opacification in the right mid and lower lung zone accompanied by small right pleural effusion, top normal heart size, and similar but less severe abnormality on the left. I suspect this is aspiration pneumonia in the setting of borderline cardiac decompensation. Dr. ___ was paged.
