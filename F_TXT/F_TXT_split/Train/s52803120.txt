Since ___:10 following insertion of a pigtail pleural drainage catheter at the base of the left chest chest, the previous moderate to large left pleural effusion has been substantially drained and there is no pneumothorax. Moderate right pleural effusion persists. Pulmonary vasculature is congested, but I doubt that pulmonary edema is present. Mild cardiomegaly is improved. ET tube is in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes into the duodenum and out of view.
