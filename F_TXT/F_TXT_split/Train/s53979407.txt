A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates left mediastinal clips. Heart size is again mildly enlarged, not substantially changed. Pulmonary edema is increased compared to the prior exam from earlier the same day, now moderate to severe. Again seen are bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right. Probable bibasilar atelectasis is present. There is no pneumothorax.
