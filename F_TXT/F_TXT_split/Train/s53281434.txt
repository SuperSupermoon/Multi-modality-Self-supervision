The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG with expected postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. There is a moderate amount of free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm. Left hemidiaphragm is elevated and there is patchy opacity at the left base which may reflect atelectasis or chronic postoperative changes, although an acute infectious process cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is advised. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Several surgical clips are seen in the left upper quadrant. Streaky linear opacity at the right base most likely reflects atelectasis. A portion of an aortic stent is visualized in the mid abdomen.
