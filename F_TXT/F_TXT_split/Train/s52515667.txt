Bilateral lung volumes are low. Endotracheal tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina, orogastric tube ends into the stomach, and left subclavian line tip is in mid SVC. Increased retrocardiac opacity is better since yesterday. Mild to moderately enlarged heart size is stable, and mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. No discrete opacities in right lung.
