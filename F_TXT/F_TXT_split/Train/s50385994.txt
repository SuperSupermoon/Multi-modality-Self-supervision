The right subclavian PICC line now appears to have its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Endotracheal tube and right chest tube are unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema again noted. No definite pneumothorax is seen, although this is somewhat difficult given the positioning of the patient on this study and patient rotation. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. There is persistent patchy opacity at the left base. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions.
