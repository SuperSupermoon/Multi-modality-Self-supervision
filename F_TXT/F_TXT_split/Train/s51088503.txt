Extremely low lung volumes have worsened, and therefore new opacification at the base of the left lung could be due to atelectasis, or early pneumonia. Low lung volumes exaggerate the caliber of pulmonary vessels and heart size, but I do not believe there is edema. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of the nondistended stomach.
