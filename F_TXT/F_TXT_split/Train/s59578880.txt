As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The patient has received a right PICC line. The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the mid SVC. Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta but no evidence of pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumonia.
