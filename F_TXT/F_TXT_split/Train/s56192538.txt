Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 4 cm above the carina. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for low lung volumes and supine portable technique. Widespread consolidation has developed throughout the right lung, as well as new left retrocardiac opacity. Observed findings could reflect widespread aspiration given clinically suspected aspiration event. Moderate-to-large layering right pleural effusion is present, as well as an apparent area of loculated fluid medially at the right apex adjacent to the right mediastinal contour. Extrapleural or mediastinal hematoma could produce a similar appearance, and clinical correlation is suggested regarding whether any intervention has been performed in this region. Dr. ___ was reached by telephone to discuss these findings on ___ at 7:30 a.m. at the time of discovery.
