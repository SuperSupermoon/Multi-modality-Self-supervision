ET tube has been advanced, tip approximately 2 cm from the carina with the chin in neutral position. It should not be advanced further. Widespread pulmonary edema has worsened accompanied by increasing pleural effusions. Heart size is top-normal. The concurrence of worsening edema and new effusions is more typical of volume dependent edema than noncardiac edema although the distinction is not diagnostic. Left jugular line ends in the upper right atrium. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
