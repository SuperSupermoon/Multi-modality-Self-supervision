Lung volumes are again low. A generalized increase in the radiodensity in the lower lungs could be due to edema, less likely to pneumonia, although this is still conceivable if the patient's clinical picture fits. Bibasilar streaky atelectasis remains. Patient is status post median sternotomy. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal.
