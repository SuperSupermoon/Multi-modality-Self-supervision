Stable cardiomegaly, but slight improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion. Perihilar haziness and peribronchial cuffing have also slightly improved. Asymmetrically distributed consolidation with right perihilar and lower lobe predominance likely represents a pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Followup radiographs would be helpful to document resolution. Adjacent small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is noted.
