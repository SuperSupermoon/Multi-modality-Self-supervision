Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Stable bandlike opacity in the right upper lobe likely related to the patient's history of lung cancer. Interval appearance of a 1.3 cm peripheral nodular opacity in the right mid lung which would be concerning for metastasis or possibly new primary. Heterogeneous appearance to the left fifth and sixth posterior ribs which may reflect superimposed external structures, but raise the possibility of bony metastasis. This can be better assessed on followup imaging. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient positioning. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
