Compared with the prior study, the previous left pneumothorax has now significantly enlarged, without evidence of mediastinal shift. No change in right-sided pigtail catheter. The left-sided pigtail catheter appears to have been rotated. Previous right apical pneumothorax is no longer detected. The endotracheal tube projects 3.6 cm above the carina. A right IJ central line is unchanged in position. Multiple cavitary lesions in the lungs are re- demonstrated.
