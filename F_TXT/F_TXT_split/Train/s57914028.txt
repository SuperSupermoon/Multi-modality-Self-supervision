There is stable moderate cardiomegaly. The hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Again seen is diffusely increased interstitial markings of the lungs, particularly at the bilateral bases, which are consistent with patient's chronic interstitial lung disease. Bullous disease is again noted at the left lung apex, not significantly changed from the prior studies and related to patient's emphysema. There appears to be a new consolidation at the left lower lobe compared to the prior exam. No pneumothorax is identified. There is no large pleural effusion. Note is made of bibasilar atelectasis. Loss of the right heart border is due to the patient's pectus.
