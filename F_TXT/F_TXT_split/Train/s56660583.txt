AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging: Aside from a band of atelectasis at the left base, the non-obscured portions of both lungs are clear. Small retrocardiac opacity abutting the descending thoracic aorta has a sharply circumscribed border, could be atelectasis or a mass, but is unlikely to be pneumonia. When feasible, conventional radiographs of CT scan should be performed, since the lateral view would be particularly helpful. Other abnormalities to question are small right pleural effusion and the possibility of a 10 mm wide nodule projecting over the right second anterior interspace. A sigmoidal length of tubing projects over the right lower lung, and could be external. Clinical correlation advised. Dr. ___ was paged at 9 a.m. when the findings were recognized and I discussed the findings with two house officers caring for this patient over the ensuing ___ mninutes.
