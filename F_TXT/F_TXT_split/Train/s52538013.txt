In comparison with the prior radiograph, the dobhoff tube is now malpositioned with the tip in the esophagus, and should be advanced. There is a right subclavian catheter, which is unchanged in positioning, terminating in the low SVC. There are bilateral layering pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, which are stable in size compared to prior. The previously visualized pulmonary edema has resolved. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is no pneumothorax.
