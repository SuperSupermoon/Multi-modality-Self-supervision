A right pigtail catheter in the right lung base is in unchanged position. However, there is slight interval increase in the small right hydropneumothorax as compared to most recent prior from one day ago. Fluid is now seen within the minor fissure as well. Overall, aeration of the lungs appears unchanged. Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are noted. There is slight progressive collapse of the right middle lobe over time.
