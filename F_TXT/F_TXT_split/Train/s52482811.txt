As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increasing signs suggestive of pulmonary edema, notably on the right, which might be caused by a change in patient position. On the other hand, the opacities on the left have mildly decreased in severity. There still is a small right pleural effusion with evidence of right atelectasis, as well as moderate cardiomegaly. The nasogastric tube is in unchanged position. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
