Compared to preoperative chest radiographs on ___ and ___. Patient had an extremely large diaphragmatic hernia, involving stomach loops of bowel and other upper abdominal contents. Now there is a large loculated air containing space infra medial to the left lung, which could be either in the mediastinum or pleural space. I can't identify the plane of left hemidiaphragm. Is also impossible to say whether there is pneumothorax along the lateral costal surface of the left upper lobe and also in the right lower chest where there is clearly new atelectasis. Severe subcutaneous emphysema involves upper abdomen both sides of the chest and extends into the neck. Heart is not enlarged and there is no edema or consolidation in the upper lobes.
