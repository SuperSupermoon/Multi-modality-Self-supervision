Since the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been repositioned, with the tip now projecting over the expected location of the main pulmonary trunk. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.6 cm above the carina. Enteric tube extends at least the body of the stomach. There is a catheter projecting over the right upper abdomen. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is likely stable, accounting for slightly lower lung volumes. Haziness at the right lung base suggests a layering pleural effusion. No sizable pleural effusion on the left. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is mildly enlarged, stable.
