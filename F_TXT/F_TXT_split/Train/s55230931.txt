Re-identified are bilateral upper thoracic and cervical spine posterior spinal fusion rods with multilevel transpedicular screws, not appreciably changed in appearance. Anterior cervical spine fusion hardware is also re-identified, unchanged. There is a right chest port with distal catheter tip not definitively visualized, obscured by superimposed spinal fusion hardware, but seen at least to the level of the high right atrium. EKG leads overlie the chest. Right-sided chest tube is seen with tip projecting over the medial right mid lung. There are low lung volumes. There is unchanged at least moderate cardiomegaly. There is crowding of the normal bronchovascular structures. Hazy opacity with in the right mid and lower lung is unchanged, likely representing a combination of layering pleural fluid and atelectasis. There is no new focal lung consolidation. There is no pneumothorax. There is no sizable left pleural effusion.
