Dobbhoff tube is seen coiled in the stomach, tip pointing towards the gastric fundus and does not appeared to be post-pyloric position. The patient has known right hydropneumothorax with apparent increase in pleural fluid which is likely due in large part to the patient being supine on this study, with layering fluid as opposed to upright on the prior studies. There has been interval increase in perihilar opacities that may be due to mild edema. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
