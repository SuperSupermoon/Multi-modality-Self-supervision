As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged correct position. The lung volumes have minimally decreased. A pre-existing left pleural effusion has minimally increased, with an increasing retrocardiac and left basilar atelectasis. Taking into account decreased lung volumes, there is no substantial change in appearance of the right lung. No overt pulmonary edema.
