There has been interval placement of biventricular pacemaker with leads in expected location. However, the relationship with the ventricular walls cannot be appreciated in one view. Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiomediastinal silhouette and interstitial opacities. However, the heart is mildly enlarged.Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema, pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.Right-sided Port-A-Cath likely terminates in the low SVC.
