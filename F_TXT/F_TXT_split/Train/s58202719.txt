Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. There are persistent low lung volumes. Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions have increased on the left. Right lower lobe opacity has increased, likely due to worsening atelectasis. Moderate pulmonary edema is stable. Irregular left perihilar opacities are unchanged, could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated.
