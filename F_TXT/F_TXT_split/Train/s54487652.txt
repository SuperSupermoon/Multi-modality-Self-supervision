One of two right-sided pleural tubes has been removed in the interval, with no substantial change in appearance of loculated hydropneumothoraces at the right lung apex. However, dependent pleural fluid at the costophrenic sulcus has increased and is now moderate in size. Adjacent right basilar opacity has also worsened and may reflect atelectasis and/or infectious consolidation. Scattered linear opacities in the right mid and lower lung regions appear unchanged. Overall improved aeration of the left lung with persistent small left pleural effusion and near resolution of left basilar atelectasis.
