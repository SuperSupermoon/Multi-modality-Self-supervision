A single portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained. Low lung volumes crowd the central pulmonary vasculature. In addition, prominence of the upper lobe vasculature may suggest a mild degree of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. Aortic arch calcifications are mild. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumoperitoneum.
