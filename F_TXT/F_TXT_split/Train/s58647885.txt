Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The exam is suboptimal due to underpenetration, particularly at the left costophrenic angle due to patient body habitus. There are also low lung volumes. The cardiac silhouette remains moderately to severely enlarged. The left lung base is not well evaluated due to underpenetration. No large pleural effusion is seen, but a small effusion would be difficult to exclude. There is mild prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature, which may be due to pulmonary vascular congestion or could be related to low lung volumes.
