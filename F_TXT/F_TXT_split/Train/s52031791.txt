Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and accompanied by pulmonary vascular engorgement, asymmetrical perihilar opacities (right greater than left), and widespread interstitial opacities. Findings are most consistent with asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but superimposed secondary process in the right lung such as aspiration or infectious pneumonia is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard. Bilateral small pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
