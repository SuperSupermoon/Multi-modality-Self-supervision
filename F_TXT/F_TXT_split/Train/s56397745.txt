A small left apical pneumothorax is slightly enlarged from the prior examination. A right Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The patient is post CABG. The heart size remains normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours remain within normal limits. Bibasilar opacities, reflecting metastases from known rectal cancer, are again demonstrated.
