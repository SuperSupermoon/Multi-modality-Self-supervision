As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of moderate pulmonary edema, combined to cardiomegaly, enlargement of the azygos vein and of the right upper mediastinum. Today's radiograph shows more obvious evidence of a small left pleural effusion. On the right, no effusion is seen. Atelectasis is present at both the left and the right lung bases. No evidence of new parenchymal opacities, no suggestion of pneumonia. A double-lumen catheter inserted over the left is in constant position.
