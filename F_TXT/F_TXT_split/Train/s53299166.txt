Single frontal semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There are prominent bilateral predominantly perihilar opacities which may be due to severe pulmonary edema/ARDS, possible multifocal infection. There is blunting of the costophrenic angles and small pleural effusions are not excluded. The cardiac silhouette is likely top normal to mildly enlarged, although not well assessed due to right lung base opacities. Aortic knob is calcified. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
