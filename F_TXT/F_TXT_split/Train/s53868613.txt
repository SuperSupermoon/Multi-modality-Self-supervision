Stable cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema. Linear atelectasis is present in both mid lung regions, and additional patchy opacities are present at the lung bases, likely due to additional foci of atelectasis, although aspiration and developing pneumonia are additional considerations in the appropriate clinical settings. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
