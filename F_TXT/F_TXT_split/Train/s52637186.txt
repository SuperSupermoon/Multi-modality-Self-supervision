On the current radiograph, the partially visualized ribs appear normal. There is no visible rib fracture, notably on the left. If the clinically presentation persists, additional dedicated rib series should be acquired to rule out the presence of a rib fracture. Relatively low lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pleural effusions. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.
