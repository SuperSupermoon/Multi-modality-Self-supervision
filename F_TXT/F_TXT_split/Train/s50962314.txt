In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is been placement of a nasogastric tube that is difficult to see but apparently extends into the stomach. Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Right IJ catheter extends to the lower SVC. Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
