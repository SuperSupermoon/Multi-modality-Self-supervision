As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette and mild bilateral symmetrical enlargement of the hilar structures, likely caused by enlargement of the pulmonary arteries. There is massive soft tissue overlay on today's image, causing overall increased radiodensity of the lung parenchyma. However, there is no indication for an acute process such as pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis might be present. No pneumothorax.
