AP chest compared to ___: No persistent left pneumothorax, apical pleural tube in place. Small left pleural effusion and left basal atelectasis stable. Previous mild pulmonary edema is clearing. Residual consolidation at the right lung base could be asymmetric edema, though neither atelectasis nor pneumonia is excluded. Right pleural effusion is small, if any. No pneumothorax. Heart mildly enlarged, unchanged. Mediastinal caliber does not suggest elevated central venous pressure.
