Severe heterogeneous consolidation throughout the left lung and right mid and lower lung zones unchanged, consistent with widespread pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. There is now a sufficient lucent see surrounding the upper and medial aspects of the left lung to question pneumothorax, although recent right lobectomy would make pneumo mediastinum more likely. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. ET tube in standard position. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.
