AP chest compared to ___ Previous right lower lobe pneumonia has cleared. Base of the left lung is elevated, and there is some decrease in aeration of the left lung base. Lateral view would be most helpful in determining if there is enough abnormality in the left lower lobe to call it pneumonia. It would also be useful to see if there are findings to suggest a subpulmonic left pleural effusion. This may ultimately require left decubitus imaging of the chest for assessment. Heart size is top normal, exaggerated by AP positioning, but it should be remembered that patients with SLE are at risk of pericarditis.
