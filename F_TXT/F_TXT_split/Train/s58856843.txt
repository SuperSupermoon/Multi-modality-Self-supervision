Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Lungs are essentially clear with no definitive opacities that might be consistent with aspiration. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Surgical clip is projecting over the left upper mediastinum and might reflect potential closure of ductus arteriosus, please correlate with the patient's history.
