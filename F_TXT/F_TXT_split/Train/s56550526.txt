The enteric tube, right IJ central line, and ET tube remain in satisfactory position. There is a stable degree of rightward deviation of the right IJ central line, which is presumed to be secondary to prominent vascularity. New blunting of the left costophrenic angle is likely due to a small pleural effusion. Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis is also unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Right shoulder degenerative changes are present.
