Portable AP supine view of the chest was reviewed. The lateral aspect of the right chest was excluded. A tracheostomy ends 5 cm above the carina. Right-sided hemodialysis catheter and PICC line end in the mid superior vena cava. The upper enteric tube enters the stomach and ends off of the radiograph. Increased vascular volume and an interval increase in moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema reflect volume overload or biventricular heart failure. Median sternotomy wires are aligned and intact. Lung volumes are low and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Top normal heart size is unchanged.
