As compared to ___ radiograph, endotracheal tube is in standard position, as well as a left subclavian vascular catheter and nasogastric tube. Abrupt widening of cardiomediastinal contours is likely due to a combination of increased volume status of the patient along with accentuation by lower lung volumes and supine technique. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by mild edema. Known right upper lobe mass and poorly defined left upper lobe lung nodules are seen to better detail on separately dictated CT of the chest from the same date.
