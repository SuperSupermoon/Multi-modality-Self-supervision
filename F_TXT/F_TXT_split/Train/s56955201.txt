A single portable view of the chest. Indistinctness of the pulmonary vascular markings is seen. There is no definite confluent consolidation. Blunting of the costophrenic angles may be due to small effusions, more apparent on the left. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but given lower lung volumes and portable technique has not significantly changed. No acute osseous abnormality detected.
