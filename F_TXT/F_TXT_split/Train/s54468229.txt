A single semi-erect portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. Small bilateral pleural effusions are better appreciated on the outside hospital CT from earlier today at 5:32 p.m. Bibasilar and right mid lung heterogeneous opacities are at least partially due to compressive atelectasis, although a concomitant bibasilar process such as aspiration pneumonitis or infection is thought likely. There is no pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. Enlargement of the aortic knob and descending thoracic aortic contours likely relate to a known intramural hematoma, as seen on CT from ___.
