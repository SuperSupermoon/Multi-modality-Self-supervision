In comparison to the prior radiograph of 2 days earlier, support and monitoring devices remain in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities have slightly improved, likely due to improving pulmonary edema. Residual opacities involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left likely reflect a combination of residual edema and infectious pneumonia. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are again demonstrated.
