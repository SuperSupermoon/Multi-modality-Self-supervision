There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 5 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. The side port of the nasogastric tube has migrated slightly more proximal and could be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal placement. There is a left-sided PICC line with the distal lead tip in the mid SVC. A right-sided pleural catheter is seen. There are no pneumothoraces. There is improvement of the pulmonary edema. There are hazy opacities at the lung bases which may represent atelectasis, resolving pulmonary edema, or developing infiltrates.
