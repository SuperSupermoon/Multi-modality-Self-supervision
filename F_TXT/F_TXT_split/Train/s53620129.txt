Left PICC terminates at the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava. Previously reported focal opacity in the left mid lung region has partially cleared and may reflect a slowly resolving pneumonia. Lungs are otherwise clear except for linear atelectasis at the left lung base.
