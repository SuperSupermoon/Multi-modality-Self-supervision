Interval removal of right pleural catheter, with slight increase in size of moderate to large, partially loculated right pleural effusion. Hydropneumothorax component along the upper lateral margin of the fluid collection has slightly decreased, however. Right juxtahilar mass-like opacity appears similar to the prior study, but there is now worsening opacity in the right lower lobe, which could be due to aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Left lung is grossly clear, and there is no evidence of left pleural effusion or left pneumothorax.
