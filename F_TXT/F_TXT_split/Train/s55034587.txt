AP chest compared to ___ and ___, 8:32 a.m. Lower lung volumes may account for greater opacification in the right lower lung compared to 8:30 a.m. Left lower lobe remains airless, presumably consolidated, but raising concern for airway occlusion by retained secretions. There is at least a moderate left pleural effusion. No definite pneumothorax. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is comparable to the preoperative appearance. Right subclavian line ends in the upper right atrium, and would need to be withdrawn 2 cm to be located with confidence in the low SVC.
