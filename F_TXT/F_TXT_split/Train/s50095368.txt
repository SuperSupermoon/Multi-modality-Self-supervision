Comparison is made with prior study, ___. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm likely in the stomach. ET tube tip is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the right atrium, can be withdrawal couple of centimeters for more standard position. There are low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with mild cardiomegaly. There is mild vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax. If any, there is a small right pleural effusion. Increasing opacities in the right mid lung are likely atelectasis. Attention in this area is recommended in followup study to assess a developing infection or aspiration.
