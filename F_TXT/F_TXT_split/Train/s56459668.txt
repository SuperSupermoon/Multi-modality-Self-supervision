EKG leads overlie the chest. The patient is rotated to the right on the current exam. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. The hila are unremarkable. There is diffuse left lung patchy/hazy airspace opacity which appears worsened/new in comparison to earlier same-day CT of the chest even when allowing for inter-modality differences. The right lung is grossly clear. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax or sizable pleural effusion.
