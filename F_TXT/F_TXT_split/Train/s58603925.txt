New opacification at the left lung base obscures the left hemidiaphragm, may be accompanied by mild leftward mediastinal shift indicating a component of atelectasis, but pneumonia particularly due to aspiration is of great concern, since there is a also a new smaller region of consolidation at the medial aspect of the right lower lobe. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. The heart is not enlarged and there is no pulmonary edema. New left supraclavicular dual channel hemodialysis catheter ends in the low SVC. There is no associated mediastinal widening, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
