Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. Suture in the left mid lung is again noted reflecting old surgery. There is a stable pattern of widespread ground-glass opacity which likely reflects known interstitial lung disease. No significant change from prior exam allowing for slight differences in technique/lung volumes. Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures are intact.
