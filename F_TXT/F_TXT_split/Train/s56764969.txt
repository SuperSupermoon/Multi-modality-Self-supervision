1. Right internal jugular central line with its tip in the mid to distal SVC. There is widening of the right paratracheal soft tissues with a rounded contour suggestive of a mass lesion. Although this may represent a mediastinal hematoma related to recent line placement, the presence of a mediastinal mass or lymphadenopathy should also be considered. In the absence of comparison studies, further imaging evaluation with CT may be helpful. Lung volumes are low with streaky bibasilar opacity suggestive of atelectasis. Heart is upper limits of normal in size given portable technique. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Crowding of vasculature in the setting of low lung volumes. No large effusions. No pneumothorax. Results were communicated by phone CJ, the patient's nurse on ___ at 9:23 a.m. at the time of discovery.
