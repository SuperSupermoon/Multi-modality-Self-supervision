Rotated positioning. ET tube tip approximately 5.7 cm above the carina at the level of the lower clavicular heads. NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film. A right subclavian PICC line tip most likely overlies proximal SVC, allowing for rotation. Additional tubing with pigtail tip over the lower left chest or upper left abdomen is again noted. Again seen is marked cardiomegaly. On today's exam, the focal opacities in the left lung apex appear slightly improved. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with air bronchograms remains present, similar to the prior film. Vascular plethora in the right lung is consistent with ongoing CHF. Probable small right of fusion, with right base atelectasis, similar to the prior film.
