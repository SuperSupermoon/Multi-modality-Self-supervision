The lung volumes are low. There is evidence of prior aortic aneurysm repair with enlarging soft tissue opacity projecting over the left mid zone, larger compared to the prior radiograph. Likely small left pleural effusion. Right lung is clear. No significant interval change in bony thorax compared to the prior radiograph.
