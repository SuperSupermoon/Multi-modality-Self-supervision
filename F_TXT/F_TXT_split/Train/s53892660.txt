There is stable airspace and interstitial process throughout the left lung as well as an unchanged right pneumothorax with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes. The right pleural catheter remains in place at the lung base. The left internal jugular Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged. Overall, when compared to the prior study, there has been no significant interval change.
