Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are also unremarkable. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. Bibasilar patchy airspace opacities most likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No displaced fractures are seen. Thoracic fusion hardware is incompletely assessed.
