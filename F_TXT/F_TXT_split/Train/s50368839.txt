On a background of severe emphysema as well as biapical bulla and fibrotic changes including bronchiectasis, the latter suggestive of sarcoid, there is new left lower and mid lung ground-glass reticular opacification concerning for infection. Reticular pattern likely reflects underlying lung abnormality. There is associated left hemidiaphragm elevation, probably largely due to a significantly distended stomach, though may be in small part explained by an element of inherent collapse within the left lung opacification. The appearance of luncency projecting over the proximal esophagus is likely due to apical bullae in a rotated patient, though esophageal dilatation is another consideration.
