The right PICC line is seen with distal tip projecting over the right atrium. It is recommended to retract PICC line by approximately 3 cm for placement in the lower SVC. Oblique positioning limits further evaluation of mediastinal structures and lung parenchyma. Grossly, there are no notable interval changes as compared to prior radiograph.
