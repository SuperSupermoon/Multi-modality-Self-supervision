Compared to ___, a Swan-___ catheter has been placed, with tip difficult to assess due to overlap of multiple overlying monitoring leads, but probably terminating in the right pulmonary artery. Repeat radiograph following repositioned main or removal of external monitoring leads would be helpful in this regard. There is no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and resolving interstitial pulmonary edema. Moderate right pleural effusion and adjacent right basilar lung opacification are again demonstrated.
