In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is increased opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm, reflecting some combination of effusion and volume loss at the left base with possible superimposed aspiration or pneumonia. No convincing evidence of pneumothorax. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, suggesting elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Right subclavian PICC line extends to the level of the cavoatrial junction or possibly the upper portion of the right atrium.
