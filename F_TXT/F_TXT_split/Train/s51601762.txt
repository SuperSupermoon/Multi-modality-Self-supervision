Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiac size is top normal. There are low lung volumes. The aorta is tortuous. Aside from atelectasis in the right upper lobe, the lungs are grossly clear. ET tube is in a standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. There is a third line that could be a catheter projecting over the left side of the neck of the patient and the tip projects at the level of the aortic arch; I am unsure of the exact position of this tube, could be outside the patient.
