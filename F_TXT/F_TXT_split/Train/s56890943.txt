1. Tracheostomy tube in unchanged position. Right subclavian central line with its tip in the mid-to-distal SVC, unchanged. Interval placement of a right chest tube, which has its tip crossing the midline approximately 3 cm lateral to the vertebral bodies. Repositioning is advised. The patient subsequently had the chest tube pulled back on subsequent imaging performed on ___ at 1:36 a.m. 2. Layering right effusion and left effusion with more focal airspace consolidation at the left base with the presence of air bronchograms. Although this may represent compressive atelectasis, pneumonia should also be considered. Linear opacity in the left mid lung likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal contours are difficult to assess given marked patient rotation to the left.
