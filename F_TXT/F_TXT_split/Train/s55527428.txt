A new dual lead pacemaker/ ICD device has been placed. Its leads terminate in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. There is no pneumothorax. As before, there is similar mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. There is noted definite pleural effusion. There is again mild to moderate pulmonary edema. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.
