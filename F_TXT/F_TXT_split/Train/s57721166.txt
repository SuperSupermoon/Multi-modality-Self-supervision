An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and into the stomach with the tip projecting at the level of the pylorus or first portion of the duodenum. A left subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged terminating in the low SVC. The endotracheal tube terminates 8.5 cm from the carina, similar to the prior study. Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding. A moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged. A small to moderate right pleural effusion is partially imaged as the right costophrenic sulcus is excluded from the field of view. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank edema is similar. A rounded density in the right upper quadrant may represent a small gallstone.
