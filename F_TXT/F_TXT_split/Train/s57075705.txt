There is no significant change compared to prior examination. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged with redemonstration of vague paramediastinal linear opacities suggestive of radiation fibrosis. The inferior lung fields are increased in density from overlapping breast prostheses. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
