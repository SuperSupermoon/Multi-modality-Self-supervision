The lung volumes are low. The patient is intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina. The patient also has a nasogastric tube. The tip of this tube is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction, the tip should be advanced by approximately 5 to 10 cm. Moderate cardiomegaly and increased vascular diameters indicate mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. In addition, there are rather extensive alveolar opacities in the retrocardiac lung areas and in the entire central portions of the right lung. These might reflect additional pneumonia or aspiration. Close radiographic monitoring is required. There is no evidence of pleural effusions or of pneumothorax.
