In comparison with the study of ___, it is very difficult to visualize the tip of the endotracheal tube due to overlying spinal fusion device. However, the tip is definitely at or above the thoracic inlet. Left subclavian catheter is unchanged. Nasogastric tube remains coiled within the fundus of the stomach. Hazy opacification at the left base with retrocardiac opacification is again consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. On the right, there is increased opacification at the base consistent with worsening atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
