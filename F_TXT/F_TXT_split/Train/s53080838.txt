Evaluation is limited by patient rotation. Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right atrium. Heart size appears grossly unchanged, borderline enlarged. Mediastinal contour is similar. There are low lung volumes with crowding of bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is present. There is interval improvement in aeration of the right lung base, with minimal residual patchy opacities in both lung bases which may reflect atelectasis. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Dense tubular structure is noted within the region of the right internal jugular vein, unchanged
