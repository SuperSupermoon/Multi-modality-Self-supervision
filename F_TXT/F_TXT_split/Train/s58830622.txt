The patient's mandible obscures the right apex. There continues to be elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. There is a patchy opacity at the left base which may reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. Overall, the lung volumes are diminished but the right lung is grossly clear. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Heart is stably enlarged. Evaluation of mediastinal contours is limited due to marked patient rotation.
