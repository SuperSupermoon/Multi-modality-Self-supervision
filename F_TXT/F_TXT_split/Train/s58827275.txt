AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Greater opacification of the left lower lobe is now accompanied by more marked increase in the height of the left hemidiaphragm. Findings are best explained by worsening atelectasis, perhaps in the presence of diminished left hemidiaphragm excursion, either muscular or neural in origin. Right lung is clear. Heart size is normal. The function of the left hemidiaphragm can be determined by fluoroscopic or ultrasound observation. If the hemidiaphragm moves appropriately, then investigation should be turned to the patency of the bronchial tree. Dr. ___ was telephoned to report these findings, at 2 p.m.
