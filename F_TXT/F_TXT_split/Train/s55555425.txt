Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. Again seen is the right chest tube with tip at the medial aspect of the right lung. Retraction by approximately 14 cm would result in a location at the right lung apex. There is minimal residual right pneumothorax. Extensive right chest wall emphysema is again noted as well as displaced right rib fractures.
