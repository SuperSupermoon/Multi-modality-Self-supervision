Interval placement of tracheostomy tube, terminating in the trachea approximately 3.3 cm above the carina. No radiographic evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Lower lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures, limiting assessment of the cardiovascular status of the patient. This likely accounts for patchy juxtahilar opacities, but attention to these regions on followup radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be helpful in order to exclude pulmonary edema or aspiration in these regions.
