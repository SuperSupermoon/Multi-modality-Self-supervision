Moderate pulmonary edema has improved since ___ at 5:05 p.m.: Right PIC line has been partially withdrawn, tip projecting at the level of the superior cavoatrial junction. Withdrawing the catheter 2.5 cm would ensure that it is in the low third of the SVC. Small right pleural effusion persists. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal vascular caliber is unremarkable.
