FINDINGS and IMPRESSION: There are diffuse interstitial opacities seen within both lungs, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. Increased consolidation behind the left heart may reflect atelectasis but repeat imaging after diuresis is recommended. There is no definite pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The heart is mildly enlarged. Prominence of the right hilus may reflect underlying lymphadenopathy but this is impossible to discern given the extensive edema. Endotracheal tube is 2.4 cm above the carina with the neck in neutral position. This could be withdrawn by 1-2 cm to prevent intermittent right mainstem intubation with neck flexion. An enteric tube courses along the esophagus and enters the stomach, heading superiorly, presumably within a hiatal hernia. A right ventricular lead, from a left side dual lead pacer, takes an unusual course but is likely within the coronary sinus. Dense calcfications project over the left heart and are thought to reflect a combination of both aortic and aortic valve calcifications, raising concern for aortic stenosis. Splenic calcifications are present.
