Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates little improvement in the left lung opacities, which are still present. Right lung remains clear. Moderate size left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The Dobbhoff ends in the upper stomach. Left-sided central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction. Chest tube projects over the left hemithorax.
