Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated somewhat to the right. Tracheostomy tube is again seen. There is right mid to lower lung opacity which appears decreased since the prior study but persists, which could be due to underlying infection and/or aspiration. There is also blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which may be due to a pleural effusion. There is a nodular opacity projecting over the left lower hemithorax, which likely represents nipple shadow. The aorta remains tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. There is mild left base atelectasis.
