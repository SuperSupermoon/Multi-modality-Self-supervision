Interval placement of a feeding tube which projects over the stomach but loops back with the tip positioned at the level of the esophagogastric junction. Repositioning would be advised. The right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position with the tip in the distal SVC. Faint bibasilar opacities persist which could reflect bibasilar atelectasis, although early pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
