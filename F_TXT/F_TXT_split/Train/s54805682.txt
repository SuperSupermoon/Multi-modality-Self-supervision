Portable AP image of the chest. There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube which crosses the right lung base and impinges on the mediastinum. Haziness is seen in the right upper lung, which has an convex margin inferiorly and may represent loculated pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. No dependent pleural fluid is seen. Opacities in the left lung base consistent with atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
