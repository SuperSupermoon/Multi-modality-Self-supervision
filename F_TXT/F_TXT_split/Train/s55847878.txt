The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles. The esophageal stent remains in place. Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. The small right pleural effusion has increased. Stable left retrocardiac airspace opacification is most likely due to atelectasis. Increased cysts right mid to lower lung airspace opacification is most likely due to aspiration. Mild pulmonary edema is new. A bandlike opacity in the left the mid lung is most likely due to linear atelectasis. There has been interval placement of a right main bronchus stent, which is faintly visible adjacent to the upper two sternotomy wires.
