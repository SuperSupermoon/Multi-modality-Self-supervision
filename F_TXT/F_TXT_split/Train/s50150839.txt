In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 2.7 cm above the carina. Extremely low lung volumes with continued atelectatic changes at the bases. Prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart and engorgement of the vascular pedicle in the mediastinum could well be a manifestation of the low lung volumes. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach.
