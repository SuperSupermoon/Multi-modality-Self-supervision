Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 04:40 a.m. Current study demonstrates cardiomegaly, moderate-to-severe and unchanged. Bilateral, right more than left pleural effusions are redemonstrated, potentially slightly increased in the interim. Hila are prominent with vascular engorgement but no overt pulmonary edema is seen. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Pleural effusion appears to be present in the left less than right costophrenic sulci but most likely bilateral.
