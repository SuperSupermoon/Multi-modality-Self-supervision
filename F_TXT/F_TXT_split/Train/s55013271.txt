Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.8 cm above the level of the carina. The enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not seen, does not course into the left upper quadrant; however, may still be within the GI tract. There is left lung base patchy opacity which raises concern for infection and/or pneumonia. No focal consolidation is seen in the right lung. There is possibly a small right upper lobe pulmonary nodule measuring approximately 4 mm which should be further assessed on dedicated chest CT or comparison with prior studies. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Given the patient is supine, there is not optimal evaluation for free air.
