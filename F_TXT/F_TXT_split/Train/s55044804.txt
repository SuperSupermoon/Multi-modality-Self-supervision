The left jugular line has been removed, and there is a new right-sided jugular line in adequate position that ends in the lower SVC. There is no pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube is at 5.8 cm above the carina. The side hole of the nasogastric tube is unchanged and still in the esophageal-gastric junction or slightly above it. It could be advanced. There is progression of the cephalization, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial markings compatible with moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. No pleural effusion.
