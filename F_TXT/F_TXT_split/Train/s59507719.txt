A right MediPort terminates in the low SVC. The lung volumes are exceedingly low, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, as a result of the extensive hepatic metastases, with overlying atelectasis. Asymmetric opacity throughout the left lung is noted. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are tiny, if any. Heart is normal size. The mediastinum is not widened. The stomach is moderately distended with air.
