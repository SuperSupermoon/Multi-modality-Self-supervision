As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. As expected, the lung volumes have slightly decreased, with resulting atelectasis at the right lung bases. However, further radiographic followup is required to exclude early pneumonia. No other relevant changes. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
