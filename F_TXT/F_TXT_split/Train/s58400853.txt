There has been placement of a new right-sided central venous line with the distal lead tip in the proximal right atrium. Rest of the lines and tubes appear unchanged in position. Heart size is grossly within normal limits. There has been improvement of the bilateral parenchymal opacities since the prior study. There has likely been some improvement of pulmonary interstitial edema. Chronic right proximal humerus fracture is again seen.
