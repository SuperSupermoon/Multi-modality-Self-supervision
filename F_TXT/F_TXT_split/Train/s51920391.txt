As compared to ___ radiograph, right chest tube remains in place. Previously present right apical pneumothorax is difficult to assess due to obscuration of the right lung apex related to flexed position of the patient's chin and neck. Repeat radiograph with improved positioning would be helpful in this regard. Small right pleural effusion has increased in size, and note is made of worsening atelectasis adjacent to the minor fissure and at both lung bases. Subcutaneous emphysema is present in the right chest wall.
