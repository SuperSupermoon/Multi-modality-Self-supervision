A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends in the mid trachea, 3.0 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube tip ends in the gastric fundus. Lung volumes are very low resulting in bronchovascular crowding. There is mild left basilar atelectasis. No large pneumothorax or effusion. Widening of the mediastinal silhouette is probably due to patient position and technique.
