Moderate residual loculated left pleural effusion slightly smaller, left basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter unchanged in position. Extent of consolidation in the left lung is still considerable. Solitary right lung lesion is slightly smaller. Obscuration of the left heart border makes cardiac assessment difficult but the heart is not grossly enlarged. There is no pulmonary edema and no pneumothorax.
