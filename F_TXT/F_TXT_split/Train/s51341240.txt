AP chest compared to ___: Right subclavian line still ends in the mid-to-low SVC. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is more pronounced and mediastinal veins more dilated, perhaps a reflection of supine positioning. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged, but there is no pulmonary edema or large pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
