Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of a pigtail right-sided chest catheter with subsequent re-expansion of the right lung and significant reduction in the right pneumothorax which is now small. Right mid to lower lung atelectasis is seen. There may be a small right pleural effusion. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which may be due to underlying right base and/or right middle lobe collapse. The left lung is clear. There is no left pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax on the left. The mediastinal silhouette is more wide as compared to the prior study but likely relates to AP portable technique, change in patient position and lower lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. VP shunt is again partially imaged projecting over the right hemithorax.
