In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pacer devices in place. Retrocardiac opacification with obliteration of the hemidiaphragms consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. At the right base, there is some patchy area of increased opacification. It is unclear whether this could represent some asymmetric pulmonary edema or a developing consolidation, especially since the upper part of the right heart border is not sharply seen.
