The endotracheal tube terminates in the proximal right mainstem bronchus. The right internal jugular catheter is unchanged in position and the tip is in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Otherwise, there are no significant changes compared to the prior radiograph performed earlier this morning. Again noted are diffuse bilateral patchy opacities similar in appearance compared to the prior radiograph performed earlier this morning, likely due to underlying Legionella infection.
