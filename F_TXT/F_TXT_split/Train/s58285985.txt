Right IJ central venous catheter with the catheter tip at the superior cavoatrial junction. Again noted are relatively stable bilateral opacities in the mid-to-lower lung fields which are suggestive of mild to moderate pulmonary edema. There are bilateral small pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. Heart size remains normal and mediastinal veins continue to be dilated. There is no pneumothorax.
