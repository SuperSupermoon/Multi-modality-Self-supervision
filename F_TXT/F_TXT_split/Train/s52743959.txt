Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is diffusely calcified. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema is present. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. Hazy opacification in the retrocardiac region may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. There is likely a moderate hiatal hernia. Biapical scarring with calcifications is present. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
