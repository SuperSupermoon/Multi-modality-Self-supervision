Residual right lung is better inflated following right upper lobectomy and the persistent apical pleural space is smaller and now nearly filled with fluid, overall a normal postoperative appearance. The arteries in both hila are mildly engorged and the heart though top normal size is larger compared with ___. New generalized interstitial abnormality is mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Greater opacification in the right lower lobe is probably a combination of dependent, asymmetric edema and atelectasis, but should be monitored after the patient's hemodynamic status improves to exclude concurrent pneumonia.
