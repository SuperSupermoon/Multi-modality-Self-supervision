A right internal jugular central venous catheter is seen with the tip terminating in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. In comparison to the most recent prior study, there is slightly increased opacification at the left lung base with blunting at the left costophrenic angle likely reflecting a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis. Streaky opacification at the right lung base medially most likely reflects atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits with calcification of the aortic knob and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present without overt pulmonary edema. Degenerative changes are noted in the spine. Two orthopedic screws are imaged in the right humeral head.
