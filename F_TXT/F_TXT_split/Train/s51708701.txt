Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 2.7 cm from the carina. Low lung volumes are noted with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings. Blunting of the left lateral costophrenic angle could also be secondary to atelectasis although underlying consolidation is possible. Within the limitation of overlying trauma board and external hardware there is no confluent consolidation.
