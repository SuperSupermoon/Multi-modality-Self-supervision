Lung volumes are low. Diffuse interstitial changes with honeycombing, predominating the lower lung zones, are better seen on the recent chest CT. There is superimposed mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. The heart size is difficult to assess given the diffuse parenchymal abnormalities. No pneumothorax.
