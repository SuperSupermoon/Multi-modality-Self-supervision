AP chest compared to ___: There is probably a small amount of right pleural air at the lateral, medial, and basal pleural surfaces of the right lung, but the change is minimal since earlier on ___ when a right basal chest tube was still in place. Small loculated right pleural effusion, partially fissural, looks smaller. Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are unchanging. Transvenous pacer defibrillator leads unchanged in their respective positions. An epidural infusion catheter appears to be in place still.
