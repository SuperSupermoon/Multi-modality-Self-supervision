As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, a left apical pneumothorax is identified with air extending adjacent to the medial portion of the lung. There is no pneumomediastinum. Bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions are noted. Support and monitoring devices are in unchanged position. There is air above the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with free intraperitoneal air and likely related to recent surgery.
