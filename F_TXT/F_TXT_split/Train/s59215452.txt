Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. Midline sternotomy wires, prosthetic cardiac valves, bilateral pacer PACS are again noted. The heart remains enlarged and there are bilateral pleural effusions which appear small-to-moderate in size. A poorly defined consolidation is noted in the right mid lung which could represent prominent bronchovasculature given patient's rotation to the right. Mild pulmonary edema is likely present. Calcification in the left upper quadrant corresponds to a known splenic calcification.
