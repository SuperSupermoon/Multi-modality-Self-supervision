Assessment is limited by lordotic positioning. Low lung volumes are present. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified. Known rib fractures are not clearly visualized on the current radiograph.
