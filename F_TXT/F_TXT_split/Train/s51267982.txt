The severe widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality disseminated throughout severely emphysematous lungs , developed since the end of ___, and has not improved over the past several days. The apex of the postoperative right lower lobe is the most hyperinflated region in severely emphysematous lungs, following upper lobectomy. The loculated right apical pleural effusion is chronic postoperatively. No pneumothorax is present. . It would be very unusual for aspiration a lung to produce this uniform and widespread a change in such severe emphysema. Aspiration could be contributory of course, but Instead I would consider pneumocystis pneumonia or severe pulmonary drug toxicity. The presence of small dependent pleural effusions is nonspecific, given the severity of the pulmonary abnormality. The heart is probably normal size. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.
