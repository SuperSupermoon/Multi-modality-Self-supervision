Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained on ___ at 3:20 p.m. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is re-demonstrated, most likely consistent with pulmonary hypertension. There is no substantial interval change in mild vascular engorgement to suggest interval progression of pulmonary edema. Bibasal opacities are re-demonstrated and might be consistent with areas of atelectasis. Of note that this study neither exclude nor confirm pulmonary embolism and if clinically warranted, assessment with CT of the chest might be considered.
