Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position. Stable cardiomegaly, but no evidence of pulmonary edema. Hazy opacities within the lower lungs may reflect partially layering pleural effusions on the semi-upright study, but superimposed soft tissues of the chest wall could potentially mimic an effusion on the right. Adjacent left retrocardiac opacity is likely due to atelectasis.
