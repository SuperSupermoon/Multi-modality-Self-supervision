Compared to two hours prior there is interval placement of a right pigtail catheter with tip projecting over the right diaphragmatic surface and is in appropriate position. Significant decrease in right pleural effusion with persistent veil-like opacity in the right lung suggesting small to moderate pleural effusion. Heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lobe superior to the minor fissure likely represents layering residual pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. No mediastinal shift. The left lung is unchanged with small area of linear atelectasis. Partially visualized heart size and mediastinal contours are normal. Hilar contours are normal. Unchanged right Port-A-Cath projecting over the right chest wall with tip in the low SVC. Bony structures are unremarkable.
