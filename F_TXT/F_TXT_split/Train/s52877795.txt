AP portable upright view of the chest. Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted as well as surgical clips projecting over the upper abdomen. Evaluation is somewhat limited due to subtle motion artifact on the single view provided. Allowing for this, volumes are low though the imaged portions of the lungs appear clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unchanged. Bony structures are intact.
