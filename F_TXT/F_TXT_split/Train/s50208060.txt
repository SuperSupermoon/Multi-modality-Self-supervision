Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is too low, 18 mm above the carina and should be pulled back at least 2 cm. The NG tube tip is at the gastroesophageal junction with the sidehole being in the distal esophagus and should be advanced. Heart size and mediastinum are grossly stable, but there is interval development of left lower lobe atelectasis and left mediastinal shift. Bilateral pleural effusions appear to be increased and there is also interval development of the interstitial prominence, concerning for pulmonary edema. Potential intra-abdominal devices projecting over the upper abdomen are partially imaged. The extreme lucency in the upper lungs and distortion of the lung parenchyma is most likely in consistency with emphysema. Intraperitoneal air is partially seen on the current study.
