Portable AP semi upright chest radiograph was provided. There is mild pulmonary interstitial edema with small bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's chin partially obscures the lung apices though no definite pneumothorax is seen. Heart size is difficult to assess. The mediastinal contour is overall stable with atherosclerotic calcifications involving the thoracic aorta. The imaged osseous structures appear grossly intact.
