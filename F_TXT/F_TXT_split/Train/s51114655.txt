1. Endotracheal tube has its tip 3.5-4 cm above the carina. There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube which is coiled within the stomach. Patchy airspace disease at the right lung base is concerning for aspiration and/or pneumonia. There also appears to be patchy retrocardiac airspace disease. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits, although the left ventricle is prominent suggesting left ventricular hypertrophy. No acute bony abnormality.
