Again seen is the endotracheal tube with tip above the carina, NG tube with tip coiled in the stomach, a Swan-___ catheter with tip in the right main pulmonary artery, a right subclavian PICC line with tip in the lower SVC, and a battery pack in the left chest wall with leads coursing superiorly towards the head. There is interval removal of the right central venous catheter and interval placement of ___ ___ catheter with tip extending beyond the diaphragm and beyond the inferior margin the film. There is volume loss in the left lower lobe consistent with collapse of the left lower lobe. There is also pulmonary congestion bilaterally. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
