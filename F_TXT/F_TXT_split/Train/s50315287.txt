Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier. There is no event pneumothorax. Small right effusion has decreased. Small-to-moderate left effusion is probably unchanged allowing difference in positioning of the patient. Bibasilar opacities larger on the left side are consistent with atelectasis. The patient has known emphysema and rib fractures. Left basal chest tube is in place.
