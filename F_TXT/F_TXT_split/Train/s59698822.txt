The dense right upper lobe consolidation has resolved in the interim. There are bilateral diffuse hazy opacities which may be due to a combination of atelectasis, pulmonary edema, although in the setting of trauma, pulmonary contusion cannot be excluded. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The endotracheal tube is situated in appropriate position 3 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is also visualized with the tip coursing out of the field of view of this exam. Osseous structures are grossly intact.
