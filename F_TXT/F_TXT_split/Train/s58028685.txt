1. Interval removal of the nasogastric tube with placement of the Dobbhoff feeding tube which has its tip within the stomach. Endotracheal tube remains in place with its tip 4.5 cm above the carina. Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC unchanged. Spinal fusion hardware overlies the mid to lower thoracic spine. Heart remains enlarged and the mediastinum appears widened but unchanged likely related to relatively low lung volumes and portable technique. There is diffuse bilateral airspace process with more consolidative component at the left base essentially unchanged but may reflect moderate pulmonary edema or diffuse pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax is seen.
