Small biapical pneumothoraces have slightly decreased in size, and remain larger on the left than the right side. Exam otherwise appears relatively similar to the recent study except for slight worsening of bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, and increase of a moderate left pleural effusion, aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has slightly increased in size, and a small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
