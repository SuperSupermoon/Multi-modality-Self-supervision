Comparison is made to prior study ___. Right lower lobe opacity has worsened consistent with increasing atelectasis and small effusion. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacities are grossly unchanged in combination of small pleural effusion and atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the left as before. Widened mediastinum due to an enlarged thyroid is unchanged. ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
