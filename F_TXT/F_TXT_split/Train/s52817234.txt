Lungs are hyperinflated. Right basilar opacity is compatible with right lower lobe atelectasis and small effusion. Spiculated left lower lung mass is again noted. Right apical nodular density is also as on prior. The lungs are otherwise clear without new focal consolidation. Skin fold projects over the left lateral thoracic cavity mimicking a pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities. Calcific density inferior to the left glenohumeral joint suggests intra-articular body.
