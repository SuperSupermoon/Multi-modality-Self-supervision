The previously seen right apical pneumothorax is much smaller or completely resolved. Possibility of a very small residual pneumothorax would be difficult to exclude given lordotic positioning. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is right focal consolidation focal opacity in the right mid/lower zones consistent with focal consolidation and a right-sided chest tube. Cardiomegaly is similar to prior.
