Lung volumes are low suggesting that band like opacity at both lung bases is atelectasis, but that could be due to aspiration, so follow up for pneumonia is indicated. Lower lung volume exaggerates the profusion of interstitial markings and vascularity, but there could be early edema. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Significant atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob are present.
