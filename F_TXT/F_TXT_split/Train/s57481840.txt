A single portable frontal supine view of the chest was obtained. Previously noted pigtail catheter in the left lateral chest wall has been removed with interval placement of a chest tube directed towards the left apex with reexpansion of the left lung. Increased opacification at the left base likely reflect atelectasis. Streaky atelectatic changes involving the right base are unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is no large effusion. The patient is now status post endotracheal tube placement, terminating approximately 4 cm above the carina in adequate position. NG tube is subdiaphragmatic but the exact location of the tip is not visualized.
