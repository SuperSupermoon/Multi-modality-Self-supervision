AP chest compared to ___: Right PICC line has been withdrawn slightly, now with the tip projecting over the head of the right clavicle, now at the origin of the right brachiocephalic vein. Previous interstitial edema, and mediastinal vascular engorgement have resolved, but new opacification at the base of the left lung could be due to substantial left lower lobe atelectasis, in addition to at least a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. Heart size is normal.
