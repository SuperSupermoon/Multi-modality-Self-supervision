Single AP view of the chest was reviewed. The heart size is top normal. There is no concerning mediastinal widening. The hila are unremarkable. Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is likely due to a small effusion with atelectasis. There are displaced fractures of right middle ribs laterally with local pleural or extrapleural bleeding, and fractures of indeterminate chronicity of left third posteriorly, and seventh and eighth ribs posterolaterally, also with local bleeding or pleural thickening. There is no pneumothorax or layering hemothorax. There is no focal consolidation in the right lung; consolidation, left lower lobe, probably atelectasis, chronicity indeterminate, is partially obscured by the heart. Median sternotomy wires and aortic valve replacement are present. There is no free air under the diaphragm. Spine is scoliotic, but not evaluated by this study.
