Low lung volumes accentuates the size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The heart size appears at least mildly enlarged. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Assessment of the lung bases, particularly the left lung base, is limited due to the presence of low lung volumes and exclusion of the left costophrenic angle. Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No right-sided pleural effusion is visualized. There is no pneumothorax.
