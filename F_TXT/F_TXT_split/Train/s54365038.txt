New nasogastric drainage tube ends distally in the right bronchial tree in the lower middle lobe bronchus. ET tube is in standard placement. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump below the lower margin of the left main bronchus is approximately 7 cm from the apex of the aortic valve.

No pneumothorax.
