Compared with the film from earlier the same day, I doubt significant interval change. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable. Left-sided 3 lead pacemaker type device is present, similar to the prior study. Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, possibly slightly improved. Also again seen is a left chest tube. No obvious pneumothorax or gross effusion is detected. Subcutaneous emphysema along the lower left chest wall is again noted. There is atelectasis and/or vascular plethora in the left upper lung, similar to the prior study. Right infrahilar atelectasis is unchanged. No gross right effusion.
