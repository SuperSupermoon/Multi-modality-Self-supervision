Compared with ___, there may have been slight interval increase in the opacity at the left lung base. A small left effusion is again seen. On today's exam, the right pleural effusion may also be slightly smaller. Otherwise, I doubt significant change. No CHF or other areas of infiltrate identified. Sternotomy wires, background cardiomegaly, and background hyperinflation are again noted.
