Left pleural effusion has reaccumulated and is now moderate in size, but still smaller than on the pre-thoracentesis radiograph of ___. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema. Bilateral pulmonary nodules are present consistent with known history of metastatic disease, as well as a dominant lingular mass which is partially obscured by the pleural effusion. Small right pleural effusion is not appreciably changed, but a peripheral area of parenchymal opacity at the right lung base has improved.
