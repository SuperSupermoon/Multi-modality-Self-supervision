Comparison is made with prior study ___. Severe cardiomegaly is stable. Transvenous pacer leads are in standard position. Swan-Ganz catheter remains in the distal right pulmonary artery and should be withdrawn approximately 4 cm for a more standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right lower lobe opacities are combination of increasing atelectasis and small-to-moderate effusion. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged.
