In comparison with the study of ___, there again are somewhat low lung volumes. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuous aorta but less widening of the superior mediastinum. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Streaks of atelectasis are seen at both bases. There are several suggested coalescent areas of opacification in the right lung an infrahilar region, though they do not appear as prominent as on prior studies. No "Wedge shaped opacity " is appreciated.
