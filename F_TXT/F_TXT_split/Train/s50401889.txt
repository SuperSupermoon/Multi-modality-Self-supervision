Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam, accentuating degree of cardiomegaly which is not changed since prior. Multiple abandoned epicardial leads and right-sided vascular stents are again noted. There is no definite focal consolidation. Increased interstitial markings are likely accentuated by AP technique and lower lung volumes. No large effusion. Radiopaque coil projects over the left axilla. No acute osseous abnormalities.
