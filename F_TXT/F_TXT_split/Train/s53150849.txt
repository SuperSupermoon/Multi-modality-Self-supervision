Compared to the prior film, increased retrocardiac opacity has improved somewhat, with renewed visualization of the left hemidiaphragm. Residual opacity remains present. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is marked cardiomegaly, with unfolding of the aorta, Upper zone redistribution with mild vascular engorgement is unchanged. Patchy opacity at the right base medially is similar to the prior film. Minimal , if any, left pleural fluid. No gross right effusion. No pneumothorax detected. Note is made of surgical clips about the trachea bilaterally at the level of thoracic inlet.
