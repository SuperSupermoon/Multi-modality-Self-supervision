As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. As a consequence, there is an increase in density at both lung bases, caused by vascular and bronchial crowding. The appearance of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. The monitoring and support devices are constant. No pneumothorax. No larger pleural effusions.
