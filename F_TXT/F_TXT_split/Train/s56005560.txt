A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates intact sternotomy wires and a radiopaque focus projecting over the SVC, unchanged. Cardiac size remains top-normal to mildly enlarged. There is again bibasilar atelectasis, but no confluent consolidation. There is mild vascular plethora without overt CHF. Overall, the appearance is similar to the prior study. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
