New right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the upper right atrium/cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. There is slightly increased opacity at the right lung base, which could be due to atelectasis, but aspiration or infection not excluded. Blunting of the costophrenic angles is again seen. The heart is top normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
