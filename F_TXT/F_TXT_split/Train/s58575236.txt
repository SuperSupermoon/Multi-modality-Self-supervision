Since the prior CXR, patient underwent bronchoscopy with interval resolution of right lower lobe collapse. There is still opacification of the right lung base, which is due to a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion. Additionally, the left costophrenic angle now appears blunted. No pneumothorax. The support devices including the right IJ introducer, ETT, enteric tube, left IJ catheter, and RUQ drain are unchanged.
