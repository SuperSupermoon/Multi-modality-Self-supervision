The heart is mildly enlarged. Lung volumes are low, causing crowding of bronchovascular structures. Patchy opacities in the bilateral lower lungs may be due to atelectasis, aspiration, or infection, in the appropriate clinical setting. Apical nodularity in the right upper lung is unchanged since ___ and therefore benign. Prominence of the right heart border is in keeping with the known ascending aortic aneurysm. No new focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusions are identified.
