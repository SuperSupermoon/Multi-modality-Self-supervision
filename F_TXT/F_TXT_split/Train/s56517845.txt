The ET tube terminates approximately 7 cm above the carina. Enteric tube is seen coursing to the lower hemithorax near the midline, with the tip out of view of this film. Mild cardiomegaly is overall stable compared to the prior exam. Low lung volumes appears to exaggerate the perihilar vascular structures, however aside from mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, the hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Along the right heart border in the mid right lung, there is a focal opacity, which appears new compared to the prior exam. Small bilateral pleural effusions are new. Note is made of mild bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
