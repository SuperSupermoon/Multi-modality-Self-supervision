The heart is again mildly enlarged but difficult to visualize on this film in its entirety. The aortic arch is again calcified. The lung volumes are low. Patchy perihilar opacification with indistinct pulmonary vascularity suggests mild vascular congestion or fluid overload. Otherwise, the examination is limited. It is difficult to exclude pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Similar moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is noted. Prominent lucency beneath the right hemidiaphragm appears very similar and is likely to reflect colonic interposition noting that the appearance is basically unchanged. There is a mildly prominent gas distended segment of bowel projecting over the right upper quadrant, potentially small bowel.
