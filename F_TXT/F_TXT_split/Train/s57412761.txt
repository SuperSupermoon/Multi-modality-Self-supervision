In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed. There is still enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with no evidence of increased pulmonary venous pressure. An area of increased opacification in the right upper zone persists. Although, this could merely reflect apical pulmonary edema, the asymmetry raises the possibility of supervening pneumonia. Retrocardiac opacification with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Blunting of both costophrenic angles is seen, suggestive of small pleural effusion.
