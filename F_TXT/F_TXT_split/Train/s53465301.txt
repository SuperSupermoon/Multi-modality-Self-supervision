AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained. The heart is moderately enlarged. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No definite signs of pneumonia. No overt signs of CHF. There is mild prominence of the aortic knob, but this is likely due to tortuosity with faint atherosclerotic calcifications noted. Bony structures are intact.
