1. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm and the tip projects over the expected location of the stomach. Interval placement of an endotracheal tube which has its tip 2.7 cm above the carina. Left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the proximal-to-mid superior vena cava. Left basilar pigtail catheter remains unchanged in position. 2. Status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac enlargement. There is a layering right pleural effusion. Interval improvement in aeration of the lungs but no evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax, particularly at the left apex. Right basilar linear opacity likely reflects residual patchy lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of a pleural effusion.
