Heart size remains top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes and bullas again noted, most pronounced in the right apex. Aeration of the lung bases has improved compared to the previous exam, with minimal residual streaky opacities suggestive of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.
