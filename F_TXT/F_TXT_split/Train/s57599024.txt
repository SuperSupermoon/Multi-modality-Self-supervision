In comparison to the prior study, the right lower lobe opacities have actually improved. Minimal left lower lobe opacities remain, probably consistent with atelectasis versus aspiration. Cardiac size is stable and normal. Aorta is slightly unfolded. Hilar contours are normal. No pleural effusion and no evidence of pneumonia. Hyperinflation corresponds to emphysema.
