As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position. There is unchanged looping of the nasogastric tube, projecting over the neck. Clinical correlation should make sure that the loop of the device is outside the thorax and not in an intrapharyngeal location. Unchanged mild bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right, unchanged areas of basal atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly that has not increased since the previous examination. No evidence of pneumothorax.
