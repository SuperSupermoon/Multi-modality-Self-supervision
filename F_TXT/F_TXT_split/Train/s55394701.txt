Large right pleural effusion which developed between ___ and ___ has increased slightly. Left lower lobe opacification could be atelectasis alone but pneumonia would be radiographically indistinguishable. Small left pleural effusion is likely. Heart is large but precise size is indeterminate because the right heart border is obscured by effusion. Transvenous right ventricular and left ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective positions. There is no pneumothorax. Indentation in the left wall of the trachea at the thoracic inlet is due in part to enlargement of the left thyroid lobe.
