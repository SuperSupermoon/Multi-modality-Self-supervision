Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior study. There is no pneumothorax. New diffuse hazy opacity in the right upper-to-mid lung around the area of biopsy is likely due to hemorrhage related to the procedure. The heart and mediastinal contours are normal, and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion. The bones and soft tissues are unremarkable. A catheter extends from the neck into the abdomen and is most likely a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
