Postoperative appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Hilar contours are normal. There is relative horizontal orientation of the tracheostomy tube which is otherwise in adequate position. Tracheal cuff appears to be inflated to a greater diameter than the trachea. A calcified nodule at the right lung base is unchanged and corresponds to granuloma on prior CT. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
