Since the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, asymmetrically distributed bilateral perihilar and basilar airspace opacities have developed, more severe on the right than the left, probably representing asymmetrical edema in the setting of worsening pulmonary vascular congestion, mediastinal pedicle widening, diffuse interstitial opacities and increasing moderate sized right pleural effusion. Coexisting secondary process in the right lower lung such as aspiration, hemorrhage or infection is less likely but not excluded radiographically.
