Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Mild upper zone vascular redistribution suggests mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
