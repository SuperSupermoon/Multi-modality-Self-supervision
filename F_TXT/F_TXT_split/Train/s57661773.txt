Left-sided chest tube remains in place. A small lateral left pneumothorax has increased in size since the previous study. Moderate left pleural effusion is not appreciably changed. Right internal jugular vascular catheter has been removed in the interval and a right PICC is no longer visualized. There is no visible right pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Bibasilar atelectasis persists, and remainder of lungs are grossly clear.
