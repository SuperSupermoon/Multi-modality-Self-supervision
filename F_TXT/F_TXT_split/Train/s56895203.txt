Single portable view of the chest. Exam is limited secondary to body habitus and low inspiratory effort. However, when compared to prior, there is increased right basilar opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm suspicious for effusion. There are also hazy opacities in lungs suggesting pulmonary edema. There is no large left effusion. Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess as its right margin is not visualized.
