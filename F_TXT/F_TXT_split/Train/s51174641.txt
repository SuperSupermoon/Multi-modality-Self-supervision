A right internal jugular central line ends in the mid SVC. There is a new pleural effusion at the left base with associated atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion on the right. Again noted is mildly increased heart size and mildly increased diameter of the pulmonary vessels with mild pulmonary edema. This appears slightly improved from the prior study. There are no consolidations. There is no pneumothorax.
