A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph is obtained. Exam is limited by low lung volumes and portable technique. Increased hilar indistinctness and increased azygous distension suggest worsening pulmonary edema. Atelectasis at the left base is unchanged. Retrocardiac opacity is more conspicuous; the left hemidiaphragm is completely obscured.
