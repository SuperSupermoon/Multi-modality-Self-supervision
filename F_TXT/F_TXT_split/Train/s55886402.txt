Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiomegaly is stable. Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper SVC. Right PICC tip is difficult to evaluate, can be followed to the upper SVC. There is no evident pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are new on the right and probably stable on the left. Vascular congestion has improved. Retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis and pleural effusion is unchanged. The right lower lobe new opacity is a combination of small right pleural effusion and atelectasis. Sternal wires are aligned.
