Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. There is no evident pneumothorax. Bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis have improved. There is mild vascular congestion. There are low lung volumes. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper SVC. Mediastinal widening has improved. Cardiomegaly is obscured by lung abnormalities and accentuated by low lung volumes.
