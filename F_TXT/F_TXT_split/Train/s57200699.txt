There is moderate interstitial pulmonary edema as well as bilateral atelectasis, which is moderate on the left and mild on the right. There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is not significantly changed. The mediastinal contours are otherwise normal. There is redemonstration of a left Port-A-Cath, ending in the low SVC. Note is made of vertebroplasties along the thoracolumbar spine, as before.
