ET tube is 3.3 cm above the carina. NG tube ends below the diaphragm but distal end is not included in this study. Even with the presence of the NG tube, the stomach is still distended. Significant worsening of widespread lung opacities is probably explained by a mix of neurogenic edema and volume overload in this patient with intracranial bleeding. The cardiac contour is top normal. Mediastinum is slightly larger than the previous exam due to vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax. New left jugular line is in adequate position in the upper SVC.
