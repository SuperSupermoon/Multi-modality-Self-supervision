Prior chest radiograph shows severe pulmonary hyperinflation indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema and/or airway obstruction, and moderate cardiomegaly. Today the cardiomegaly is more severe and there is new pulmonary vascular congestion. There is also a very unusual new abnormality in the left upper lobe, consisting of very coarse, nearly confluent reticulation. This is either an extremely unusual instance of asymmetric nondependent pulmonary edema favoring the left upper lobe or large scale pneumonia or localized pulmonary hemorrhage. In any case the appearance is a function of a pulmonary abnormality on a scaffold of emphysema. Radiographic follow-up will be useful in distinguishing among these possibilities. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusion is small if any. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such abnormalities. If the the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
