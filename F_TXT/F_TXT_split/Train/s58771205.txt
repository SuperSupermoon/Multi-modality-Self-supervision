Over the last 24 hours, mild to moderately severe asymmetric pulmonary edema, predominantly involving the mid and lower lungs and right side more than left, has improved with predominant improvement appreciated on the left side. Residual opacities could be unresolved pulmonary edema; however, if any of this represents infection, cannot be determined based on radiograph alone and needs to be reviewed in conjunction with clinical history. Increased retrocardiac density may reflect atelectasis and/or consolidation and is similar. Mild to moderately enlarged heart size and probable small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Minimal calcification in the aortic arch is unchanged.
