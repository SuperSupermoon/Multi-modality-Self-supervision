In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. Other monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. There is again hazy opacification at the right base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion. Less prominent changes are seen on the left. It is difficult to assess whether there has been any change in the amount of pleural fluid, since the current study appears to be more supine than the previous one.
