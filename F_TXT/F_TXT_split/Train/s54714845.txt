Mildly hypoinflated lungs with perihilar interstitial prominence consistent with vascular crowding. Stable reticular opacities within the lungs. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Calcification of the left apical pleural surface again noted. No focal opacity. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable. Limited assessment of the osseous structures are unremarkable and upper abdomen is within normal limits.
