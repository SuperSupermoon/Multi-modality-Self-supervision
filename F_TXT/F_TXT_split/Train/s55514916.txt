Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy. There are low lung volumes and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. There is also hazy opacity of the right lung base and blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may be due to small pleural effusion with possible overlying atelectasis. Right perihilar opacity may relate to post-radiation change, although appears slightly more prominent as compared to the prior study and underlying vascular congestion or infection not excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
