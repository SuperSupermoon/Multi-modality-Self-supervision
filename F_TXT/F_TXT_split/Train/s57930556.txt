Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is a moderate-to-large left pneumothorax without definite tension. Left basilar opacities may be due to atelectasis/collapsed lung, although underlying consolidation due to pulmonary hemorrhage is not excluded in this clinical context. Right lung demonstrates low lung volumes without focal consolidation. No large pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No displaced fracture is identified.
