A right PICC line has been pulled back and now terminates in the low SVC. Moderate cardiomegaly and vascular congestion is unchanged. There is no frank pulmonary edema. The mediastinal contour is normal. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are larger. Retrocardiac opacity is likely a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. There is no apical pneumothorax.
