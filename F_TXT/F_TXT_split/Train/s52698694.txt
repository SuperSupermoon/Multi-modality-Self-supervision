Single frontal radiograph of the chest shows no interval changes of large left pleural effusion with complete collapse of left lower lobe. Stable minimal opacification on the right lung base is compatible with dependent edema. Right jugular Port-A-Cath is unchanged with tip ending at the atriocaval junction. Heart is probably enlarged but the contours are partially obscured by left pleural effusion.
