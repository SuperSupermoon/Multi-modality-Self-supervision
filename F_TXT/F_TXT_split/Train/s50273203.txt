AP chest compared to ___ 04:11 p.m.: Left subclavian line has been removed. Right subclavian line ends low in the SVC. ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placements. Left basal pleural tube remains sharply folded at the base of the left hemithorax and there might be a small basal pleural air collection. The right pleural tube is not completely imaged, but is unchanged in position and therefore the side port is still extrathoracic. There is no right pneumothorax or appreciable pleural fluid collection on either side, but there is opacity in the right lung around the tip of the right pleural tube which could be suction-induced contusion. Careful followup is advised. Lung volumes are lower today than before and therefore increasing bibasilar opacification could be explained by worsening atelectasis in regions of previous pulmonary contusion. Lower lung volumes also accounts for enlarging heart size, and greater distention of mediastinal veins. The presence of chest wall trauma is better evaluated by yesterday's torso CT.
