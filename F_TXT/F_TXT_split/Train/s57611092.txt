Numerous clips are again demonstrated in the region of the right hilum. There appears to be worsening volume loss within the right hemithorax due to right lower lobe collapse with rightward shift of mediastinal structures and increased elevation of right hemidiaphragm. Pleural thickening and nodularity along with right central adenopathy are better delineated on the recent CT. Multiple nodular opacities within the right lung compatible with metastases as well as osseous metastatic disease with right rib destruction are re- demonstrated. There is persistent right basilar patchy opacification, possibly atelectasis or infection. Left lung remains grossly clear without left-sided pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Thoracic spinal fusion hardware is again seen. A catheter device is seen projecting over the right hilum, which is external to the patient.
