Endotracheal tube terminates 3.8 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is seen entering the stomach and out of the field of view. A right upper extremity PICC projects 7.8 cm below the carina and would need to be withdrawn by 2 cm for positioning within the SVC, if desired. The apparent improvement in the widespread consolidations may relate to improved lung volumes, to some extent, in comparison to yesterday morning. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Heart size is mildly enlarged, slightly larger. No strong evidence for overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
