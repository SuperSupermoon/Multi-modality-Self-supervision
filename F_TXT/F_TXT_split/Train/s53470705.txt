Lungs are fully expanded and clear. Heart is chronically mildly enlarged, improved since prior studies. Mediastinal contours suggests a very large central pulmonary artery or alternatively a mass in the aortopulmonic window. Since descending pulmonary arteries are mildly enlarged this could be pulmonary hypertension alone. Chest CT scanning would be needed to make the distinction. ET tube in standard placement. Esophageal drainage tube ends in the upper portion of a nondistended stomach. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
