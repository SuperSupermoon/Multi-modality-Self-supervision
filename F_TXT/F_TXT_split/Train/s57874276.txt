In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. The tip appears to project directly facing the left wall of the trachea. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist. Again this could reflect widespread pneumonia with some component of pulmonary edema. Central catheter again extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
