Portable frontal chest radiographs demonstrate a tracheostomy tube and right PICC, unchanged in position. The heart remains moderately enlarged. Lung volumes are low, with bronchovascular crowding. The retrocardiac opacity is unchanged, but there is mildly increased pulmonary edema. There is likely a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable, except for an incompletely imaged PEG tube.
