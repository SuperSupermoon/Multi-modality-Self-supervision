As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The sternal wires after sternotomy are in constant alignment. Constant Port-A-Cath position in the right pectoral region. Unchanged mild blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, likely caused by a small pleural effusion, with an area of parenchymal opacity in the retrocardiac lung region, reflecting pneumonia or atelectasis. The extent of the change is constant as compared to the previous image. No pneumothorax. No other changes.
