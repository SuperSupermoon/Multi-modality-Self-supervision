Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates an ET tube extending approximately 5 mm into the proximal right main bronchus. The enteric tube extends into the region of the stomach with side port below the GE junction. An IVC filter is in expected location. Mildly prominent cardiac silhouette is accentuated by low lung volumes and AP technique. Mild mediastinal prominence is likely due to supine technique, although in the setting of trauma, vascular injury should be correlated with cross-sectional imaging. Mild atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aortic arch. Interstitial markings are prominent, likely due to crowding related to low lung volumes. Trace effusions cannot be excluded. There is mild irregularity along the anterolateral aspect of the left eighth and ninth ribs, to be correlated with focal tenderness.
