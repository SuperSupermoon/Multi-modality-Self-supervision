Limited assessment of cardiomediastinal silhouette due to low inspiratory volumes. The possibility of opacity about the left hilar region cannot be excluded. Allowing for technical differences, the appearance is similar to the film obtained at 2:11 a.m. the same day. There is opacity at right greater than left lung apices, similar to a chest CTA from one day earlier. However, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is less well-defined than the trauma films from ___. Clinical correlation is therefore requested.
