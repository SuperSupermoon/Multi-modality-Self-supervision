There are low inspiratory volumes. An ET tube is present, tip at the level of the midclavicular heads approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm overlying the gastric fundus. There is atelectasis at both lung bases. The possibility of a more focal opacity in the left perihilar region cannot be excluded. Prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissues is noted, likely accentuated by low lung volumes. No effusion is identified. No free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.
