AP view of the chest is reviewed. There is a right-sided chest tube with tip terminating in the lung apex. There is subcutaneous edema near the entry site of the chest tube. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which appears worsened compared to the prior study. There is a small right effusion with bibasilar opacities, more pronounced on the right. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. No pneumothorax grossly detected. No displaced fractures noted.
