Single semi-upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The left internal jugular central venous catheter is seen terminating at the SVC/brachiocephalic junction. If this is the same catheter that was present on ___, it is more proximal in position as compared to the prior study. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. There are low lung volumes. Obscuration of the diaphragms may be due to small pleural effusions and/or atelectasis. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggesting mild pulmonary edema. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
