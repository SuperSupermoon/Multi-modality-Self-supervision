This study is slightly limited due to lordotic positioning and slight rotation. The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta appears to be slightly unfolded. Perihilar and bibasilar airspace opacities are noted, which likely reflect mild pulmonary edema, worse in the interval. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions are present. No pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
