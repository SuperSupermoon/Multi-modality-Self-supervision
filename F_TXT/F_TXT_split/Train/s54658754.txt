Comparison is made to the previous study from ___. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 4.6 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. There is a right IJ central line with distal lead tip in the mid SVC. There is a nasogastric tube whose tip and side port are below GE junction. Heart size is within normal limits. There are again seen bilateral pleural effusions and a left retrocardiac opacity and mild pulmonary interstitial prominence. This is unchanged. No pneumothoraces are seen.
