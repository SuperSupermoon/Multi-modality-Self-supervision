As compared to previous radiograph from several hr earlier, a left-sided chest tube has been removed, with no evidence of apical pneumothorax. Small lucency adjacent to site of previous chest tube is again demonstrated as well as a small left pleural effusion and adjacent left retrocardiac atelectasis. Focal linear atelectasis at the right lung base is unchanged as well.
