Interval advancement of the nasogastric tube which now has its tip projecting in the stomach but the side port is at the gastroesophageal junction. The tube should be advanced in additional 8-10 cm. Left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the proximal right atrium 7 cm below the carina. Pull-back by 2 cm would place the tip in at the cavoatrial junction if this is clinically desired. Low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities favoring atelectasis. No obvious pneumothorax.
