Left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with a persistent moderate-sized left apicolateral pneumothorax. Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. Widespread bilateral parenchymal opacification is consistent with history of ARDS, and may be complicated by pulmonary interstitial emphysema. Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
