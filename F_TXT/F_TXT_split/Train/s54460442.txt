Mild cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and diffuse interstitial edema. Patchy opacities at the left lung base partially obscure the left hemidiaphragm and could be due to atelectasis or potentially a developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
