The cardio mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged in appearance. There are increased interstitial opacities bilaterally, however, there is an overall poor inspiratory effort and low lung volumes which limits interpretation, as this may simply be due to crowding of normal vascular structures. It is recommended to repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory effort for better visualization of lung parenchyma. There is loss of definition of the right lateral costophrenic angle which is likely due to small right pleural effusion. There are no pneumothoraces.
