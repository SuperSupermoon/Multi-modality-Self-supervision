Assessment is limited by kyphotic positioning and low lung volumes. Heart size appears mild to moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Mild atelectasis is noted in the lung bases. No large pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified however assessment of the lung apices is obscured by the patient's chin and neck projecting over this area. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
