Single portable view of the chest. No prior available for comparison. Endotracheal tube is seen with tip approximately 4 cm from the carina, in appropriate position. Right-sided PICC line is seen with tip in the right brachiocephalic vein, relatively close to the superior SVC. Enteric tube seen with tip off the inferior field of view and the sideport is seen below the GE junction. There is dense retrocardiac opacity identified silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, which could be due to any combination of effusion, atelectasis, or consolidation. The lungs are otherwise grossly clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is notable for median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips. Degenerative changes noted at the left shoulder with heterotopic ossification in the adjacent soft tissues.
