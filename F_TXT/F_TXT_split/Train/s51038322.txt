Inspiratory volumes are at the lower limits of normal or minimally diminished. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with sternotomy wires and multiple mediastinal clips noted. Again seen is curvilinear density adjacent to the right heart border question related to prior surgery. No CHF. Minimal atelectasis at both lung bases is probably slightly improved. The possibility of minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles cannot be excluded, but no gross pleural effusion is identified. Biapical pleural thickening is again noted, similar to the prior film. No pneumothorax is detected.
