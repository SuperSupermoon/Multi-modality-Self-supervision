As compared to the previous radiograph, the mediastinal drains and the bilateral chest tubes have been removed. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or larger pleural effusions. A lucent line paralleling the apical lateral left chest wall corresponds to the medial margin of the scapula. The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, Swan-Ganz catheter and aortic balloon pump are in unchanged location.
