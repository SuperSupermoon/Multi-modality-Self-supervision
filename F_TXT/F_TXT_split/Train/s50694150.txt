AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Tracheostomy tube has a relatively short intratracheal excursion and should be evaluated clinically to see if it is properly positioned. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved and small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, stable on the right and decreased on the left. Heart is moderately to severely enlarged though improved, as is mediastinal vascular engorgement. Left lower lobe is airless, presumably atelectasis. A feeding tube or catheter probe ends in the region of the pylorus. No pneumothorax.
