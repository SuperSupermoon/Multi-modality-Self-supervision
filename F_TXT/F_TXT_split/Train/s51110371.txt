In comparison with the study of ___, there is again one left chest tube in place with opacification at the left base most likely reflecting atelectasis and effusion, though superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Port-A-Cath position is unchanged. The left apical region is difficult to see due to overlying bony shadows. The possibility of a small pneumothorax would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting. Multiple metallic coils are seen in the left upper abdomen.
