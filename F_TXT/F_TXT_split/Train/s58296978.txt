Comparison is now with prior study performed at the earlier. There are lower lobe volumes. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. This could represent of pericardial effusion. Left apical chest tube is in place. There is no evident pneumothorax. Widening of mediastinum is partially due to engorged vessels. There is mild to moderate vascular congestion. Bibasilar atelectasis are larger on the right side.
