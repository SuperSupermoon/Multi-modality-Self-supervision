A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette, allowing for technique. The lungs are fairly well-aerated, with bilateral infrahilar opacities, which could represent multifocal pneumonia. The right infrahilar opacity is increased compared to the chest radiograph from earlier on the same day. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
