The tracheostomy tube now has its tip approximately 1.5 cm above the carinal. A right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC. A right neck vascular stent remains in position. Bilateral airspace opacities are again seen although it appears slightly more confluent in the right upper lobe on the current study. There is a layering left effusion and likely a small right effusion. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning. No pneumothorax is seen although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. No pulmonary edema. Multiple surgical clips are seen in the lower right axilla and in the right hilar vicinity in this patient status post recent reconstructive surgery.
