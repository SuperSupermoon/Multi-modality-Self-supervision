Multiple lines and tubes been removed. A right IJ catheter overlies the proximal SVC. Possibility of a tiny left apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded. No other evidence a pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged allowing for lower lung volumes. Of note, there is hazy opacity at the right base which raises the possibility of some layering pleural fluid. There is bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation which has progressed compared with the earlier study.
