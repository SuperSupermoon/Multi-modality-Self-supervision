The tracheostomy is in place. Inspiratory volumes remain low. Compared to the prior study, there is new patchy interstitial and alveolar opacity at the left lung base. No definite change at the right base, with there is a small amount of pleural fluid and/or thickening, tenting of the hemidiaphragm, and infrahilar patchy opacity. No definite CHF. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged, including thickening of the right paratracheal soft tissues, which appears confluent with dense pleural thickening or fluid at the right lung apex, as before. The right PICC line has been retracted. The tip now overlies the scapula, immediately outside the right lateral chest wall.
