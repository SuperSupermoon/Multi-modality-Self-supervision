The patient is status post median sternotomy, and multiple mediastinal surgical clips reflect prior thymoma resection. Streaky bilateral paramediastinal, predominately upper lobe, fibrotic changes are compatible with prior radiation treatment as seen on the prior CT, and there may be mild central vascular congestion. No pleural effusion is seen. No focal consolidation or overt pulmonary edema is noted. The heart is top-normal in size. No intra-abdominal free air is noted in the upper abdomen.
