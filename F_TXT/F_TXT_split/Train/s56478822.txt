A left basal consolidation and left pleural effusion appear to be slightly increased since the prior study. Small right pleural effusion is demonstrated. No pneumothorax is seen. No pulmonary edema is present. Overall the findings when compared to previous study demonstrate slight increase in the left basal consolidation and potential progression of right basal opacity that might explain oxygen requirement reported.
