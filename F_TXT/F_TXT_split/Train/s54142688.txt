Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a right-sided central line with distal lead tip in the distal SVC. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is atelectasis at the lung bases. However, the opacity at the right lung base is more apparent and may be due to developing infiltrate. Continued attention to this area is recommended on subsequent exams. There are no pneumothoraces.
