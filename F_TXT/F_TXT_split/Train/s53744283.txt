The positions of the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and pigtail catheter are unchanged. Increased opacities are seen in the right lung indicating fluid in the greater and lesser fissures. Left effusion is also present. Increased retrocardiac density is again noted, consistent with atelectasis, though pneumonia is not excluded in this region. Upper zone redistribution is still present.
