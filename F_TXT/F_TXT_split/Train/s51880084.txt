Assessment is limited due to positioning. Allowing for this limitation, the endotracheal tube ends at the level of the carina. The NG tube ends in the stomach but the side port is above the gastroesophageal junction. Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. However there are vague opacities at the right cardiophrenic angle as well as in the retrocardiac region. There may be a small left-sided pleural effusion. There is no right-sided pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified.
