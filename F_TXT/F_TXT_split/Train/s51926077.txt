AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 6:08 a.m.: Right subclavian central venous line ends low in the SVC, a dual-channel arterial line passes from the left subclavian position to the descending thoracic aorta, both are unchanged as to course and termination, since ___:08 a.m., but could have been repositioned. Despite bilateral pleural drains, a pigtail on the right and two large thoracostomy tubes on the left, at least small pneumothorax persists, and there is still quite severe pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema of the chest wall and neck. Heart size is normal. An upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Appearance of the lungs has not changed appreciably. There is still a region of consolidation in the axillary portion of the right upper lobe, presumably contusion or pneumonia. ET tube is in standard position.
