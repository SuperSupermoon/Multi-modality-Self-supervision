Compared with ___ at 13:00, the NG tube tip and side-port now overlie the gastric fundus. Again seen is a right-sided PICC line with tip overlying the right atrium. It may have been retracted compared with the most recent prior film, but continues to overlie the right atrium. Retraction by 3 cm could help for positioning in the distal SVC. Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.
