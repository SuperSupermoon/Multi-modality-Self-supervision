Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, nasogastric to and mediastinal and pleural tubes remain unchanged in position. Interval improvement but residual mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. Status post median sternotomy with expected postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Left basilar retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of small effusion. No obvious pneumothorax.
