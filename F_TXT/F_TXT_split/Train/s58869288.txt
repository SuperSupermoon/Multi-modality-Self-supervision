Single portable view of the chest. Tracheostomy tube is in place. Left-sided tunneled central venous dual-lumen catheter is seen with distal tip in the right atrium. There is at least a moderate right-sided pleural effusion which contributes due to increased opacity projecting over the right lung with superimposed infection also possible. There is some degree of pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged but likely accentuated by technique. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
