Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval placement of a endotracheal tube that terminates 2.7 cm above the carina. Enteric tube has been removed. Aortic stent is unchanged in position. There is the right lung base opacity, which may be due to pleural effusion and/or atelectasis, but pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Curvilinear opacity along the medial aspect of the right upper hemithorax represents wall of the persistently dilated esophagus. Left lung is essentially clear. No pneumothorax. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
