A right pigtail catheter has been placed in the interim with its tip projecting over the lateral aspect of the right lower hemithorax. The previously demonstrated large pleural effusion has subsequently decreased in size, now moderate. There is probably a large associated degree of relaxation atelectasis as the cardiomediastinal silhouette is shifted to the right. No evidence of pneumothorax. There is extensive air under the left hemidiaphragm which appears to lie within the stomach. No left pleural effusion. The left lung is clear.
