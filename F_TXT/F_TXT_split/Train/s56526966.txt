The ___ tube is again seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified but the balloon remaining inflated at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. The endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central lines are unchanged in position. There continues to be small to moderate layering effusions, right greater than left, but overall the mild interstitial pulmonary edema has improved. Patchy opacities at the lung bases most likely reflect compressive atelectasis. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax.
