The endotracheal tube is positioned high, approximately 7 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. The lung volumes are low. Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged. Since the prior exam, there has been a slight interval worsening of the vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema. There is no opacity to suggest pneumonia. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Widening of the mediastinal contours is unchanged, and likely due to mediastinal fat, as seen on the prior CT. The heart appears slightly larger.
