CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. Compared with ___ at 21:07 p.m., and allowing for technical differences, there may be some increased opacity at the right base. However, the right hemidiaphragm remains visible. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Diffuse bilateral opacities remain present. Suspect some layering fluid at the right base, with some loculated pleural fluid or thickening along the upper portions of the right lung. Again seen are a right IJ dual-lumen line, with tips over the proximal SVC, left subclavian central line with tip over mid SVC, sternotomy wires, clips, prosthetic cardiac valve, and thoracic aortic stent. Note is made that there is a second valve-like ring structure, overling the lower mediastinum, which has separated edges, stable over several recent films -- clinical correlation regarding this structure is requested.
