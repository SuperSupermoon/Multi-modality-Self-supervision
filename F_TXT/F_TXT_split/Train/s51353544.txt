There is still presence of substantial amount of contrast within the stomach and the esophagus (reflux?). Cardiac silhouette is unchanged including left retrocardiac consolidation. No definitive pneumothorax is seen. Subcutaneous air appears to be decreasing. Small amount of pleural effusion on the left is most likely present.
