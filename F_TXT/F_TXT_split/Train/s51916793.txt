Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. There is no change in the widespread parenchymal opacities with more focal abnormality seen in the right lower lung, potentially slightly increased, as well as the rest of the imaged portion of the chest. Heart size and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Pleural effusions are bilateral and better assessed on the CT obtained three days ago, most likely unchanged. No appreciable pneumothorax is demonstrated.
