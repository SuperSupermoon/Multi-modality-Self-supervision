Extensive interstitial lung disease and chronic airways disease appears similar to the prior radiograph. A mass with a fiducial in the right lower lobe is stable in appearance, however, the surrounding opacification appears improved. Right upper lung calcified lesion on prior CT is also grossly unchanged. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is no new focal opacity concerning for pneumonia. Slight blunting of the costophrenic angles may relate to tiny pleural effusions or pleural scarring. No pneumothorax is identified.
