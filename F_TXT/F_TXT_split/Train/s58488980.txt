Assessment is limited by patient positioning and the patient's chin and neck obscure evaluation of the medial aspect of the upper lobes. Given these limitations, the heart size remains mildly enlarged. Extensive esophageal varices account for the abnormally widened lower mediastinal contour which appears grossly unchanged. Lung volumes are low. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or large pneumothorax is demonstrated. Multiple calcified gallstones are again noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
