Since ___, there has been interval placement of an ET tube, which terminates 4.7 cm above the carina, and an enteric tube, which coils at the GE junction and ascends within the esophagus to the level of the clavicles. The previously identified large hiatal hernia is not identified on this examination due to a combination of moderate left pleural effusion and associated compressive atelectasis. Heart and mediastinum appear mildly enlarged and there is mild pulmonary edema, which may be exaggerated by overall low lung volumes.
