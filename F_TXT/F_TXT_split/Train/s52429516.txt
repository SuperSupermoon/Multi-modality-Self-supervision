AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Heart size and mediastinum appear to be grossly unchanged, including the right mediastinal shift, most likely due to partial element of atelectasis/scarring in the right lower lobe. Small amount of right pleural effusion is demonstrated. No pneumothorax is seen.
