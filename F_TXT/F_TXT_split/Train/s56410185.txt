AP chest compared to earlier on ___: Feeding tube ends in the lower esophagus and would need to be advanced at least 10 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. Heart is mildly enlarged, pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature are engorged, all suggesting volume overload, though I doubt that pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion is present. Right jugular line ends in the upper mid SVC.
