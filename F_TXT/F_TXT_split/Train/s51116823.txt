Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. A right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, terminating at the right atrium. There are relatively low lung volumes. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle and right basal opacity suggests pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded. Small pulmonary nodules seen on prior CTs are better evaluated on CT. There is slight prominence of the interstitium which may be due to minimal interstitial edema. No left pleural effusion is seen. Cardiac silhouette is top normal. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.
