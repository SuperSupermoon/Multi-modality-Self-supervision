Endotracheal tube tip is 3.9 cm above the carina and orogastric tube ends into the stomach, appropriately positioned. There are no interval changes in the lungs since the prior radiograph acquired 10 hours apart. Minimal opacity in the right lung base, probably atelectasis, is similar. No new discrete or confluent opacities of concern. Mildly enlarged heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusions if any are small bilaterally and stable.
