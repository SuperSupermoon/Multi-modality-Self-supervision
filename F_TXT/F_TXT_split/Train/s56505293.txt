As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no evidence of pneumothorax after insertion of a right pleural pigtail catheter. Small right pleural effusion could be slightly decreased in extent. The massive confluent opacities in the right lung have minimally decreased in extent and severity. The basal opacities, however, are overall unchanged. Slight increase in size of the cardiac silhouette.
