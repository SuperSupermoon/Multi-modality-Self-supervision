Portable AP upright chest radiograph shows a right hilar/ infrahilar mass and bilateral streaky bibasilar consolidation with an appearance suggesting subsegmental atelectasis. On the right this involves the middle lobe and a radiodense, well-expanded stent is identified overlying the middle lobe bronchus. No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is seen. Calcified atherosclerotic plaque is seen in the arch of the thoracic aorta.
