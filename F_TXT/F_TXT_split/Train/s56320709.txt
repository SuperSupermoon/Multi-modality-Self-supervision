AP chest compared to ___. Moderate-to-severe cardiac enlargement has not improved, and pulmonary vasculature is still engorged in the upper lobes, indicating cardiac dysfunction. I do not see edema in the upper lobes and lower lobes are hard to assess because of overlying soft tissue. There is at least a small if not moderate right pleural effusion and perhaps a small left pleural effusion, neither of which is new. There is no pneumothorax.
