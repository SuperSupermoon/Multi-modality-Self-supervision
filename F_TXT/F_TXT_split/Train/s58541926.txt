A nasogastric tube has been placed which makes a single coil within the stomach. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged, allowing for differences in technique. The heart is at the upper limits of normal size. The lung volumes appear low. The lungs appear clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No free air is demonstrated. Degenerative changes involve each shoulder. The right acromiohumeral interval appears narrowed which can be seen with rotator cuff pathology, and suture anchors in the left humeral head suggest prior rotator cuff repair, also present before.
