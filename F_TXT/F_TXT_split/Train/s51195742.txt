Frontal portable chest radiographs demonstrate a central catheter which is unchanged in position, terminating in the left brachiocephalic vein, as well as a nasogastric tube with the tip within the stomach. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Opacity of the right lower lobe likely represents collapse, but underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is also a possible small right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax or bony abnormality is seen.
