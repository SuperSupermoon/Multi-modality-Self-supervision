As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been no significant change. The extent and severity of pre-existing bilateral right basal and left perihilar parenchymal opacities remain unchanged. The morphology and location of these opacities suggest a combination of pulmonary edema and/or pneumonia. Cardiomegaly is stable. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Monitoring and support devices remain in unchanged position.
