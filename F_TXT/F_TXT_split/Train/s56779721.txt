In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, there is now visible a small amount of aerated lung in the left mid lung region in this patient who previously demonstrated complete left lung collapse. A majority of the left lung remains atelectatic, likely due to mucous plugging. Associated pleural effusion is difficult to quantify in the setting of extensive atelectasis. Within the right lung, new subsegmental atelectasis has developed at the lung base.
