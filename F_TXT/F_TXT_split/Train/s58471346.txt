In comparison with the study of ___, of the monitoring and support devices remain in place. There is again evidence of increased pulmonary venous pressure without definite cardiomegaly. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and there is blunting of the costophrenic angle consistent with small pleural effusion. On the right, there are areas of increased opacification in the mid and lower lungs with poor definition of the lateral aspect of the hemidiaphragm. Although this could merely represent atelectasis and a small pleural effusion. The extent of this process is strongly suggestive of aspiration or infectious pneumonia if this is consistent with the clinical history.
