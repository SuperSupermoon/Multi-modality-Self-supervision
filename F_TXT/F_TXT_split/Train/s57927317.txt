Since prior radiograph, the patient has been extubated and orogastric tube has been removed. Right internal jugular line tip is at lower SVC/cavoatrial junction. Mildly increased lung haziness is probably due to increase in small bilateral pleural effusions or could be a function of changes in the lung following extubation. Increased retrocardiac density is minimally worsened since yesterday. Upper lungs remain clear. There is no pneumothorax.
