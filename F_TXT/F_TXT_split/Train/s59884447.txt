Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. Mediastinal contours are unchanged with a moderate hiatal hernia again noted. Minimal atherosclerotic calcifications are seen at the aortic knob. Moderate pulmonary edema is present with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness. There are likely trace bilateral pleural effusions, with a small amount of fluid seen tracking in the minor fissure. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
