AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with a similar chest examination of ___. The patient is now intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea 6 cm above the level of the carina. A right internal jugular approach central venous line is seen and terminates overlying the right-sided mediastinal structures apparently reaching the upper third of the right atrium. No pneumothorax is present. There is moderate cardiac enlargement with a configuration favoring the left ventricle prominent to the left. The pulmonary vasculature is moderately distended with some perivascular haze, but there is no evidence of acute pulmonary edema and the lateral pleural sinuses remain free from any fluid accumulation. No pneumothorax is present in the apical area. In comparison with the previous chest examination, findings are rather similar as moderate cardiac enlargement existed already at that time.
