CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting COPD. Heart size is slightly enlarged. There is upper zone redistribution, with vascular plethora, suggestive of mild fluid overload. There is patchy opacity at the left lung base, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation. This is improved compared with a supine film from ___ at 13:37 p.m. No gross effusion is detected on either side. Minimal atelectasis at the right base is again noted.
