There has been development of bilateral, patchy parenchymal opacities, over the past 3 hr. Additionally, there is been slight enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and prominence of the central vasculature. These findings are consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. There is a thin, curvilinear lucency seen under the right hemidiaphragm, probably unchanged from 3 hr prior.
