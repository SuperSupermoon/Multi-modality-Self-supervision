As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of a right PICC line and of a left pectoral pacemaker. The size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased, given lower lung volumes, presumably caused by a lesser inspiratory effort. There is no overt pulmonary edema. Areas of bilateral atelectasis, left more than right, are seen. No evidence of pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
