In comparison with the study of ___, there is a left Pleurx catheter at the base with decreased left effusion and improved lung aeration. The hemidiaphragmatic contour is now relatively sharply seen. There has been an increase in the amount of right effusion since the previous study. The PICC line tip remains either at the cavoatrial junction or possibly in the upper portion of the right atrium.
