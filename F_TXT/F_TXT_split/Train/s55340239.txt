AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The ET tube tip is appropriately positioned. The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm, most likely terminating in the stomach. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged, overall normal. Multifocal consolidations are present, slightly improved in the left perihilar area, but worsened in the right medial lower lung and might be consistent with aspiration versus position-dependent pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen. Pleural effusion is most likely present.
