AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Small regions of peribronchial opacification in the right middle and lower lobes, seen to better advantage on the chest CTA ___, have probably improved, but there is residual opacification, most pronounced in the mid clavicular line from the right fourth anterior interspace inferiorly. It is unfortunate that a corresponding conventional chest radiograph was not obtained on ___ to serve as a baseline for subsequent studies. Tiny right pleural effusion is unchanged and of no active clinical significance. Left lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal. Dual-channel right supraclavicular central venous catheter ends in the upper right atrium.
