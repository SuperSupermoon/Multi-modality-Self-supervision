No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen. There is mild cardiomegaly and edema. No significant pleural effusion is present. No pneumothorax. There are calcifications of the aortic arch. The are multiple bilateral healed rib fractures. A bulge along the left cardiac border is possibly due to a superimposed rib deformity though will be better assessed on the pending CT to exclude aneurysm. If this is not obtained, shallow oblique radiographs may be performed. [Subsequent Chest CTA showed large left, lower lobe pneumonia.]
