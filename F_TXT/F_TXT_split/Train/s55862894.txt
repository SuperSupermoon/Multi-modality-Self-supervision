Comparison is made to previous study from ___. The tip of the endotracheal tube is 9 cm above the carina. This could be advanced 2 to 3 cm for more optimal placement. There are bilateral chest tubes. There is a right-sided central line with distal lead tip in the mid SVC. There is a Dobbhoff tube whose distal tip is in the fundus of the stomach and pointed cranially. No pneumothoraces are seen on either side. There is again seen increased opacity within the right mid lung field, which may represent pulmonary contusion versus loculated pleural fluid or consolidation. This is stable. Small pleural effusions are seen bilaterally at the bases.
