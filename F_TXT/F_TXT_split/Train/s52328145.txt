AP chest compared to ___: Moderate-to-large right pneumothorax is smaller than it was at 8:25 a.m., but larger than on ___ at 9:24 p.m. prior to the exacerbation. As noted previously, the horizontal orientation of the right pleural tube suggests that it may be fissural. New consolidation at the medial aspect of the right lung base is probably residual atelectasis. Left lung clear. Tiny right pleural effusion is expected following margin pneumothorax. Heart size normal. Dr. ___ was paged at 12:30 p.m., one minute following my recognition of the findings.
