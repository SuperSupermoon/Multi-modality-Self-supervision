AP chest compared to ___: Previous mild pulmonary edema has cleared, but there is still consolidation in the right lower and left juxta-hilar lung. Upper mediastinal widening is chronic, due to longstanding adenopathy and fat deposition. The heart is top normal size. Right PIC line ends at a level 7 cm below the carina and would need to be withdrawn 4 cm to reposition it in the low SVC if that is desired.
