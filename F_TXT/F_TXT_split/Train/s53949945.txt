Mild to moderate pulmonary edema has worsened, moderate cardiomegaly is more severe particularly evidence of left atrial enlargement. Consolidation in the left midlung has worsened, either infection or infarction. Pleural effusions if present are not substantial and there is no pneumothorax. Rightward displacement of the trachea at the thoracic inlet is usually due to enlarged left thyroid lobe.
