An ET tube is present, the tip lies at the level of the mid clavicular heads. The carina is not well defined but the tip appears to lie approximately 5.3 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm, extending off film. The side port lies in the region of the GE junction, probably slightly proximal to it. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and lung findings are stable, with prominence of upper zone vessels and, too, probable pleural-parenchymal upper zone scarring/infiltrate. Minimal atelectasis at the left and ?right base is stable. No interstitial edema, frank consolidation, or effusion.
