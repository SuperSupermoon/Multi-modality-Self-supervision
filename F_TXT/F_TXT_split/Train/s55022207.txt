Lung volumes are low which exaggerates heart size and pulmonary vasculature. Heart size is difficult to evaluate due to poor inspiratory effort. There is central vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema. Low lung volumes are associated with bibasilar atelectasis. Multiple bilateral chronic rib fractures with callus formation are similar in appearance to prior study. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
