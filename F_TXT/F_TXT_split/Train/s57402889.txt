In comparison with the study of ___, the monitor and support devices are essentially unchanged. Obliquity of the patient makes it difficult to evaluate the cardiac silhouette. There is again opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent pneumonia. There is suggestion of some increased opacification in the right upper zone, but this could merely represent previous pulmonary markings superimposed on the right clavicle because of the obliquity of the patient. Old right clavicular fracture is seen.
