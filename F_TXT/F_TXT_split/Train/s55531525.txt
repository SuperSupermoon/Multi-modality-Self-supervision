In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been a left thoracentesis with removal of pleural fluid. No evidence of appreciable post procedure pneumothorax. Some residual opacification is again seen at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and residual pleural effusion. The left basilar chest tube appears to have been removed with no definite pneumothorax.
