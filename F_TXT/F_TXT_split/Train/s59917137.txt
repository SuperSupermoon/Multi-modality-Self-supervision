The lung volumes are low, resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures and apparent prominence of the mediastinum. There is pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. Heart size is normal. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.
