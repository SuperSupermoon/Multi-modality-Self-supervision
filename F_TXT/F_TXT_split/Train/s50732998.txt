Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Multifocal patchy opacities persist bilaterally, in keeping with provided history of multifocal pneumonia, likely co-existing with areas of linear atelectasis. As compared to most recent study, there has been improved aeration in the lung bases bilaterally, but a questionable focal area of worsening is present in the right upper lobe at the level of the intersection of the right first anterior and fourth posterior ribs, an area difficult to assess due to overlying external structures. Attention to this area on followup chest x-ray would be helpful following removal or re-positioning of such structures. Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, mild-to-moderate gastric distension has developed.
