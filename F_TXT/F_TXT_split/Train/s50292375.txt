The patient is status post median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement. A left pectoral dual lead cardiac AICD is in place. The tip of a newly placed right IJ central venous catheter projects over the SVC. There has also been interval placement of an ET tube which terminates above the carina. Mediastinal drains are in place. There is a small amount of fluid adjacent to the tip of the newly placed right lung base chest tube, which likely represents a new small hemothorax. There is no pneumothorax. New obscuration of the medial left hemidiaphragm is likely due to subsegmental atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is magnified by the projection.
