Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 1.5 cm above the carina with the neck in a flexed position. Feeding tube terminates within the stomach, which is moderately distended, and the left subclavian catheter terminates in the region of the proximal right atrium. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. New patchy and linear opacities have developed in the right upper lobe with associated elevation of the minor fissure suggestive of atelectasis. Interval improved aeration of left retrocardiac region, with minimal residual linear atelectasis remaining.
