Large left and moderate right pleural effusion may be more apparent because of semi supine positioning, but both have probably increased also. Substantial left lower lobe atelectasis is presumed, and could be present on the right as well. Cardiomegaly is mild. There is no pulmonary edema. ET tube in standard placement. Right PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
