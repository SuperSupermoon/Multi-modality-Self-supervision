The right internal jugular central line appears to have its tip in the right atrium. A right chest tube remains in place. There has been interval decrease in lung volumes with worsening of bilateral airspace process suggestive of pulmonary edema. In addition, there is likely persistent partial left lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema particularly in the neck soft tissues and there is a persistent pneumomediastinum with air outlining the aortic knob. No definite pneumothorax is seen. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to diffuse airspace process.
