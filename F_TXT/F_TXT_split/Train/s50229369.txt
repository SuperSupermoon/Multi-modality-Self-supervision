CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 5:58 a.m. and allowing for technical differences, the ET tube is no longer visualized. NG tube overlies the upper stomach. A right-sided PICC line tip overlies the distal SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Diffuse opacities in both lungs and increased retrocardiac density, with partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, are overall similar to prior film.
