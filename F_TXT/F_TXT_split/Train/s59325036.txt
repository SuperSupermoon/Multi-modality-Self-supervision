Since earlier same day chest radiograph, there is near complete opacification of the left lung, likely due to new atelectasis from known obstructing left mainstem bronchial mass. The right lung appears to have mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no pulmonary edema. Heart size is difficult to assess. No pneumothorax. Right rib lesion is unchanged since prior exam and better assessed on reference CT chest.
