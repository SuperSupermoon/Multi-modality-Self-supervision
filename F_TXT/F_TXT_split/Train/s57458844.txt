There is worsening mild to moderate pulmonary edema. The left pleural effusion has increased and there is increasing retrocardiac consolidation likely representing partial lower lobe collapse, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stably enlarged. A right internal jugular hemodialysis catheter is unchanged in position with the tip within the right atrium. No pneumothorax.
