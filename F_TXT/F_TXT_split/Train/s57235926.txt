Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There are low lung volumes. ET tube tip is 1.5 cm above the carina with flexion of the neck, in appropriate position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Left IJ catheter tip is in the proximal SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged. Large areas of atelectasis in the lower lobes, left greater than right, and in the perihilar region are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. If any, there are small bilateral effusions. There is mild vascular congestion.
