Compared with the previous exam there has been interval placement of a pigtail catheter which ends in a paramediastinal location in the left mid lung region. There has been interval resolution of the previously seen pneumothorax. Severe left lower lobe atelectasis persists. The right lung is hypoinflated, resulting in bronchovascular crowding but without focal opacities.
