Compared with ___ at 12:39 and allowing for technical differences, the overall appearance is relatively similar. The interstitial markings at the left base and in the right cardiophrenic region may be slightly coarser. No frank consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected. The heart is not enlarged and could be slightly smaller. The enlargement of the main pulmonary artery is again noted, in keeping with findings on recent CT. Again noted is left subclavian PICC line, similar in a position, with tip overlying the mid/distal SVC.
