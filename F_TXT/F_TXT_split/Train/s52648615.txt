As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent and severity of the right pleural effusion, combines to areas of relatively extensive right basilar atelectasis are unchanged. The extent and severity of the left upper lobe parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms has improved but remnant opacities in this location are still clearly seen. Likewise, the left lower lung is better ventilated but still shows evidence of parenchymal opacities, similar in morphology to the left upper lobe. Moderate cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema persists.
