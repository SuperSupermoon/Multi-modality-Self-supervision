A single portable frontal upright view of the chest was obtained. Moderate cardiomegaly is again noted. There is increased opacification in the right lower lung zone with partial obliteration of the right heart border and the lateral aspect of the right hemidiaphragm. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle and the upsloping laterally of the right hemidiaphragm is suggestive of moderate right pleural effusion. The left lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal contour is otherwise unremarkable. Bones are grossly intact.
