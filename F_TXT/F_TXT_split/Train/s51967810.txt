1. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. A left subclavian central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. A right chest tube remains in place. Lung volumes remain low. There is interval appearance of an elliptical opacity abutting the right hemidiaphragm which may represent loculated fluid within the horizontal fissure or an area of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Surgical packing material is seen overlying the right upper abdomen. Low lung volumes. The previously described right lateral rib fractures are not as well seen on the current examination.
