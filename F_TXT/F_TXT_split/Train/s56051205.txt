Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position except for slightly more proximal tip of the endotracheal tube, now terminating 6.8 cm above the carina. This could be advanced a few centimeters for standard positioning. Lung volumes are relatively low. Mild cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and worsening bibasilar lung opacities, left greater than right, most likely due to atelectasis. Aspiration is an additional consideration in the appropriate clinical setting. Small bilateral pleural effusions have also apparently increased since the prior study.
