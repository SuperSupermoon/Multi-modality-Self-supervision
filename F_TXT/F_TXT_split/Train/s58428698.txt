There remains no evidence for pneumothorax. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are present, with interval decrease on the right, accompanied by slight improved aeration in the adjacent right middle and lower lobes. This may reflect improving atelectasis and/or infectious consolidation. At the left base, there is persistent retrocardiac atelectasis. Remaining portions of the lungs are clear.
