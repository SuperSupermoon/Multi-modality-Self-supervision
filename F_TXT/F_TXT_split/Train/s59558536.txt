Enteric tube is seen, coursing over expected location of the right mainstem bronchus into the right lower lobe bronchus. Recommend removal. There is a large hiatal hernia with adjacent atelectasis. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissue and atelectasis versus small pleural effusion. There is mild left base atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable. There is no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen.
