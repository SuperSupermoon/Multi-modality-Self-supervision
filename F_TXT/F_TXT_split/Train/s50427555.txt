Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The distal tracheal stent is re- demonstrated but poorly visualized. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Linear opacities within the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.
