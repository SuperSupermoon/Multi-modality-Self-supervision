A single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a spiculated lesion in the left upper lung zone with a fiducial seed. The lesion measures approximately 3.7 x 1.4 cm. It is not significantly changed in size since the recent CT of the chest. No new mass or consolidation is identified. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The heart is moderately enlarged, unchanged from the prior exam. The mediastinal contours are normal. Surgical clips project over the upper mediastinum, also unchanged from the prior exam.
