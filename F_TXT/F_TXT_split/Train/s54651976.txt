In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. The right IJ catheter again extends to the level of the cavoatrial junction. Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Nasogastric tube has been placed that extends to at least the body of the stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the image.
