The lung volumes are lower bilaterally, left greater than right. Interval increase in right lower lobe consolidation and underlying pleural effusion as seen on prior CT. The left lung is lower in volume with increased leftward mediastinal shift, likely due to worsening lower lobe atelectasis. The left lung atelectasis may be due to a mucous plug as the left bronchus appears mildly narrowed. Worsening of bilateral upper lobe ground-glass opacities as seen on prior CT. The endotracheal tube is approximately 4.5 cm from the carina. The NG tube traverses the mid stomach however the tip is inferior to the margins of the image.
