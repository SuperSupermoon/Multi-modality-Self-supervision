Radiograph centered in the lower chest was obtained for assessment of a nasogastric tube, which terminates within the body of the stomach. Within the imaged portion of the chest, cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions have slightly worsened with associated increased atelectasis at the lung bases.
