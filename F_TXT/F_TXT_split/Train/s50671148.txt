1. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Patchy opacity at the right apex most likely corresponds to the known irregular mass seen on the recent CT dated ___. There is some crowding of the pulmonary vasculature and streaky opacities at both bases likely reflecting a diminished inspiration rather than an acute process. No pleural effusions, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is appreciated, although if the patient was imaged in the supine position, the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax would be diminished. Therefore, followup imaging would be advised.
