The multiple displaced left rib fractures, with the areas of mild left parenchymal opacities and pleural thickening adjacent to this region are unchanged. Also unchanged is the appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the right lung. No larger pleural effusions are seen. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position.
