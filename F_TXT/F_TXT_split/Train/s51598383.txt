In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged with tortuosity of the descending aorta. Minimal vascular engorgement suggests mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia. Again there is apical pleural thickening predominantly on the right, consistent with old tuberculous disease.
