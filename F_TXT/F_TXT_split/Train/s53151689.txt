Visualization of the pleural lines at the both lung apices is difficult. Apical pneumothoraces however do not appear appreciably larger. A left-sided chest tube projects at the left apex. Multiple left-sided rib fractures are unchanged. Subcutaneous air along the left lateral chest wall and left neck region remain unchanged. Left basal consolidation appears slightly increased today, likely related to increased pleural fluid.
