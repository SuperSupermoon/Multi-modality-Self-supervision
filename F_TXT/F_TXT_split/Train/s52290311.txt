Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is present. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. As seen previously, innumerable tiny nodular opacities are again noted in both lung bases, compatible with chronic punctate calcifications which are likely the sequela of prior interstitial pneumonitis. No new focal consolidation or pleural effusion is present. No acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.
