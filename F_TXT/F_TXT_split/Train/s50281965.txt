Left perihilar consolidation which developed on ___ has improved, but I believe there still asymmetric interstitial pulmonary edema and moderate left pleural effusion. Heart size normal. Left pic line ends in the low SVC. Contour of the mediastinum and the enlarged left hilus containing moderate adenopathy are unchanged. The adenopathy may be contributing to asymmetric distribution of edema and predominantly left-sided pleural effusion due to lymphatic congestion.
