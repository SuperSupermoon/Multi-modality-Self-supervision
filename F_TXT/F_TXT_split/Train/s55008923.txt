As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, probably caused by pulmonary edema, are less extensive than less severe. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left, persist. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. No new parenchymal opacities. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
