The patient remains intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach. A left internal jugular venous catheter terminates in the superior vena cava. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. The mitral annulus is densely calcified. Hazy left basilar opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm suggests atelectasis with a possible pleural effusion, but is not specific. Findings also suggest mild fluid overload, but somewhat improved.
