AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained eight hours earlier during the same day. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. No pneumothorax can be identified. Similar as the most previously portable obtained chest films, the examination remains of limited quality in this apparently morbidly obese patient. Only with the knowledge of a new tube placement and manipulation of image density is one able to identify portions of an OG line overlying the left upper abdominal quadrant. Thus, there is evidence that the line has reached below the diaphragm. Position of side port cannot be evaluated.
