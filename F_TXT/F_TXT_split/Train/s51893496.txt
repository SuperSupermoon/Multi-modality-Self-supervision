Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There is interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating in the distal SVC, without evidence of pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low. Again there are bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. Left base retrocardiac opacity may represent combination of effusion and atelectasis although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. There is prominence of the hila suggesting pulmonary vascular engorgement. Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes remain in same stable position.
