Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for differences in patient's positioning. Pulmonary vascular congestion has slightly improved, and previously described bibasilar lung opacities are also somewhat better, particularly in the left retrocardiac region. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions have slightly decreased in size as well. No visible pneumothorax.
