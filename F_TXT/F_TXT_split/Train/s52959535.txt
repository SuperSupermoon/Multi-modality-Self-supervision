Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Dobbhoff tube tip is in the right upper quadrant, likely post-pyloric. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. Bibasilar opacities have increased consistent with increasing atelectasis. Of note, the patient's chin obscures the apices of the lungs, limiting the evaluation of pneumothoraces. Small left apical pneumothorax might be still present. There is mild vascular congestion.
