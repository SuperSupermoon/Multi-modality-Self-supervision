Compared with the prior study an endotracheal tube has been placed which terminates 4.5 cm from the carina, directed slightly at the right tracheal wall. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and terminates within the duodenum. Extensive parenchymal abnormality including chronic interstitial process with superimposed parenchymal opacities likely representing pneumonia is grossly unchanged from the recent prior study. There is no pneumothorax, or right-sided pleural effusion. A probable small left pleural effusion is similar to the prior study. There is also probably a superimposed interstitial pulmonary edema. A left pectoral pacemaker and its 3 leads project in unchanged location.
