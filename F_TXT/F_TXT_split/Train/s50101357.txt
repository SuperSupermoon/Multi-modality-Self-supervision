The lungs are clear of focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Lower lobe bronchiectasis is noted. The heart is normal in size. There are surgical clips projecting over the right breast. No displaced rib fractures are noted. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is clinically warranted, the location of any referable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
