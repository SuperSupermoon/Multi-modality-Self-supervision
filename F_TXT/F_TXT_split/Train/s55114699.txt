Multi focal pulmonary consolidation is very severe, accompanied by at least small bilateral pleural effusion and borderline cardiomegaly. Extensive consolidation like this is often produced by Legionella, sometimes by bacterial organisms particularly in immunocompromised patients or due to aspiration, occasionally by mycoplasma, less likely by viral pathogens alone. Noninfectious condition should be considered, including acute eosinophilic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar damage, and pulmonary hemorrhage.
