The left lateral chest is not completely included on this study. Endotracheal tube tip is 9 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube tip is beyond the GE junction and off the edge of the film. There is patchy density in the right lung base. There may be some atelectasis in the left lung base but this is difficult to evaluate had a repeat film with better patient alignment would be recommended. There is no pneumothorax or CHF.
