In comparison with study of ___, there is increased opacification bilaterally. Some of the pattern suggests pulmonary edema, though is more prominent on the left rather than on the right. This would be consistent with the history of substantial renal disease. However, there is also opacification at the right base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, which certainly could represent a region of consolidation with pleural fluid. There also is suggestion of some area of increased opacification in the left apical region laterally. However, it is possible that this represents something external to the patient. The nasogastric tube remains in place, as does the left IJ catheter.
