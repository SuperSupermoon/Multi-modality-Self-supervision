A single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6.5 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing likely below the level of the diaphragm, side port in the region of the distal esophagus/GE junction. Inferior aspect not included on the image. A right-sided subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. There are extensive bilateral mid-to-lower hemithorax opacities which may represent combination of bilateral pleural effusions and underlying aspiration given history. Infectious process is not entirely excluded. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is not optimally assessed due to the bibasilar opacities. The aortic knob is calcified. The mediastinum itself does not appear widened.
