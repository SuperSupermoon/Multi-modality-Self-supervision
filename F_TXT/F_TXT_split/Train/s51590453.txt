AP chest compared to 12:35 a.m.: Previous mild interstitial edema has improved, lung volumes have also increased, though there is still substantial atelectasis at the right lung base medially. Residual right pneumothorax is minimal, largely medial. Course of the right pleural drain should be evaluated clinically to see if it enters the pleural space twice or whether it is just folded on the chest wall. ET tube and left internal jugular line are in standard placements and an upper enteric drainage tube ends in the stomach. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
