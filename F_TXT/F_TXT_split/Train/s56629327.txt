Right pigtail pleural catheter has been replaced by a right chest tube, which courses inferomedially to overlie the lower thoracic spine near the thoracoabdominal junction level. This area is incompletely imaged on this radiograph, and the tip of the tube is not imaged. Tiny right apical pneumothorax is present as well as an apparent new moderate left apicolateral pneumothorax. Moderate right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size following the newly placed chest tube. Widespread subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum are again demonstrated. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Diffuse pulmonary opacities in the right lung appear slightly improved, but heterogeneous opacities in the left lung have slightly worsened, particularly in the retrocardiac area. Although potentially due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema, coexisting aspiration or pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Findings communicated by telephone with Dr. ___ on ___ at 10:30 a.m. at the time of discovery.
