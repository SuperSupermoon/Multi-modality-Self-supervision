As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube and the Swan-Ganz catheter have also been removed. The left chest tube, the right chest tube and the mediastinal drains as well as the right venous introduction sheath are in unchanged position. The lung volumes have decreased. As a consequence, the size of the cardiac silhouette has increased. There is no overt pulmonary edema, but the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions as well as minimal fluid overload cannot be excluded. Bilateral areas of atelectasis at the lung bases.
