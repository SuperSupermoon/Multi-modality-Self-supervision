The ET tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina. A right transjugular central venous catheter has tip in the lower SVC. There is moderate cardiomegaly, which is accentuated by AP technique. There is progressive increase in dense consolidation in the right upper lobe and also increased opacities in the left perihilar region and left lower lobe, consistent with worsening multifocal pneumonia. The left lung is reasonably aerated, with streaky subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe. There is likely a small right pleural effusion.
