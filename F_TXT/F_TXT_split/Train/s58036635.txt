The study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube tip appears to be coiled within the upper esophagus. Transvenous pacer entering via a right internal jugular approach terminates in the region of the right ventricle. No pneumothorax is identified. The heart is moderately enlarged. The superior mediastinum appears widened, and this could be accentuated by supine positioning and low lung volumes. The aortic knob is calcified. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. Bibasilar atelectasis is likely present. No pleural effusion is identified.
