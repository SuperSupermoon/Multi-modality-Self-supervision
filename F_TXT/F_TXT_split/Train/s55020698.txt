Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube is in standard position, 4.5 cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Cardiac size is top normal. There are low lung volumes. There is no evident pneumothorax. Bibasilar opacities, larger on the right side, have increased. These could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Other multifocal mainly peripheral opacities in the right upper lobe are unchanged. If any, there is a small right effusion.
