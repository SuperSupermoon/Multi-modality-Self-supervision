Cardiomegaly is moderate to severe, grossly unchanged as compared to prior study. Post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable. Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded. There is re-demonstration of right middle lobe atelectasis. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen. No evidence of pulmonary edema is seen. No definitive pneumonia is demonstrated and the left retrocardiac atelectasis is unlikely to reflect infectious process.
