An intended transesophageal gastric drainage tube ends in the right lower lobe bronchus. I do not believe an endotracheal tube is in place. These issues were presumably discussed by the radiology resident Dr. ___ with Dr. ___, as reported below. Lung volumes are exceedingly low, exaggerating pulmonary vascular congestion, possible mild edema, and moderate cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusion on the left could be small to moderate. Shunt catheter traverses the right neck and upper chest, but termination below the diaphragm is indistinct.
