Left subclavian PICC line, with tip overlying the upper right atrium, near SVC/RA junction. Please see wet reading below. The heart is not enlarged. Aorta slightly unfolded. Mild prominence of the superior mediastinum is likely accentuated by supine AP technique. There is slight upper zone redistribution, also likely accentuated by technique. No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is detected. No supine film evidence of pneumothorax is detected. Metal overlying the right shoulder appears to represent some form of shoulder arthroplasty. There is increased lucency about the proximal humeral component, not fully evaluated on this exam. Findings in left shoulder suggest glenohumeral arthritis, chronic rotator cuff tear, and soft tissue anchor which could reflect prior rotator cuff repair.
