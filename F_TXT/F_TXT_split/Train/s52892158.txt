Moderately severe pulmonary edema has changed in distribution, more on the left, less so on the right, but not in overall severity. Moderate right pleural effusion is larger. Moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement are stable. Aeration of the left lower lobe has diminished, usually due to combination of atelectasis and edema, but concerning for infection. A second region of possible focal consolidation is a nodular opacity projecting over the anterior aspect of the right first rib which, alternatively, could be due to bony sclerosis. Followup advised with conventional radiographs if feasible. There is no Pneumothorax.
