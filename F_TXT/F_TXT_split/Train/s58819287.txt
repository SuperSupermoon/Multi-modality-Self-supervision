Interstitial opacities predominantly within the lung bases appear similar compared to prior examination and correspond with known bronchiectasis. Mild prominence of the upper lung vasculature suggests new superimposed vascular congestion; however, there is no overt edema or large effusions. No confluent consolidation is identified. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. No pneumothorax is evident. Healed right-sided rib fractures are unchanged from prior.
