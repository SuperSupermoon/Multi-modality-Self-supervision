There is slight improved aeration of the left lung base as compared to most recent prior radiograph, likely due to decreased atelectasis. However, a moderate consolidation and associated moderate effusion persist and are consistent with the clinical history of pneumonia. There is increased pulmonary vascular congestion, mild, though no overt interstitial edema. There is no pneumothorax. An enteric catheter terminates within the stomach.
