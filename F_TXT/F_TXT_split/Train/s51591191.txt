A single portable AP view of the chest was obtained. In comparison to the prior study, there is a moderate-to-large left pleural effusion and adjacent compressive atelectasis. A small right pleural effusion is also probably present. The lungs are otherwise clear. Enlarged mediastinal and hilar nodes are better appreciated on CT.
