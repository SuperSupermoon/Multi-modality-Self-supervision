ET tube tip lies 3.7 cm above the carina. NG tube tip extends beneath diaphragm to overlie the stomach. A right-sided PICC line is again noted. Lead tip is obscured by the EKG marker, but it probably overlies the distal most SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Again seen is increased retrocardiac density with probable small left effusion, very slightly improved. Small left effusion would again be difficult to exclude. Hazy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is also similar to the prior study, but may be slightly more extensive. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, consistent with mild CHF.
