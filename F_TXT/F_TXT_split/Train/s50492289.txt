Assessment of this radiograph is limited by poor positioning with left lateral rotation as well as exclusion from the field of view of both costophrenic angles. Allowing for these limitations, an endotracheal tube is seen with the tip ending approximately 3.5 cm from the carina. An esophageal tube is present with the tip coursing inferiorly below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not fully included on the image. There is an ill-defined opacity projecting over the right cardiophrenic angle which is partially obscuring the right heart border as well as margin of the thoracic spine. No focal opacities are noted in the left lung. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
