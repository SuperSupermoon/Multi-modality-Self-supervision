Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Fiducial marker is noted within a left upper lobe spiculated nodule which was better assessed on the previous CT. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases, improved from previous examinations, more pronounced on the right and likely reflective of atelectasis. Lungs are hyperinflated. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, although the medial lung apices are obscured by the patient's neck. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
