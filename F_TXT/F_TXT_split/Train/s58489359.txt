Extensive bibasilar opacities slightly improved compared with the prior study. A uniform opacity overlying the right lung field suggests at least a moderate pleural effusion. A calcified right paratracheal structure corresponds to a calcified mediastinal lymph node. The tracheostomy tube, a right-sided chest tube, right IJ central venous catheter, and right PICC line appear in unchanged position. Sternotomy wires are intact.
