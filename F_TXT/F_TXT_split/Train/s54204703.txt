An endotracheal tube ends 3.3 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm and likely out of the field-of-view inferiorly. A new right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the uppermost portion of the SVC. Heterogeneous right upper lobe opacities are some combination of postoperative hemorrhage, atelectasis, and infection. Heterogeneous left perihilar opacities correlate to ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe seen on the accompanying CT from ___, possibly additional areas of infection. Right greater than left small bilateral pleural effusions are better appreciated on the accompanying CT. There is moderate left and minimal right basilar compressive atelectasis. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal.
