Left lung remains entirely collapsed, accounting for marked leftward mediastinal shift, somewhat exaggerated by rotation, obscuring the volume of left pleural effusion. Right lung is grossly clear. ET tube, transesophageal drainage tube, and right subclavian line are in standard placements respectively. Right pleural effusion small if any. No pneumothorax.
