Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Apart from streaky atelectasis at the left lung base, the lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Assessment of the right lung apex is somewhat obscured by the neck soft tissues projecting over this region. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
