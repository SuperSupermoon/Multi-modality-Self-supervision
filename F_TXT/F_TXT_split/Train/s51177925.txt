Tip of the endotracheal tube ends approximately 4.4 cm above the carina, right internal jugular line terminates at mid SVC, and orogastric tube is seen to course into the stomach; however, the distal end is looped with the tip in the fundus. Since yesterday's radiograph, increased opacity in the left lower lung, reflecting atelectasis, has improved. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. There are no new lung opacities on the right side. Minimal opacity in the right lung base from the prior radiograph has resolved suggesting it was atelectasis. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax.
