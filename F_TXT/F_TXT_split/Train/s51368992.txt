The study is limited due to patient rotation. The aorta remains diffusely calcified and markedly tortuous, relatively unchanged compared to the prior exam. The heart size is at least mildly enlarged. Calcified right superior mediastinal nodule, likely thyroid in origin, is again seen. No pulmonary vascular engorgement is identified. The left lung is grossly clear. Hazy opacity within the right lung base could reflect a combination of atelectasis and small pleural effusion though infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is identified. Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is present.
