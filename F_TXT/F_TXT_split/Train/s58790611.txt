The lungs appear somewhat hyperinflated raising concern for underlying emphysema. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. There are streaky opacities along the right medial lung base which when correlated with the recent chest CT likely reflect an infectious process. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions.
