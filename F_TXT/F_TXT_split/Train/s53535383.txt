Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Bilateral heterogeneous lung opacities involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left show interval slight improvement. These findings are probably superimposed upon chronic lung disease. Focal lucency in the region of the left lateral costophrenic sulcus raises the possibility of a small basilar pneumothorax, for which short-term followup radiographs are suggested.
