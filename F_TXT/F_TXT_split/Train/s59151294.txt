AP chest compared to ___: Little if any pneumothorax, left apical pleural drain in place. Fullness in the left hilus, presumably a post-operative artifact, should be followed to exclude possibility of continued bleeding. There is no layering pleural effusion. Mild cardiomegaly presumably reflects recent volume status. Right lung is clear and there is no right pleural effusion. ___ and I discussed the findings by telephone, 2:15pm.
