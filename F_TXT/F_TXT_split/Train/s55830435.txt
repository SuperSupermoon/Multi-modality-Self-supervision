Single AP supine portable view of the chest is obtained. There is minimal placement endotracheal tube, which terminates approximately 2 cm above level the carinal. The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement. Prominence and indistinctness of the hila has increased since the prior study, in part may be related to lower lung volumes and supine position, however, increased fluid overload as compared to the prior study may be present. No large pleural effusion is seen although trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in patient position.
