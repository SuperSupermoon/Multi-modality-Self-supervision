An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film. Again seen is dense patchy opacity at the right base, with air bronchograms, consistent with right base collapse and/or consolidation and a small right effusion. Also again seen is increased retrocardiac opacity with a small left effusion, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with a small left effusion. Upper zone re-distribution and mild vascular plethora is suggested, slightly more pronounced than on the prior film. Doubt overt CHF.
