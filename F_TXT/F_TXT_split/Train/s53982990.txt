Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. There are perihilar and bibasilar opacities which may relate to fluid overload, although underlying infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusions are seen, although trace pleural effusions be difficult to exclude. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The aortic knob is calcified. No pneumothorax is seen.
