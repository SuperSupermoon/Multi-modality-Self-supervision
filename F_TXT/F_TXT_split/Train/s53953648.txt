There is an intra-aortic balloon pump whose distal tip is at the aortic knob. This could be pulled back approximately 2.5 cm for more optimal placement. There is also a Swan-Ganz catheter whose tip is now pointing towards the left pulmonary artery origin. Heart size is within normal limits. There is some atelectasis at the right lung base. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces.
