Nasogastric tube is seen, coursing below the level off the diaphragm, inferior aspect not seen. There is persistent prominence of the left hilum. Left mid to lower lung patchy opacities are less confluent, although this difference may relate to changes in patient positioning and inspiration; however, remain concerning for infection and/or aspiration.
