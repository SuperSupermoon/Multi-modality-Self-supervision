In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been a thoracentesis with removal of a large amount of pleural fluid. No evidence of post procedure pneumothorax. The tip of the right subclavian catheter is at about at the level of the cavoatrial junction. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion. Left pleural effusion with compressive basilar atelectasis is again seen.
