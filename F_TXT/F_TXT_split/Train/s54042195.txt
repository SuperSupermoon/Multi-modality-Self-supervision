AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Pacemaker defibrillator leads terminate in the expected locations of the right atrium, right ventricle and epicardial vein of the left ventricle. Heart size is normal. There is dilatation of the right upper mediastinum, potentially reflecting dilated veins, but attention to this area and comparison with prior studies is recommended since other etiologies such as thyroid enlargement or lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded. If no prior studies are available, correlation with cross-sectional imaging is required. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
