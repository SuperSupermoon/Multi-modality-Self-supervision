A small portion of the left apex is not included in the study. Allowing for this limitation, there is no evidence of a pneumothorax. A left chest wall AICD device is seen with leads in the expected position of the right atrium and right ventricle. Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right are noted. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
