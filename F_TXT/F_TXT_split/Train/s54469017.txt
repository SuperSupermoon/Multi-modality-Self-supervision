Residual consolidation in the left lower lung may be slightly larger today, and left pleural effusion small if any. No pneumothorax. Left basal pigtail drainage catheter still in place. Region of consolidation in the right mid lung which developed acutely earlier in the day is slightly smaller. I have discussed the possibility that this could be pulmonary infarction with the patient's physician, ___. ___. Mild cardiomegaly persists. Left circumflex and anterior descending coronary arteries are heavily calcified. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric drainage tube ends in the mid to distal portion of a nondistended stomach.
