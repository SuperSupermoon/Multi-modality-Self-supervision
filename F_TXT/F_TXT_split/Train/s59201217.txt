Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates right internal jugular central venous catheter projecting over mid SVC. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing through the esophagus, its tip out of view. Costophrenic angles are obscured, suggestive of small pleural effusions. Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis. There is no pulmonary edema. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax.
