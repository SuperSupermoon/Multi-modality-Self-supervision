A feeding tube enters the stomach. A left PICC line terminates in the low SVC. There is stable elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Bilateral perihilar airspace opacities are unchanged. Slightly increased left basilar retrocardiac airspace opacification is most likely due to atelectasis, but pneumonia or aspiration would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits despite the projection.
