As seen on the prior CT there is consolidation in the right upper lobe. Increased opacity at the right lung base likely reflect a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Left lower lobe atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion also noted. No new areas of consolidation seen. No pneumothorax seen.
