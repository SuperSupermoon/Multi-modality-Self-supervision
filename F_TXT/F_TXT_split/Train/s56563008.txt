Endotracheal tube has its tip 5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. A right pleural catheter remains in place. There is persistent retrocardiac consolidation likely reflecting lower lobe collapse with associated layering effusion. Clinical correlation is advised as superimposed infection cannot be excluded. No pulmonary edema. Small right apical pneumothorax. Multiple right-sided rib fractures are again seen. Air within the right lateral chest wall soft tissues consistent with subcutaneous emphysema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
