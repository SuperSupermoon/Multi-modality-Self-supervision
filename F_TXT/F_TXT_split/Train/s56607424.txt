Portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates ET tube terminating 1.9 cm above the carina. The lung volumes are low bilaterally and there is a moderate pleural effusion on the right with basilar atelectasis. Leftward deviation of the trachea and mediastinum are consistent with volume loss from left lower lobe collapse. Aortic arch calcifications are visualized, but the remaining portions of the cardiomediastinal silhouette are not well seen.
