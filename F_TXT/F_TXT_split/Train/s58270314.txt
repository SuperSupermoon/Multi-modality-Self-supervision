Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 6.5 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. Patchy opacity at the left costophrenic angle may be due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis with possible consolidation. There are also subtle opacities in the medial upper hemithorax bilaterally, which could be due to underlying consolidations. No evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
