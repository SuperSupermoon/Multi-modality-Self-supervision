Rotated positioning. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. A left subclavian central line tip overlies the cavoatrial junction. VP shunt noted. An NG tube is present. The configuration appears similar to the prior film, with extension meets the diaphragm, a hairpin curve below the edge of the film, and the tip overlying the gastric fundus. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. There is more confluent hazy opacity in the right mid and lower zones compared to the prior film. Faint hazy opacity in the retrocardiac region is again noted.
