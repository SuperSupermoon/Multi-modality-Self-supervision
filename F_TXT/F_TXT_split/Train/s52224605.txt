Left internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. Heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. There are small layering effusions. Perihilar fullness and patchy bibasilar opacities are now present and likely reflect mild pulmonary edema with compressive atelectasis of the lower lobes. Incidental note is made of an azygos lobe. No pneumothorax.
