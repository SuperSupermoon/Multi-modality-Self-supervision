Endotracheal tube terminates 4.8 cm above the carina. Lucencies projecting over the left neck are again seen, raising concern for subcutaneous emphysema. There may also be a tiny focus of soft tissue gas projecting over the right neck. Pneumomediastinum along the trachea is not excluded. Streaky left base opacity is most likely due to atelectasis. No definite focal consolidation is seen. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
