In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size and there is evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral effusions with substantial volume loss at the left lower lobe. Dense calcification of the mitral annulus is seen. No definite leftward shift of the mediastinum is seen at this time.
