The patient is both rotated and leaning foward which limits assessment. Again seen is a right internal jugular venous catheter terminating in the mid SVC. An endotracheal tube is again seen in standard position. A feeding is tube passes into the stomach with tip below the field of view. Comparison is difficult however there is minimal increase in bilateral airspace opacities consistent with mildly worsening pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are grossly unchanged. There is no appreciable pneumothorax however the patient's chin is obscuring the apex of the left lung.
