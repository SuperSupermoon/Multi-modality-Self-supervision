A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates clear lungs aside from minimal bibasilar atelectasis. The heart size is stably minimally enlarged, and there is slight widening of the upper mediastinal silhouette suggestive of central venous engorgement. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The pulmonary vascularity is normal and there is no edema.
