In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, no significant changes are appreciated. Moderate cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema, and small, left greater than right pleural effusions are unchanged. No new focal opacities. No pneumothorax. A right-sided IJ Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the mid descending right pulmonary artery, several cm beyond optimal placement. Median sternotomy wires are intact and unchanged in alignment.
