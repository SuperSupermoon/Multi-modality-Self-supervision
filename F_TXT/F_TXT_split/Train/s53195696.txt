In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly improved lung volumes. The endotracheal and nasogastric tubes are in good position. Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Opacification at the left base with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in left lower lobe. At the right base, there is heterogeneous opacification. Although this could represent merely atelectatic changes, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia should be seriously considered.
