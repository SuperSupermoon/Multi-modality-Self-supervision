1. There has been interval placement of a left basilar chest tube with re-expansion of the left upper and mid lung and persistent collapse of the left lower lung. There is a loculated basilar pneumothorax now evident, and the pleural fluid has been evacuated. A left basilar pigtail catheter remains in the costophrenic sulcus. There is some gas within the left lateral chest wall soft tissues, likely related to recent chest tube insertion. Right lung remains well inflated and clear. The endotracheal tube has its tip 5 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC, and left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC. The heart is enlarged. This is unchanged dating back to ___ and therefore likely reflects cardiomegaly rather than a pericardial effusion. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG. Gastrostomy tube is incompletely visualized overlying the left upper quadrant.
