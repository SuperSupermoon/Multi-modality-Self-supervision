Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. NG tube tip is in the right lower lung. The tube has been repositioned in a followup study performed 30 minutes after this was taken. Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable. Bibasilar opacities have improved on the right; these can represent atelectases or aspiration pneumonia. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Presumed bilateral pleural effusions are stable. Spinal hardware is again noted.
