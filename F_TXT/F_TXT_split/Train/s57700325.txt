AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained. A double-barrel Port-A-Cath is again seen residing over the right axilla with catheter tip extending to the level of the low SVC. There is a retrocardiac opacity with air-fluid level likely representing known large hiatal hernia. Left basal linear density is likely scarring. No effusion or pneumothorax. Old right upper rib deformities are noted.
