As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the left-sided chest tube is unchanged. In the interval, the patient has received the new esophageal stent. The pre-existing area of platelike atelectasis at the left lung bases, together with a small pre-existing pleural effusion, has mildly increased in extent. Also increased in extent is at pre-existing right basal opacity. No other relevant changes. No pneumothorax. The displaced left rib fractures are constant.
