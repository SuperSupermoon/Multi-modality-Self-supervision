AP chest compared to ___. Pulmonary edema which cleared between ___ and ___ has recurred, as severe as it was before. It is accompanied by acute distention of pulmonary arteries and mediastinal veins, and probably pleural effusion, small to moderate on the left, smaller on the right. Surprisingly, mild cardiomegaly is less pronounced today than it was on ___. ET tube is in standard position. Left subclavian line ends low in the SVC or upper right atrium. A feeding tube can be traced as far as the distal esophagus but the tip more readily visible because it is more radiodense, is not seen and is therefore beyond the field of view. No pneumothorax.
