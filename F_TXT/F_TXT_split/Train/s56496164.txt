A new left-sided central venous line terminates in the upper portion of the superior vena cava. There is no evidence of pneumothorax although the chin overlies the apex limiting the evaluation. Compared to the prior study, the lung volumes are lower otherwise the lungs are stable with calcified nodules in the right upper lung.
