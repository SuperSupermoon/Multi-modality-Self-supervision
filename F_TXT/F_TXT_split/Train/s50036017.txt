In comparison with the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there is been interval intubation. An ET tube terminates 2.8 cm above the carina. An enteric tube side port projects over the mid stomach. No other significant changes are appreciated. Right upper lung and perihilar opacification is similar, probably a combination of known lung cancer with postobstructive pneumonia. Substantial emphysematous changes are stable bilaterally.
