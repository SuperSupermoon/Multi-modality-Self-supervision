A single frontal image of the chest demonstrates clearing of the previously seen mild pulmonary edema. Now seen is a left pleural effusion, unchanged in size from previous imaging. A small right pleural effusion is also seen. Calcifications at the lung bases are again seen which are consistent with asbestos exposure. The cardiac silhouette is very large. The left-sided predominance of the patient's pleural effusion could unusual, left dominant pleural effusion due to heart failure (usually right-sided predominance), but could also be due to pleural pathology or pleuro-pericarditis. Given the findings of asbestos exposure, this raises concern for mesothelioma.
