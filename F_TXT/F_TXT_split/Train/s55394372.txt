In the interval since the prior study, a right-sided chest tube has been placed. There has been interval resolution of the previously demonstrated layering pleural effusion. No pneumothorax seen. No consolidation or pleural effusion seen. A right-sided PICC terminates in the proximal SVC. An endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the level the carina. A nasogastric tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm. Old healed right-sided rib fractures were better demonstrated on the prior study.
