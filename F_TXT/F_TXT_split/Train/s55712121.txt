Since the prior exam, an endotracheal tube has been placed. It is 5.3 cm from the carina. Again, there is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, slightly increased on the left. A tiny left pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are normal. The heart is mildly enlarged.
