Interval removal of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. Increased interval width of cardiomediastinal contours including the azygos vein and vascular pedicle, accompanied by worsening pulmonary vascular congestion. Increasing perihilar haziness and development of asymmetrical right perihilar alveolar opacity; the latter may reflect asymmetrical edema, but aspiration and infectious pneumonia are important additional considerations given the clinical suspicion for these entities. Short-term followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
