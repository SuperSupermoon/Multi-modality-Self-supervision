Compared with the prior film, I doubt significant interval change. Multiple EKG leads overlie the chest. An NG tube is present, tip over fundus. A dual-lumen right IJ catheter is present, unchanged. A left subclavian central line tip overlies the proximal/ mid SVC, unchanged. Again seen is cardiomegaly, upper zone redistribution and slight vascular plethora, bibasilar collapse and slight or consolidation, and small bilateral effusions. The left peritracheal density is again noted, unchanged.
