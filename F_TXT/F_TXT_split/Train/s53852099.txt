Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs are low in volume with diffuse reticular opacities, confluent more peripherally and more pronounced basally, which is consistent with pulmonary fibrotic disease. In the absence of prior examinations, it is difficult to assess if a given area has focally increased to reflect an acute change secondary to either infection or fluid accumulation. However, prominence of the pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature in this context suggests mild edema. Heart size is top normal with normal aortic contours.
