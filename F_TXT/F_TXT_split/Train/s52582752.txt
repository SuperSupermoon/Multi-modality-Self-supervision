Interval removal of enteric catheter, endotracheal tube and bilateral drains without development of pneumothorax. Linear lucency at the level of the left upper mediastinum may represent a small pneumomediastinum. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Minimal left lower lung opacification likely reflects atelectasis. No pleural effusion evident.
