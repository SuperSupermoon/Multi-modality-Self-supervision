AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging here: Heart is moderately enlarged, bilateral pleural effusions probably moderate in size, accompanying mild interstitial pulmonary edema attest to cardiac decompensation. Additionally, there is dense consolidation in the left lower lobe which could be pneumonia or collapse and should be reevaluated after hemodynamic status improves. Heart size is top normal. No pneumothorax.
