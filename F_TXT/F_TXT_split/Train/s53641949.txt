Since the prior exam, the right chest tube has been removed. No pneumothorax is identified. The lung volumes have slightly improved, though there is persistent retrocardiac atelectasis. There is no new opacity or pulmonary edema. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions are present. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with an expected post-operative appearance. A right internal jugular central venous catheter is present with the tip in the low SVC.
