AP chest compared to 11:10 p.m. on ___: The left pleural tube still impinges on the mediastinum at the level of the carina. Skin folds project over the left lung in the upperexpanded hemithorax. Subcutaneous emphysema is more pronounced. To assess pneumothorax would require right decubitus chest films since the patient presumably cannot tolerate sitting erect. Atelectasis in the infrahilar right lung which preceded surgery is still severe. Mediastinum is unremarkable, although possibly slightly rightward shifted as before. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right jugular line and left PIC line are central. Dr. ___ was paged to discuss possibility of pneumothorax at 10:56, 2 minutes after the findings were recognized, and we discussed the findings by telephone at 12:05pm.
