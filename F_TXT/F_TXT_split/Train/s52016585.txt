As compared to the previous radiograph, the course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged. The device, however, must have been advanced in the interval, given that the tip is no longer included on the image. Simultaneously, however, the endotracheal tube was also advanced. The tip of the tube is now within 1 cm of the orifice of the right main bronchus and the device should be pulled back by approximately 1-2 cm, to avoid accidental right bronchial intubation. Unchanged bilateral areas of basilar atelectasis. Low lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly. No larger pleural effusions.
