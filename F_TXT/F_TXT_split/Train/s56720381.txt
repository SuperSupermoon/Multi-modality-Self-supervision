Left subclavian central line is present, tip over distal most SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Compared with the prior study, opacification at the right base has progressed. Focal opacity in the left upper zone laterally, overlying the inferior left scapula, has also progressed. Faintbackground hazy opacities are again noted. It would be difficult to exclude a component of interstitial edema, but opacities related to infection might also account for this appearance. Minimal blunting the right costophrenic angle is new. Gross effusion identified.
