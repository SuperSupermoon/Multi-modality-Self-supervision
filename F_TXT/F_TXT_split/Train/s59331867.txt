Again, there is near-complete opacification of the right lung due to a combination of effusion, consolidation, and tumor burden. In the left lung, the patchy rounded opacities have increased since the prior radiograph performed five hours prior. There is likely a trace left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. The osseous structures demonstrate increased density, consistent with diffuse metastatic disease.
