Lungs are clear with no consolidation. Bilateral hila are enlarged, likely secondary to vascular engorgement. There is no pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Indistinct margin of the right hemidiaphragm may be secondary to overlapping densities from an adjacent loop of bowel. No definite evidence of subdiaphragmatic free air. Correlation with abdominal radiographs are recommended.
