AP chest compared to ___: There has been no change in the caliber of the mediastinum, with mild widening at the level of the carina or in the contour of the thoracic aorta which is not dilated. The heart is normal size, and there is no pleural effusion. Lungs are clear, and there is no pneumothorax. It is important to note that aortic dissection can occur without any change in contours recognizable on conventional chest radiographs, and therefore, CT scanning is recommended to assess any reasonable concern about acute aortic dissection.
