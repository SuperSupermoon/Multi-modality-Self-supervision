As compared to the previous radiograph, a pigtail catheter was inserted into the left pleural space. The catheter is in correct position. The extensive left pleural effusion has substantially decreased and is now limited to the lower third of the left hemi thorax. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The right lung is unchanged.
