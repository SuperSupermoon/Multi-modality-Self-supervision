As compared to the previous image, there is no relevant change. Severe pulmonary emphysema, moderate-to-severe overinflation. Small size of the cardiac silhouette. Loss of structure in the upper lung zones. An apparent increase in density at the medial bases of the right lung is caused by soft tissue superposition. No pleural effusions.
