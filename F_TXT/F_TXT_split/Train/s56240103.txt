Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior study. A new upper enteric tube ends in the stomach. The endotracheal tube is in unchanged position within 1 cm of the carina and if pullbacked back 2 cm would be in proper position. Low lung volumes and bilateral parenchymal opacities are unchanged and likely represent mild pulmonary edema and severe bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
