As compared to previous study from earlier the same date, the patient has been intubated, with endotracheal tube in standard position, and a nasogastric tube is been placed, coursing below the diaphragm. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Interval improved aeration at the right lung base with near resolution of recently described right lower lobe opacification. Persistent left retrocardiac opacity, possibly corresponding to the history of pneumonia.
