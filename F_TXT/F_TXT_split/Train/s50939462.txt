The endotracheal tube and left subclavian line are in adequate position and unchanged. Unchanged right chest tube. No pneumothorax. Deterioration of alveolar and interstitial opacities bilaterally, compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. Worsening of more round and well-defined density in the right perihilar region. In the first CT scan, we saw a right perihilar contusion that got better in time : so this round density is less likely related to the trauma. It could be a superimposed infection or aspiration. The left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged. Progression of the moderate pleural effusion bilaterally.
