Interval removal of Swan-Ganz catheter. Other indwelling devices are in standard position. Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with a persistent moderate right basilar pneumothorax. Extensive airspace consolidation persists within the right upper lobe with internal tubular lucencies, some of which may represent aerated bronchi, but others could reflect areas of cavitation. Lung volumes are slightly increased compared to the prior radiograph with associated improved aeration at the lung bases with residual patchy opacities remaining. Areas of subcutaneous emphysema have improved within the chest wall since the recent study.
