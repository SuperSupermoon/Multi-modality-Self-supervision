In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Central catheter tip remains in place. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour with blunting of the costophrenic angles is again seen consistent with fluid and atelectasis. Some increasing atelectatic changes are seen at the left base. Again there is evidence of previous cervical fusion.
