A new small caliber chest tube has been placed, terminating at the right lung apex. A right-sided pneumothorax is dramatically smaller and perhaps fully resolved, although potentially with trace lucency near the tip of the tube. The right lung is reexpanded with mild residual atelectasis of the right upper lobe. Mediastinal shift has resolved. The left lung remains clear.
