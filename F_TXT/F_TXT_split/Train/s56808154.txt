Portable semiupright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There is persistent small right sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. The left lung base has a similar appearance to prior with a tiny left-sided pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. The right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the mid-to-distal SVC. Tracheostomy tube ends 4.6 cm from the carina. No pneumothorax.
