A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. A prostatic aortic valve is seen projected over the heart. Lung volumes are low, which may accentuate bronchovascular markings. The lungs are grossly clear. The cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits. The aorta is unfolded and shows extensive mural calcification. There is no evidence of large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Note is made of old rib fractures.
