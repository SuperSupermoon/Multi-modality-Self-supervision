Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Slight improvement in left retrocardiac opacity likely due to improving atelectasis with or without adjacent infectious consolidation. More heterogeneous opacities in the periphery of the left mid and lower lung appear slightly worsened and may be due to provided history of pseudomonas infection. Poorly defined opacity at the right lung base is also slightly worsened, but adjacent area of pleuroparenchymal scarring at the lateral costophrenic angle is unchanged.
