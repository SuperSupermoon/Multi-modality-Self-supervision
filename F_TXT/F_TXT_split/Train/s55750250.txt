CHEST, SINGLE PORTAL VW An ET tube is present, tip at the level of the mid-clavicular heads approximately 4.2 cm above the carina. A left-sided PICC line is present, tip over mid SVC. The patient is rotated. Allowing for this, there is asymmetric vascular plethora and interstitial edema, and, at the lung base, more confluent opacity, all more pronounced on the right side. This may represent asymmetric CHF. There is also atelectasis and ? small effusion at the right base. There is increased retrocardiac opacity and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Compared with ___ at 14:38 p.m., the CHF findings are similar. Left base opacity has progressed. The orogastric tube has been removed.
