A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate on the right and small on the left. The right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis are unchanged, while the left pleural effusion has improved with improved aeration of the left lung. The upper lung zones are clear. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No pneumothorax.
