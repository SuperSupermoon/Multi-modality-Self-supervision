History for prior chest x-ray indicates the patient is status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through. Rotated positioning. ET tube tip lies 8 cm above the carina at the level of the midclavicular heads. This lies relatively high and advancement clinical correlation regarding advancement is requested. An orogastric type tube extends to the right and mediastinum, beneath the diaphragm off the film. An additional linear density follows the same course. Again seen is the left subclavian central line does not cross the midline to the SVC. Rather, the tip projects over the distal left brachiocephalic vein, similar to prior. No well-defined pneumothorax is identified. There remains subtle lucency at the left base laterally and along the medial aspect of the left lung near the aortic knob which could represent some residual loculated pneumothorax. Again seen is the left chest tube with the sideport very slightly retracted compared to prior film, now all straddling the outer cortex of the chest wall. Retrocardiac density, opacity at the right base, pleural fluid and/or thickening along the upper right chest wall are all similar and some hazy opacity in the left mid zone are all similar to the prior study. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is also similar to the prior study. Mediastinal clips again noted. Previously seen contrast in the neo esophagus has passed.
