There has been placement of an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 5.2 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. There is a nasogastric tube whose distal tip is at the GE junction. This could be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal placement. There is a right PICC line with the distal tip in the distal SVC. Heart size is within normal limits. Lungs are grossly clear. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces.
