The heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Extensive emphysematous changes are again seen, most pronounced within the upper lobes bilaterally. Deformity of the left upper and lateral hemithorax with increased sclerosis of the left anterolateral ribs is a result of patient's known large chest wall mass, better demonstrated on the prior chest CT. Trace left pleural effusion is again seen. No new areas of focal consolidation, right pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
