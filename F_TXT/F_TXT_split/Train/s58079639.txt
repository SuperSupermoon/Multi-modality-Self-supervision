As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Massive fibrotic changes in the left lung, with reduction in size of the left hemithorax and subsequent overinflation on the right. The right lung base shows unchanged areas of atelectasis but no evidence of new parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax. No larger pleural effusions.
