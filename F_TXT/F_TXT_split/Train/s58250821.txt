Tip of the new endotracheal tube is in standard placement. The right jugular introducer is sharply folded and may be occluded. Clinical correlation advised. Right PIC line is traceable only to deep axilla at the edge of the right hemi thorax. Combination of residual left pleural effusion and extensive left lung consolidation is unchanged. Lower lung volumes may account for greater vascularity in the right lung, but this could reflect early cardiac decompensation. Followup advised.
