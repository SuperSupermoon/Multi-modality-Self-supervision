In comparison with the study of ___, there has been the development of some hazy opacification at the left base and mid zone, raising the possibility of some re-accumulation of pleural fluid despite the chest tube in place. No evidence of pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacification has increased with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm medially, consistent with increasing volume loss in the left lower lobe. Otherwise little change.
