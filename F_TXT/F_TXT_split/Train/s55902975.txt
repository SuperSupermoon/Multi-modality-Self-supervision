1. No acute cardiopulmonary process. 2. No definite free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm. To exclude free air under the right hemidiaphragm a true upright radiograph or CT could be performed. 3. Area of increased opacification projecting over the anterior left first rib may represent degenerative change, however a pulmonary process cannot be excluded. Recommend apical lordotic view for additional evaluation.
