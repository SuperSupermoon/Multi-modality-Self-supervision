AP portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which accentuate bronchovascular markings. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is normal. There is no pulmonary edema. Linear opacities at the lung bases most likely represent atelectasis. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
