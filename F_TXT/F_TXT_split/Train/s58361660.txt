This radiograph limit substantial portions of each lung and captures a remarkable amount of the abdomen. Specifically neither lung apex nor the lateral left lung are visualized. The distal end of a Dobhoff tube coils the gastric fundus. There is unchanged elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with gas-filled colon and small bowel inferiorly. There is mild left basilar atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. Heart size and cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. A central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
