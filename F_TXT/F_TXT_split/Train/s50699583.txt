Indwelling support and monitoring devices are similar in position to the prior study except for slight repositioning of the Swan-Ganz catheter, now terminating in the region of the main pulmonary artery.

Interval decrease in extent of pulmonary edema, and probable slight decrease in size of a moderate layering left pleural effusion with associated improving aeration in the left lower lobe.
