Endotracheal tube, enteric tube, and right PICC tube are appropriately positioned. A right pleural effusion is small and left lung base is incompletely imaged, although there is likely a small pleural effusion there is well. Heterogeneous opacities in the right upper and lower lung may indicate multifocal infection. No pneumothorax.
