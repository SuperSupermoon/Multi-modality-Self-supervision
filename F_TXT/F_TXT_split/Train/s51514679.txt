AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained seven hours earlier during the same day. The ostomy is in place and position its appears to have adjusted since preceding study. Position of previously described right internal jugular approach wide-bore double-lumen catheter unchanged, the same holds for the left subclavian line. No pneumothorax is present. The previously described bilateral patchy parenchymal densities remain rather unchanged. Diffuse haze over right-sided hemithorax again interpreted as representing pleural effusion layering in the posterior compartments. Total subcapital right humerus fracture as before.
