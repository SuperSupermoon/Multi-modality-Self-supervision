AP chest compared to ___, 2:54 a.m. and ___: Previous left lower lobe collapse has partially re-aerated. However the configuration of lucency in the left lower lung could also be a large cavity. Lateral film would be helpful in making the distinction. Right basal consolidation is definitely clearing, however. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. Left PIC line ends in the SVC. I discussed findings by telephone at 12:30 p.m. with the covering house officer.
