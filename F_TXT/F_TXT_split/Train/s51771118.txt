The right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. The right PICC line terminates in the low SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with left basilar subsegmental atelectasis are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is improved. An asymmetric subpleural opacity in the right upper lobe is less prominent today. The heart and mediastinum cannot be accurately assessed on this projection.
