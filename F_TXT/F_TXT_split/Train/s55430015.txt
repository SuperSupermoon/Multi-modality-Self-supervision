As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing free intraperitoneal air has completely resolved. The left central venous access line has been removed. Today's image shows the right pectoral Port-A-Cath. Mild cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumonia.
