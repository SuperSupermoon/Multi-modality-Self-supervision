A large right pleural effusion has increased. A small layering left pleural effusion with associated left basilar atelectasis has also increased. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Aortic arch calcifications are incidentally noted. The heart and mediastinum cannot be accurately assessed due to projection and obscuring pleural fluid.
