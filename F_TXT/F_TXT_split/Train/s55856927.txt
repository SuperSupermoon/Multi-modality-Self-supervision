AP chest compared to ___: Interval increase in the diameter of the heart and mediastinal and pulmonary vascular caliber suggests that worsening interstitial abnormality is due to asymmetric pulmonary edema. Small right pleural effusion is stable. ET tube is in standard position. Nasogastric tube passes at least as far as the upper esophagus, but I cannot locate whether all the side ports have been moved beyond the GE junction. In the setting of heart failure, worsening consolidation at the left lung base is difficult to distinguish pneumonia from progressive atelectasis. Findings were discussed with the resident caring for this patient at 1:00 p.m., 2 minutes after discovery.
