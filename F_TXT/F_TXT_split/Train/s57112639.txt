Mild cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta are similar to the recent CT. Patchy and linear bibasilar opacities are suggestive of atelectasis. Lungs are otherwise clear, and there is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Note is made of previous left axillary lymph node dissection. Multifocal skeletal metastases have been more fully assessed by the outside CT, along with intrathoracic lymphadenopathy.
