1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC, unchanged. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3.5 to 4 cm above the carina. Lung volumes remain somewhat diminished with streaky linear opacities predominantly at the left base, improved, likely reflecting residual subsegmental atelectasis. Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
