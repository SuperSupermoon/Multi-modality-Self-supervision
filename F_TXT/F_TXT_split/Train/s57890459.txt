Assessment is somewhat limited due to patient positioning and exclusion of the left costophrenic angle. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm, with tip off the inferior borders of the film. Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged. Multiple clips are noted projecting over the left lower hemi thorax. Mediastinal contour is otherwise unremarkable. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is likely present. Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. Infection or aspiration is not excluded. There may be small bilateral pleural effusions. No large pneumothorax is identified, though assessment is limited on this single supine view. No acutely displaced fractures are visualized.
