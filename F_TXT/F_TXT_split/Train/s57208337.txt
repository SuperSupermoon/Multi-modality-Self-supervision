There has been a substantial change in the contour of the descending thoracic aorta, which may have enlarged substantially, bulging laterally, since ___. Alternatively this could be pleural fluid collected against the mediastinum. An upright view is recommended for initial evaluation. I doubt that it is new left lower lobe collapse since there is no leftward mediastinal shift but that is another possibility. There is greater opacification in the right lower chest, probably increasing moderate right pleural effusion and worsening edema in the right mid and lower lung zones. Heart is mildly enlarged. Pneumo mediastinum or small medial pneumothorax are probably without clinical significance, since left pleural drain is still in place. Very severe subcutaneous emphysema appears to have worsened, although that determination is uncertain.
