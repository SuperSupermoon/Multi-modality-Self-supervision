The tracheostomy tube and the stent in the right main stem bronchus are again visualized. The aeration is slightly improved compared to the prior exam. There is minimal pulmonary vascular re-distribution but no overt pulmonary edema. There continues to be widening of the right paratracheal stripe, compatible with the patient's known mediastinal mass.
