There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 4.7 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. There is a nasogastric tube whose sideport is at the GE junction and could be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal placement. Heart size is upper limits of normal and stable. There is a left retrocardiac opacity and a small left-sided pleural effusion, unchanged. There is mild pulmonary interstitial edema, new. The opacity at the right base has increased and may represent developing infiltrate versus atelectasis. No pneumothoraces are seen.
