Patient rotation limits comparison of the cardiomediastinal contours, but note is again made of widening of the left mediastinal contour at the level of the aorticopulmonary window, possibly due to postoperative seroma adjacent to site of graft placement as reported on prior CT chest of ___, but difficult to assess radiographically. Attention to this region on a nonrotated chest radiograph would allow more accurate comparison to previous chest radiographs. Alternatively, CT could be considered. Moderate right pleural effusion is new, and small left pleural effusion has slightly increased, with adjacent bibasilar atelectasis and/or consolidation. No visible pneumothorax.
