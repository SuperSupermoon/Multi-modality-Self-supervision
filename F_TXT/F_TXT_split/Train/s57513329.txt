1. Endotracheal tube, left subclavian PICC line and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. The left pleural pigtail catheter and the left large-bore chest tube remain in place. There is persistent retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis. Right lung remains clear and the left upper and mid lung are grossly clear. There is some loculated air at the left base, although the amount has decreased since the prior study. No pulmonary edema. Stable post-operative cardiac and mediastinal contour status post median sternotomy for CABG. Left lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema likely related to recent chest tube placement.
