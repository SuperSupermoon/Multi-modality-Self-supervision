Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained. Pulmonary vascular engorgement and increased interstitial abnormalities are consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema with likely accompanied bilateral pleural effusions. Left retrocardiac and right basilar opacities in this setting could reflect asymmetric edema or atelectasis, however an infectious process cannot entirely be excluded. The heart is top-normal in size.
