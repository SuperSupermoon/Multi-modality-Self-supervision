Patient has had sternotomy for CABG in the past few weeks. The second from the bottom sternotomy wire is difficult to see and might be fractured, though not displaced, readily evaluated by physical examination of surgical wound. There is no pneumothorax, pulmonary edema or upper mediastinal widening. The extent of cardiomegaly and postoperative change are difficult to assess because of lordotic positioning and mediastinal fat. The left basal pleural interface is now obscured, perhaps another artifact of patient position, but particularly because the lateral view on ___ showed left basal atelectasis and pleural effusion, and there is mild leftward shift of the heart, I strongly recommend conventional ___ and Lateral views to look for left lower lobe collapse.
