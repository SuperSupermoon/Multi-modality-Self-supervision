Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there has been interval placement of a left pleural drainage catheter. The left pleural effusion appears minimally decreased in size with decreased, adjacent compressive atelectasis. There is probably a small right pleural effusion. The lungs are otherwise expanded and clear without focal consolidation. No pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.
