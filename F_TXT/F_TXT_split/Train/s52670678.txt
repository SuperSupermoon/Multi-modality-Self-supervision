Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Spiculated right hilar mass is again seen, relatively stable as compared to the prior study. Patchy left lower lung opacity is seen, which could be due to infection. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle and there may be a trace pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
