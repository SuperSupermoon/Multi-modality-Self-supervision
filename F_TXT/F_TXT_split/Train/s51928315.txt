Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance, and indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. Worsening left retrocardiac opacity is probably a combination of atelectasis and effusion. Patchy and linear right lower lobe opacity is also likely due to atelectasis, but coexisting aspiration is possible in both lower lobes. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged, and there is no visible pneumothorax.
