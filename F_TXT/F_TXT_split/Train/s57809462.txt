The Impella support device now has its tip projecting over the more proximal aspect of the right ventricle being retracted approximately 6 cm since the previous study. The femoral Swan-Ganz catheter is unchanged in position. Interval appearance of streaky opacities at the right base likely reflectsing atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. No pulmonary edema. No large effusions. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
