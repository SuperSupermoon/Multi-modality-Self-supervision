Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. Left subclavian central line has its tip in the mid-to-distal SVC, unchanged. There are layering bilateral effusions with associated bibasilar opacities most likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There is a more focal patchy opacity at the right medial upper lobe felt to be related to degenerative changes involving the first costochondral joint rather than a developing airspace consolidation. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the presence of the layering effusions and relatively lower lung volumes.
