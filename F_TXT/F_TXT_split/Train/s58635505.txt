The heart size is mildly enlarged. Aortic knob is calcified. Perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness is compatible with mild pulmonary edema. More focal patchy opacity in the right lung base may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema but an area of infection or aspiration is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Contrast material is noted within the colon.
