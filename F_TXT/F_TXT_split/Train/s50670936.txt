An endotracheal tube is present, 6.3 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is present with the tip in the stomach, though the side port is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. Since the prior exam, there is slightly increased linear opacification at the left base. Other scattered basilar opacities are unchanged. These most likely represent atelectasis. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The known left first rib fracture is better appreciated on the CT of the torso.
