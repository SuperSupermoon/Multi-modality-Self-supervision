AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study dated ___. An NG tube can be identified, seen to reach well into the fundus of the stomach including its side port. In preceding examination, an NG tube was already identified. It is unclear whether this has been an exchange of tubes or if the old tube remains. Comparing the chest findings, it can be said that the previously identified bilateral patchy densities suspicious for infectious process or local edema have cleared up or less prominent now. The pulmonary vascular pattern still shows criteria suggestive of fluid overload with distended vessel and perivascular haze. No pneumothorax can be identified. The right-sided internal jugular approach central venous line remains in unchanged appropriate position.
