The enteric tube appears to terminate in the distal esophagus, proximal stomach and must be advanced. The lung volumes are low. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. In addition to a spread background of fine reticular abnormality, right greater than left, which appears slightly worse compared to the prior exam, there appears to be interval worsening of the mid right lung and left perihilar focal consolidations. No pneumothorax is identified. There is a small right pleural effusion. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
