As compared to the previous radiograph performed at 11:58 there are new relatively widespread diffuse predominantly interstitial parenchymal opacities on the left these opacities might reflect an increase in severity of the pre-existing predominantly interstitial pulmonary edema but might also could be an independent new parenchymal process, for example caused by infection, aspiration, or pulmonary hemorrhage. The pre-existing bilateral small pleural effusions as well as the retrocardiac atelectasis and the moderate cardiomegaly are unchanged. A short term radiographic followup should be performed after diuresis.
