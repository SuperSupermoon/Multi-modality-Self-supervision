Single frontal AP chest radiograph demonstrates mild tracheal narrowing at the thoracic inlet unchanged since CT 2 days prior. The lungs are fully expanded and clear. No retrocardiac opacity. The pleural surfaces are normal without large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The costophrenic angles are not fully included on this study. Heart size, mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable. Visualized osseous structures are notable for a surgical screw in the left scapula.
