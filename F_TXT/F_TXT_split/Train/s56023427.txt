Lung volumes have decreased in the interim. Confluent left lower lung and retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms, silhouetting of the lower aspect of the right heart border as well as the left hemidiaphragm is new. A left pleural effusion is small. The heart size is probably overall unchanged and moderately enlarged, even for this AP projection. Central pulmonary vessels are congested. Pulmonary edema is mild-to-moderate. No pneumothorax.
