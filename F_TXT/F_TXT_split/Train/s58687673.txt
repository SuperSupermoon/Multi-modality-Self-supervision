A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. Left-sided PICC line terminates in the low SVC. Lung volumes are low. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. Widening of the superior mediastinum is likelye due to prominent vessels. Left retrocardiac opacity and left greater than right small pleural effusions are unchanged. No new consolidation to explain decreased breath sounds at right base. Aortic arch calcifications are unchanged. A Dahboff tube has been removed.
