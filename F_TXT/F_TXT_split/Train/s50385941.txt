Right apical pneumothorax is tiny if any. An upper thoracostomy tube is still in place. Postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal following esophagectomy and pull-up. Heart is mildly enlarged, exaggerated by very low lung volumes, and unchanged. Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened. The upper lungs are grossly clear. Pleural effusions are probably small. An upper enteric drain descends in the midline to the level of the diaphragm. Right internal jugular line ends in the upper SVC. Mediastinal drains in place. An epidural infusion catheter coursing over the spine should not be mistaken for a mediastinal drain.
