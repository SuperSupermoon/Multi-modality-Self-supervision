The right-sided PICC tip is at lower SVC. The multifocal lung consolidation in the left lung persists but has improved in the left mid lung and unchanged in the left lower lung. Right lower lung opacities due to combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion is minimally worse than before. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Increased retrocardiac density reflects combination of atelectasis and consolidation and is similar in appearance to prior radiograph. Mild left pleural effusion is unchanged.
