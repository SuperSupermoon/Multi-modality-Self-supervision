The heart is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus and flattening of the hemidiaphragmatic contour suggest a small pleural effusion. Retrocardiac opacity is nonspecific. On the prior study, there was a known mass that may partly account for this appearance, but associated atelectasis or superimposed pneumonia are not excluded.
