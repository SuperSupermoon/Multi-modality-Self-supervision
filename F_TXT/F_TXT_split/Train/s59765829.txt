As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left chest tube after nodule resection. The tube is in correct position. There is no evidence of recurrent pneumothorax. However, air in the left lateral soft tissues is seen. Bilaterally, areas of atelectasis are seen. These are likely to be caused by the post-surgical situation. They are more severe on the right than on the left. Moderate cardiomegaly with mild overhydration. No pleural effusions.
