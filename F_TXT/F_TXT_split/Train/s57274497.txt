Interval placement of bilateral chest tubes. Persistent small right hand moderate left pneumothoraces without midline shift. A right apical cap is again seen as well as marked right mediastinal widening. Right lung and retrocardiac opacities correspond to pulmonary contusions seen on CT. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.7 cm above the carina. Previously described fractures are grossly unchanged.
