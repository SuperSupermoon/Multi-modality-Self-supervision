A left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Median sternotomy wires appear intact. Interval placement of a Dobhoff tube with the tip terminating in the stomach. Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar contours. Interval improvement in left basilar opacity may reflect improving basilar atelectasis. Stable right apical opacity likely reflects pleural thickening in the setting of prior pneumothorax. Recommend follow-up chest radiograph in 3 months to assess stability of presumed right apical pleural thickening.
