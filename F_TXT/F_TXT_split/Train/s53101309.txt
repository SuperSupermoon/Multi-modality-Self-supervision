Left PICC tip is in the mid-SVC. Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by the projection. There has been markedly improved, almost completely resolved opacities in the left lung. Minimal opacities remain in the retrocardiac region consistent with resolving atelectasis or aspiration. In the right lower lobe, there are persistent minimal opacities. This could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. If any, there is a small right effusion.
