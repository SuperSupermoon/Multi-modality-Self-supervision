The tip of the ET tube is located approximately 6.7 cm above the carina just at the thoracic inlet. The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter appears to extend just beyond the right descending pulmonary artery at the level of the right middle lobe pulmonary artery. The tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump appears high, likely at the level of the aortic arch. A nasogastric tube is present but its tip courses out of the field of view of exam. There are severe bilateral patchy opacities compatible with pulmonary edema. The mediastinal veins are distended compatible with cardiogenic shock. There are likely bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.
