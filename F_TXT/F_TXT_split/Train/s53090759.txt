Frontal radiograph of the chest shows a new right pleural catheter which is overlying the lung parenchyma. In the interim, there has been an interval improvement in the right pneumothorax with significant apical and medial components still visible. Lung volumes remain low, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature and cardiac contour. No left pneumothorax.
