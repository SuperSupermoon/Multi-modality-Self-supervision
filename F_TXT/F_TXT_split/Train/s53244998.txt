AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the portable frontal view of the trauma examination of ___. No significant new abnormalities are seen. As before, there is evidence of rather advanced emphysematous changes in the apical areas of both lungs. A torso CT, which has been performed during the latest examination interval, demonstrated a mass lesion in the right upper lobe. The latter cannot be seen with certainty on this portable chest examination, but its further workup should be performed as recommended on the CT.
