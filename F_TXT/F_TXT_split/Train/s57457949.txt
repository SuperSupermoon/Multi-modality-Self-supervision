AP chest compared to pre-operative chest CT on ___: There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or mediastinal widening. The large lesion in the right mid lung is grossly comparable to its appearance of the pre-bronchoscopy chest CT, which also showed right middle lobe atelectasis, probably not present on this study, which shows right basal atelectasis instead. Heart size is top normal. Left lung is clear.
