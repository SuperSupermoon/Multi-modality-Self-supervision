Compared to the prior study, the ET tube and right-sided chest tube are unchanged. There is increased opacity in both lungs compatible with worsening of the pulmonary edema superimposed on the interstitial fibrosis. There are dense bilateral lower lobe infiltrates that have increased in the interval. There continues to be alveolar edema. An underlying infectious process cannot be excluded.
