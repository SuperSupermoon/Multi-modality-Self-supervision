A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the upper-to-mid superior vena cava. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate diffuse interstitial abnormality appears new. There is persistent patchy opacity in the left retrocardiac area with air bronchograms. There is likely a small pleural effusion on the left, but no convincing evidence for one on the right.
