Right Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the right atrium and SVC. Large right hydro pneumothorax is re- demonstrated with interval decrease in amount of fluid in the right hemi thorax. There is complete collapse of the right lung with continued leftward shift of mediastinal structures, as seen previously. Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of the large right pleural effusion. There continued diffuse streaky and patchy opacities within the left mid and lower lung fields, worse in the interval, suggestive of worsening aspiration pneumonia. No left-sided pneumothorax or large left pleural effusion is demonstrated however the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field-of-view. A stent is noted within the splenic flexure with a narrowing of the stent lumen in the mid portion.
