Comparison is made to the prior study from ___. There is a right-sided central venous line with the distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. There is a feeding tube whose distal tip is in the fundus of the stomach. The side port is at the GE junction and this could be advanced 10 cm for more optimal placement. There is left ventricular prominence which is stable. The lungs are grossly clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusions or signs for overt pulmonary edema. There is mild atelectasis at the lung bases. No pneumothoraces are seen.
