Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC. A left central venous catheter tip terminates in the upper SVC. Tracheostomy tube tip terminates approximately 3.3 cm from the carina. Lung volumes remain low. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. There is retrocardiac opacity which could reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen on this supine exam. Mild S-shaped scoliosis is re- demonstrated within the thoracolumbar spine.
