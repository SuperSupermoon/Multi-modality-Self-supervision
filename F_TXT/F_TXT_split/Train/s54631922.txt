The findings on the chest CT ___, possible pneumonia left upper lobe, had no corresponding abnormality on the concurrent chest radiograph. There is no abnormality in the lungs on today's radiograph either. The abnormality could therefore still be present, but there is no indication that it progressed, and prospectively I would not read today's chest radiograph as suggestive of pneumonia. Heart is normal size, exaggerated by large mediastinal fat collection. There is no pleural abnormality. Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
