1. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach but the sideport may be close to the gastroesophageal junction. Clinical correlation would be advised. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient rotation. There is a persistent opacity in the left lower lobe which could reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia should be considered. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
