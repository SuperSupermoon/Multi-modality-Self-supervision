There are low lung volumes. Obscuration of the left costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissue, although there may be a small pleural effusion. Mild bibasilar opacities are seen, which could be due to atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, but underlying infection or aspiration is not excluded. Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as compared to the prior study, more prominent as compared to ___, which likely in part relates to low lung volumes and differences in technique. A couple of small subtle rounded opacities project over the right mid lung are nonspecific, not well identified on the prior study earlier today, but may be present on a prior radiograph from ___. Suggest repeat with PA and lateral views with deeper inspiration when patient is able for better evaluation.
