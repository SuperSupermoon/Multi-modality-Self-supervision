Since the prior exam, the right central venous catheter has been removed. A left PICC is unchanged with the tip in the low SVC. An enteric tube is present with the tip in the stomach. The lung volumes have improved and the bibasilar consolidations have resolved since the prior exam. This is most consistent with resolved pulmonary edema. There is no consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
