CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 8:29 a.m., an NG tube has been placed. It appears to be coiled in the lower mediastinum, with the tip extending cephalad to lie above the level of the carina. It does not extend beyond the GE junction into the stomach. Again seen is cardiomegaly, with extensive opacities in both lungs. The opacities appear more pronounced and could reflect increasing CHF, but the appearance is likely accentuated by differences in technique. PICC line and cervical hardware unchanged. Findings called to the covering house officer at the time of discovery at 4:17 p.m. on the day of the exam (___ covered by ___) and discussed with Dr ___ shortly thereafter (___, phone).
