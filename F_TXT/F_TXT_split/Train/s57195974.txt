Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. Layering bilateral pleural effusions likely account for the lower lung opacities seen. There is also likely a component of compressive atelectasis. These findings are better assessed on the outside hospital CT and appear grossly stable. The mid and upper lungs appear well aerated. The overall heart size appears grossly within normal limits. Bony structures are intact.
