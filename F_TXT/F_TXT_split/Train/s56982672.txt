The quality of the examination is limited by a patient overlay. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position. Signs of mild fluid overload are present. Mild atelectasis at the left lung base as well as bilateral moderate pleural effusions are seen. There currently is no convincing evidence for a new parenchymal opacity representing pneumonia, but short-term radiographic followup should be performed.
