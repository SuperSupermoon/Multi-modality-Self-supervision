A trauma board slightly limits evaluation of this radiograph. The left costophrenic angle is excluded from this radiograph. The lungs are clear. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. There is no right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. The bony thorax is grossly intact. A ___-mm round density overlying the lateral aspect of the T7 vertebral body is likely within the patient's garment, although correlation with physical exam is recommended.
