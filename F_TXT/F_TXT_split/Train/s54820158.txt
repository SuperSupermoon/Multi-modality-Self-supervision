AP chest compared to ___: There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Lungs are grossly clear and heart size is normal. Right hilar enlargement has been seen before. This could be due to adenopathy or arterial distension by acute pulmonary embolus, but I do not see secondary signs of pulmonary vascular occlusion in the right lower lobe. Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by telephone at 3:50 p.m., when the findings were recognized.
