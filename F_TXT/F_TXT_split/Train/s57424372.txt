Large left and moderate right pleural effusion unchanged. Left lower lobe atelectasis is probably substantial. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged to the point of early pulmonary edema, but heart size is normal and mediastinal veins are not distended. No pneumothorax. Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC, right jugular line in the upper SVC, ET tube in standard placement, and esophageal drainage tube in the nondistended stomach.
