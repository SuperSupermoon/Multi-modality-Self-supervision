Right-sided pleural effusion is decreased after placement of right pleural catheter, which may have been withdrawn slightly as pigtail is partially external to the chest and not formed. Pulmonary opacities are slightly increased, particularly in the bilateral apices, compatible with superimposed pulmonary edema with unchanged dense left basal opacity at least in part reflecting atelectasis. Right PICC is in stable position. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen. The left costophrenic angle is excluded from view.
