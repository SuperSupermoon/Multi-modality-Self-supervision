The cardiac silhouette is normal. Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular structures. Increased opacity at right lung base could reflect atelectasis or early developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. However, there is no definite pneumonia. There is mild atelectasis at the left lung base. There is a probable small right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax identified. No overt pulmonary edema. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
