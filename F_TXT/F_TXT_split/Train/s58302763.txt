No previous images. There is mild prominence of the cardiac silhouette with mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The left hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle are not well seen. This could reflect some small effusion and atelectatic changes, or merely be a manifestation of anterior soft tissues. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
