The heart is normal in size. Multiple right-sided rib fractures are better appreciated on CT done at 14:58. There is a small right-sided pneumothorax. Scattered opacities throughout the right lung are consistent with extensive pulmonary contusion, again better seen on CT. The left lung appears clear.
