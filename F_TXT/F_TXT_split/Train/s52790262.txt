A single semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. Lung volumes are slightly low, decreased compared to the prior study. Left retrocardiac consolidative opacification and right lower lung patchy opacities are increased compared to the prior study, possibly secondary to atelectasis, although an infectious process could have a similar appearance. Mild perihilar fullness is suggestive of mild vascular congestion. The heart size is at the upper limits of normal size. The mediastinal contours are normal. Small bilateral pleural effusions are suspected. There is no pneumothorax.
