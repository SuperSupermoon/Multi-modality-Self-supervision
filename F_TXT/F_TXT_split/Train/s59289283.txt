Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates an ET tube with tip extending to 6 cm above the carina. Prominent cardiac silhouette is likely accentuated by AP technique. Dense retrocardiac opacity is redemonstrated, but somewhat less pronounced as compared to one day prior, which may reflect slight improvement in dependent atelectasis. The upper lungs remain lucent, consistent with moderate-to-severe emphysema correlated with prior CT. There is no pneumothorax. There is no right pleural effusion. A small left pleural effusion is present.
