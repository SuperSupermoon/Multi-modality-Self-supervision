Compared with the film from ___ at 16:05, the PICC line tip has been repositioned and now overlies the proximal/mid SVC. Unchanged position of a right IJ sheath, with distal tip projecting over the proximal/mid mid SVC. Mediastinal drains, left and question right chest tubes are again seen. . The patient is status post anatomy, with mediastinal clips. Stable cardiomediastinal contours are enlarged, but stable. Mild CHF is similar to the prior study.
