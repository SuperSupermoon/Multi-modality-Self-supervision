The newly placed pigtail catheter projects over the right lateral hemithorax with apparent improvement in the right pneumothorax, now not readily appreciable. Lung volumes are low. Bilateral diffuse patchy opacities, more prominent on the right, are more conspicuous and increased in number and size from at least ___, but somewhat similar dated ___. Day-to-day changes likely reflect edema, but persistent opacities likely reflect underlying infection and scarring, better seen on CT. No definite pleural effusion. The heart is normal in size.
