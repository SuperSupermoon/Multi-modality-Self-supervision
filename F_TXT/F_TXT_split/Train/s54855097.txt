Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval decrease in right-sided pleural effusion, now small. Residual linear opacification within the right lower lung likely represents atelectasis. Similar findings are noted on the left. Stable right upper lung mass better evaluated on recent CT chest. Otherwise, cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
