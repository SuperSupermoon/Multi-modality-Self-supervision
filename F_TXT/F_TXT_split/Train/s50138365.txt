As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in lung density at the right lung base, potentially caused by a small pleural effusion. The pre-existing left retrocardiac atelectasis and the signs suggesting minimal fluid overload are constant. Unchanged monitoring and support devices, including the endotracheal tube, unchanged sternal wires and valvular repair. No evidence of pneumothorax.
