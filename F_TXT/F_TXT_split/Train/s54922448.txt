As compared to the previous radiograph, the opacities in the right lung are virtually unchanged. On the left, the pre-existing basolateral consolidation has decreased in severity, so that the lung parenchyma, notably in the mid lung zones, appears better ventilated than on the previous image. Minor atelectasis at the lung bases, caused by a small left pleural effusion, is still present. A right PICC line is in unchanged position. The tip projects over the lower SVC.
