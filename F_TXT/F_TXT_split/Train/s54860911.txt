A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Lung volumes are very low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm persists. The pulmonary vasculature is indistinct suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion. The heart is mildly enlarged. There may be a small left effusion. Right basilar atelectasis is unchanged. Increased opacity at the left lung base may be atelectasis or infection. There is no definite pneumothorax. The tracheostomy tube has been removed in the interim.
