Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate well expanded lungs. There are no rib fractures identified on this exam. There is slight left basilar atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion noted. A tube is seen overlying the heart shadow, presumably related to recent pericardiocentesis. The heart silhouette is large but there are no signs of vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax seen on this exam. Mediastinum is unremarkable.
