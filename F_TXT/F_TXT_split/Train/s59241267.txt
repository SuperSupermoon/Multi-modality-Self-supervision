As compared to a previous radiograph from ___, there is no relevant change. The lung volumes are relatively large but no flattening of the hemidiaphragms is seen. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. However, the right hilus is large and the right paramediastinal area is radiodense. A zone of asymmetrical right apical thickening is also seen. In the past history of the patient, there is no report of radiation or a pathologic process in the right lung. Therefore, the enlargement of the right hilus and the changes in the right paramediastinal lung areas should undergo further evaluation by CT.
