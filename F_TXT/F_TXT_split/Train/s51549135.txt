AP chest compared to ___: Severe nearly confluent and symmetric bilateral pulmonary opacification obscures what were smaller foci of probable pneumonia in the right mid lung laterally. The new process, accompanied by mild mediastinal vascular engorgement is probably edema, not necessarily cardiogenic, or diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. I doubt that pneumonia would develop and coalesce so quickly. Heart size is top normal. Pleural effusions are small if any.
