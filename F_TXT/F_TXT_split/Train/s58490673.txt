The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable, allowing for technique. The hila are mildly prominent. There is no pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely. The lungs are well-expanded with increased number and indistinctness of interstitial markings, consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Increased opacity at the left base may reflect atelectasis.
