As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously completely atelectatic left lung has obviously reexpanded in part. A moderate left pleural effusion is seen at the bases of the left hemithorax. The upper and mid third of the left lung is reasonably well ventilated. The monitoring and support devices are constant. Constant appearance of the cardiac silhouette. No change in appearance of the right lung.
