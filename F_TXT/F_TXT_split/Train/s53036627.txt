The enteric tube traverses the diaphragm into the left upper quadrant and its tip is not visualized. The ETT has since been removed. Lung volumes remain low. Asymmetric opacity of the right lower lung is perhaps minimally improved and may reflect atelectasis and small right pleural effusion. The heart is top-normal in size. No pneumothorax.
