As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Low lung volumes. Massive cardiomegaly with a likely small pleural effusion on the left and a substantial retrocardiac atelectasis. The subtle parenchymal opacities at the right lung base are also unchanged. Unchanged monitoring and support devices. No new parenchymal opacities, no pneumothorax.
