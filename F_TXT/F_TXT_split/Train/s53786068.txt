Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates persistent cardiomegaly, which is likely accentuated by AP technique. There is apparent widening of the mediastinum, more pronounced as compared to prior exam, which could be attributed to potentially semi-supine positioning accentuating mediastinal fat. The lungs are reasonably aerated allowing for underpenetration. There is no pneumothorax, large effusion, or congestion. There is ill defined retrocardiac opacity, which likely represents atelectasis.
