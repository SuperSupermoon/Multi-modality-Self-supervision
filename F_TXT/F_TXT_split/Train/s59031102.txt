The left internal jugular venous catheter line has been removed in the interim. A left subclavian approach PICC tip has been retracted in the interim and now projects over expected region of the cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes are low with bronchovascular crowding. Linear bandlike opacity projecting over the left mid lung is probably platelike atelectasis and/or scarring, seen on the prior exam and unchanged. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema. No definite focal consolidation.
