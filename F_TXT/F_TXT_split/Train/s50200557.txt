Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube 4 cm above the carina. Interval worsening of linear opacity at the right base and more patchy opacity at the left base. These findings may reflect bibasilar atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged, given differences in technique. Possible small layering effusions. Apparent irregularity of the right fifth anterolateral rib, which may be projectional or possibly indicate remote trauma. Clinical correlation is advised.
