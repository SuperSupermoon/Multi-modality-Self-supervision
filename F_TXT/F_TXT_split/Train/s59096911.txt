There is persistent opacification of the left hemithorax with leftward mediastinal shift suggesting collapse of the left lower lobe. A large left pleural effusion is unchanged. Compared with the immediate prior study of ___ at 22:23, there is slightly improved aeration of the left mainstem bronchus as well as slightly increased air in the left lung field. However, the partially visualized left-sided airways appear abnormal, suggesting widespread bronchiectasis. The pulmonary edema in the right lung appears slightly improved, but there abnormal opacities throughout the right lung, suggesting underlying chronic pulmonary disease. If no cross-sectional imaging has been performed to date (none is available for review at this time), CT is recommended for further evaluation of any underlying parenchymal process. The endotracheal tube and enteric tube are in unchanged standard position. There are multilevel age indeterminate vertebral compression fractures of the visualized thoracic spine.
