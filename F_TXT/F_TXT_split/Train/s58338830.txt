Right basilar opacity is in part due to pleural effusion which may be partially loculated and appears larger when compared to prior. Pleural-based catheter is in unchanged position compared to prior. There may also be a small left pleural effusion given blunting of left costophrenic angle. Left upper lung opacity has not significantly changed since priors. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted. Left upper extremity vascular stent is visualized.
