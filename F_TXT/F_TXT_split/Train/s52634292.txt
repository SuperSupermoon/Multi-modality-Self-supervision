As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously placed left chest tube was removed. There is a persistent small pneumothorax at the left lung apex, but no evidence of tension. On the right, the chest tube is in unchanged position. Also unchanged is the right pectoral Port-A-Cath and the nasogastric tube. Free air continues to be visible in the abdomen. The lung bases appear bilaterally minimally better ventilated; otherwise, there is no relevant change in appearance of the lung parenchyma.
