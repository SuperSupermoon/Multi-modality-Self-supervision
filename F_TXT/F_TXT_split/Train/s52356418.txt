AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Mostly interval changes over the past several days have been due to the fluctuations in pulmonary edema in the setting of severe pneumonia. That is the case this morning, with a very slight increase in edema in the left mid lung and right lower lung. Very extensive pneumonia has not changed appreciably, particularly the largest focus in the right upper lobe. Heart size is obscured. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements. An upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
