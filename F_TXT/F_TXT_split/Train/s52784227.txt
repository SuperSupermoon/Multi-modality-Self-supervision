1. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube now has its tip projecting over the stomach. Left internal jugular central line with its tip in the proximal SVC. Patient is status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac enlargement and stable mediastinal contours. There continues to be retrocardiac consolidation, which may reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis given the associated layering pleural effusion. There is a slight interval improvement in the bilateral airspace process suggesting resolving pulmonary edema. More focal airspace consolidation is again seen in the left upper-to-mid lung, which would be concerning for an infectious process, although this also could be seen in the setting of asymmetric pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation is advised. Degenerative changes are seen involving the right glenohumeral joint and there is destruction or loss of the left humeral head, possibly related to remote trauma with resorption or previous surgical resection.
