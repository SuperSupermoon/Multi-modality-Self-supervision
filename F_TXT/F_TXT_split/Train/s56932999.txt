Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Tubes and lines are in unchanged position. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. The patient continues to be in interstitial pulmonary edema with no substantial change since the prior study, associated with bilateral pleural effusions. No appreciable pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is demonstrated within the limitations of this study technique. Besides the right lower paracardiac area, the lucency is seen that potentially might reflect loculation of air. If clinically warranted, correlation with chest CT dedicated to this area might be considered. This appearance is more prominent than back on ___ and ___ radiographs, although potentially might reflect sparing of the lung parenchyma as well.
