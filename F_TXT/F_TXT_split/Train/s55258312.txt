There no prior chest radiographs available. Heart size is normal. Pulmonary vascular caliber is mildly enlarged in the upper lobes, but there is no evidence of mediastinal venous engorgement. Hazy opacification in the lower lungs is probably a combination of mild edema, dependent atelectasis and small pleural effusions.
