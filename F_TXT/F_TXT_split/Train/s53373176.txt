In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right chest tube has been pulled back with the tip overlying the spine. No evidence of pneumothorax. On the left, there appears to be mild increase in the degree of pneumothorax along the lateral chest wall extending downward to produce a deep sulcus sign. Otherwise, little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
