As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular vein catheter is better visualized. It is now apparent that the catheter tip projects over the right atrium. For position in the mid-to-lower SVC, the catheter should be pulled back by approximately 6-7 cm. The course of the newly inserted nasogastric tube is unremarkable. The tip projects over the proximal parts of the stomach, as the tube is coiled in the stomach. The course of the tube, however, is normal. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The position of the endotracheal tube and the severity of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, combined to pleural effusions, are constant.
