As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is noted. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially due to a small left pleural effusion. Mild atelectasis at the left and the right lung base. Minimal perihilar atelectatic opacity around the left hilus. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema. Normal course of the left PICC line, with the tip projecting over the mid SVC.
