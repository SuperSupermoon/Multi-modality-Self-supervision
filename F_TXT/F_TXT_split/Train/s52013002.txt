As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right-sided PICC line. The course of the line is unremarkable, tip of the line projects over the mid SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The bilateral pleural effusions persist. The areas of parenchymal opacities and consolidation, likely reflecting pneumonia, have decreased in extent and severity. The size of the cardiac silhouette is minimally larger than on the previous image.
