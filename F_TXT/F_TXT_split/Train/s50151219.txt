No prior studies available for comparison. Cardiomegaly is substantial, diffuse. Mitral valve is replaced. Post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable. There is most likely present bilateral pleural effusion. Perihilar vascular engorgement is noted as well as bilateral mid lung opacities. They might reflect the presence of pulmonary edema, but infectious process or aspiration is another possibility. There is no pneumothorax.
