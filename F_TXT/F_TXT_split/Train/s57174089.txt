A right Pleurx catheter has been placed in the interim with the tip directed inferomedially. Increased airspace opacities of the right lower lung are thought to reflect postprocedure changes. Additionally, subcutaneous emphysema is present. A small right pleural effusion persists. There is a right subpulmonic pneumothorax. A nodule seen in the right mid lung measures 2.2 cm and is largely unchanged from prior studies. The left lung is clear. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. Dense calcifications are seen throughout the aorta.
