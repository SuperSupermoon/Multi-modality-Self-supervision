The lungs are well inflated. There are conspicuous interstitial markings and vascular cephalization with bilateral hilar engorgement. Of note, hilar lymphadenopathy documented in recent CT is also contributing to the hilar conspicuity. Moderate cardiomegaly appears slightly worsened than in prior exam although AP projection hinders accurate comparison. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
