Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest provided. As seen on prior exam, an NG tube is seen terminating in the lower chest with contrast residua seen within the distal aspect of the gastric pull-through. In this patient with diaphragmatic hernias, better assessed on prior CT, air-filled loops of colon project over the left lung base. The mid-to-upper lungs remain grossly clear. No large effusions are detected. The heart size is difficult to assess due to subjacent hernia. No pneumothorax.
