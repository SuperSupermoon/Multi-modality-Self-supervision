In comparison with the recent studies, there is probably little change in the opacification at the right base. Given the prominence of markings on the left, this appearance could reflect pulmonary vascular congestion with possible superimposed pneumonia especially at the right base. The left hemidiaphragm is poorly seen medially, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Blunting of the costophrenic angle could reflect layering pleural effusion, possibly bilaterally. Monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
