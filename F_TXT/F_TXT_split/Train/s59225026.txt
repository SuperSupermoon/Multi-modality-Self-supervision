An endotracheal tube and feeding tube have been removed since the prior study. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of the mid SVC and unchanged. The right lung is clear. There is a retrocardiac opacity at the base of the left lung, which is similar in appearance to the prior study. The heart is enlarged and the hilar contours are normal. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is a very small left pleural effusion.
