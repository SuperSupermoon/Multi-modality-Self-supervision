Interval increase in size of a left pleural effusion which likely has a loculated component laterally. There is stable retrocardiac consolidation consistent with compressive lower lobe atelectasis. Overall, there is increasing pulmonary vascular indistinctness and worsening opacity in the left mid lung favoring asymmetric pulmonary edema, athough an infectious process in the left mid lung should also be considered. Clinical correlation is recommended. Status post median sternotomy. Given patient rotation, cardiac and mediastinal contours are essentially stable. No pneumothorax.
