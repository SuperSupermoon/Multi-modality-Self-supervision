Frontal view of the chest provided with portable AP technique. An NG tube is seen coursing inferiorly, though the tip is not clearly visualized. Midline sternotomy wires are noted. The lung volumes are markedly low with bibasilar atelectasis. The possibility of aspiration is difficult to exclude given the presence of perihilar opacity. Otherwise, no change.
