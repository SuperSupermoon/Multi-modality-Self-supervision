Compared to the prior film, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is a moderate left effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is also minimal blunting at the right costophrenic angle consistent with a small right pleural effusion, very slightly larger. CHF may be very slightly improved.
