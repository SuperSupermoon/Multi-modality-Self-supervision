Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The ET tube tip is 5.4 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. Left retrocardiac opacity most likely reflects known hiatal hernia. There is no pneumothorax. Small amount of left pleural effusion and left basal minimal atelectasis are most likely present.
