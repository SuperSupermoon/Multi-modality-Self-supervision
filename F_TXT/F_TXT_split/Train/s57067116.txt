CHEST, 1 PORTABLE VW Compared with ___, an NG tube has been placed. The tip and side port lie beneath the diaphragm. The tip overlies the lower portion of the gastric body. A double contour over the right hemidiaphragm laterally appears to relate to undulation of the hemidiaphragm interfacing with the lung and is therefore of doubtful clinical significance. No acute pulmonary process identified. Incidental note made of asymmetry of the clavicular heads.
