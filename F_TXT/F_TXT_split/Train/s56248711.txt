1. Lung volumes are low with patchy opacity in the left costophrenic angle, which may reflect scarring or subsegmental atelectasis. No focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in technique and positioning between studies. Please note that the essentially unremarkable chest film does not exclude pulmonary embolism, so if this remains of clinical concern, further imaging evaluation with CT should be considered.
