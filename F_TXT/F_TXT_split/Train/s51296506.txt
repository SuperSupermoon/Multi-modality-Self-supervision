CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW OBTAINED PORTABLY. No pneumothorax is detected. Compared with ___ at 9:51 a.m., the upper zone vessels are slightly more prior prominent and could reflect slight fluid overload. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is background COPD, with extensive parenchymal scarring as well as bilateral calcified pleural plaques. There is a small right effusion and minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle which are unchanged. The reported rib fracture is not readily apparent radiographically.
