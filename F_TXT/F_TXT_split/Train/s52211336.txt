Lung volumes are low. There is increased right pleural effusion, persistent right lower lobe atelectasis, and new right middle lobe atelectasis. Pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema have improved minimally. Mediastinal widening is consistent with elevated central venous pressures. Stable moderate cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax. The right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the distal SVC. There is an enteric tube extending into the stomach with distal tip not visualized. The ET tube is positioned at the thoracic inlet 6 cm above the carina. For more secure positioning, the ET tube could be advanced 2cm.
