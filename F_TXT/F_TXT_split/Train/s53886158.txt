As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Massive soft tissue density structures at the level of the right-sided mediastinum and right hilus. Opacifications of the right basal hemi thorax, likely caused by a combination of atelectasis, effusion and parenchymal collapse. Unchanged normal appearance of the left heart border and of the left hemithorax.
