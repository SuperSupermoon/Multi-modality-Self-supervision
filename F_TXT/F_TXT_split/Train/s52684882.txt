Comparison is made with prior study performed 9 hours earlier. Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Bibasilar opacities, larger on the right side are grossly unchanged. These could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Right upper lobe opacity is unchanged, also worrisome for a focus of infection. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged, allowing for the difference in positioning of the patient.
