A new endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position approximately 4.5 cm from the carina. The nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of fields of view. Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower. There is moderate pulmonary edema, which is somewhat accentuated by the lower lung volumes, though likely worsened. Small pleural effusions are difficult to exclude. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal contours appears wider, which may be due to technique. The heart size remains mildly enlarged.
