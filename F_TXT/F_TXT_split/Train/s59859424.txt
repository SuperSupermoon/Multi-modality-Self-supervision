The patient is intubated, an endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.5 cm above the level the carina, this is unchanged compared to the prior study. A right-sided internal jugular Port-A-Cath is in-situ. The tip terminates in the distal SVC or right atrium, difficult to assess given the low lung volumes. There has been slight interval improvement in the left basilar atelectasis versus consolidation.
