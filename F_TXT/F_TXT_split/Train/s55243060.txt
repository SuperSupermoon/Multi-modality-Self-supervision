Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contours are similar, with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted, and widening of the superior mediastinum, likely due to low lung volumes, with rightward deviation of the trachea. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Chronic elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is again noted. Left basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Extensive glenohumeral joint degenerative changes are again seen bilaterally.
