AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes remain quite low and increase in pulmonary, hilar, and mediastinal vascular caliber suggests volume overload reflected in increased heart size as well, and at least a small right pleural effusion, but there is no pulmonary edema. Bilateral infrahilar consolidation is probably atelectasis. Nasogastric tube loops in a normal caliber stomach ending close to the pylorus. Large and small bowel are still severely distended and the wall is thickened by edema. No substantial pneumoperitoneum.
