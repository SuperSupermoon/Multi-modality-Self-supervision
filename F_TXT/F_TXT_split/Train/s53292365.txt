A right pleural catheter remains in place and there is a slightly smaller but persistent apical lateral pneumothorax. Overall, there is improving aeration at the right base with decrease in size of the pleural collection. The heart remains markedly enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. Opacity at the left base most likely reflects partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
