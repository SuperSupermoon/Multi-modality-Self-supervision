Single AP semi-erect portable view of the chest. There is persistent right base atelectasis and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm appears slightly increased. Left costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. Overall, there are low lung volumes and vascular congestion. Possible trace right pleural effusion with blunting of the right costophrenic angle persists. There is patchy left base opacity, which may be due to atelectasis, although developing consolidation is difficult to exclude. Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.
