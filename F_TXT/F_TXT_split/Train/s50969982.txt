There has been no improvement in the moderately severe interstitial abnormality throughout the left lung with greater coalescence on the right. Findings could be explained by pulmonary edema and concurrent right-sided pneumonia or even pulmonary hemorrhage. Heart is normal size and pleural effusions are small if any. The right PIC line still extends approximately 7 cm across the midline beyond the origin of the SVC. No pneumothorax.
