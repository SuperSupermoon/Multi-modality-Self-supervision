Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Mild pulmonary edema has minimally improved. Left perihilar consolidation, mainly in the left upper lobe, has minimally increased. Right lower lobe and lingular consolidations are grossly unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left side, have minimally increased. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated. Lines and tubes remain in unchanged positions with left PICC tip in the left brachiocephalic vein, ET tube tip 2.6 cm above the carina and NG tube tip out of view below the diaphragm.
