There are no previous studies available. Left chest tube is in place and there is a small apical pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, though this is accentuated by the scoliosis convex to the right. Opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural fluid. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the right base. There is some engorgement of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
