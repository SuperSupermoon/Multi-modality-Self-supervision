AP single portable AP chest view obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding AP and lateral chest examination with patient in sitting upright position dated ___. Densities on the right base are similar to what has been described on the preceding study. The patient now is in semi-upright position, the previously identified bilateral pleural effusions are layering posteriorly and creating a diffuse haze. They overshadow the basal pulmonary densities which are unlikely to have changed significantly. Lung mid field and upper areas do not show evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates and again there is no evidence of pneumothorax. The presence of barium contrast in the hiatal area is related to the patient's known distended esophagus.
