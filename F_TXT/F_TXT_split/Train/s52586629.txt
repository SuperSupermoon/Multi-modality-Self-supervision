Left chest tube remains in place, with a persistent small-to-moderate left apicolateral pneumothorax. The amount of pleural fluid has increased slightly in the lateral costophrenic sulcus region, and the basilar component of the left pneumothorax in this region has slightly decreased. Otherwise, no relevant change since the recent study of several hours earlier.
