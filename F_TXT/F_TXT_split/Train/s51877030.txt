Moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened, best appreciated in the right upper lobe. Left lower lobe is now completely airless, probably collapsed reflected in leftward mediastinal shift, and a small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are larger as well. Heart size is normal. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. A left PIC line ends in the mid SVC.
