AP chest compared to ___: Lungs fully expanded and clear. Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces. Upper enteric drainage tube would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. No pneumothorax, appreciable pleural effusion, or even pneumoperitoneum, although there is subcutaneous emphysema in both flanks, presumably the result of the recent surgery.
