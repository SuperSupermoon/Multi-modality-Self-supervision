In comparison to study of ___, is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vessels are not sharply seen and appear mildly engorged, consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The retrocardiac region is not well seen, raising the possibility of volume loss in the left lower lobe. No definite pneumonia is identified. However, in view of the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and prominence of vascular structures, it is impossible to exclude the possibility of a superimposed consolidation. If the condition of the patient would permit, a lateral view would be most helpful.
