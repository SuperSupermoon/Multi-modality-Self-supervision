Previous mediastinal widening has resolved, presumably a drained hematoma. Very severe subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and chest wall, is no less severe, while pneumomediastinum is much smaller. Relatively symmetric pulmonary opacification, presumably pulmonary edema, it is a little better today than on ___, clearing from more of the lung apices. Bilateral pleural effusions are presumed, stable on the right, decreased on the left. Heart is top-normal size. Left pleural drain and midline drain unchanged in location, allowing for differences in patient position. ET tube tip at the upper margin of the clavicles, with the chin flexed, no less in 6.5 cm from the carina, should be advanced 3 cm for more secure seating. Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter ends in the pulmonary outflow tract.
