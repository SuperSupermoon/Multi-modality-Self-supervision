SEVERE ENLARGEMENT OF THE CARDIAC SILHOUETTE IS STABLE. SMALL RIGHT PNEUMOTHORAX WITH APICAL AND BASAL COMPONENTS UNCHANGED, BECAUSE OF THE OVERLYING DEVICES I CANNOT TELL WHETHER IN ADDITION TO THE LARGE BORE RIGHT THORACOSTOMY TUBE THERE IS A NEW RIGHT BASAL PLEURAL DRAIN. SMALL LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION UNCHANGED. NO LEFT PNEUMOTHORAX. BIBASILAR ATELECTASIS IS SUBSTANTIAL, AND IT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXCLUDE CONSOLIDATION IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE.
