AP chest compared to ___: New widespread largely interstitial pulmonary abnormality, with some coalescence at the right lung base is most likely asymmetric edema by virtue of its wide extent. I cannot of course exclude pneumonia particularly due to large scale aspiration. Moderate right pleural effusion is larger. Large heart is stable, with a configuration suggesting substantial left atrial dilatation, pre-disposition to edema. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has increased as well. No pneumothorax. No endotracheal tube or central venous catheters seen.
