AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The patient remains intubated, ETT in unchanged position. The same holds for the right internal jugular as well as left subclavian approach central venous lines. Status post sternotomy, extensive large size stent structures in thoracic aortic arch area as well as evidence of mitral and tricuspid valve replacements are unchanged. Cardiomegaly as before. Lesser densities in the right hemithorax, mostly pleural space, suggest some regression of pleural effusion probably obtained by pigtail ending pleural catheter on the right base. No new pulmonary abnormalities are identified and no pneumothorax seen.
