A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph is obtained. There is no significant change in the middle and lower lobe pneumonia, better appreciated on recent CT. There is no increased pulmonary edema, new consolidation, or pneumothorax. Layering left pleural effusion has gotten slightly bigger. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
