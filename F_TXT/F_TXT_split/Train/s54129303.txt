The Swan-Ganz catheter has been pulled back slightly and the distal tip is at the confluence of the main and right pulmonary arteries. The tip of the right-sided PICC line is again seen in the right atrium and this could be pulled back several cm for more optimal placement. There is a left-sided pacemaker. Heart size is prominent. There is a left retrocardiac opacity and likely small left-sided pleural effusion. No pneumothoraces are seen.
