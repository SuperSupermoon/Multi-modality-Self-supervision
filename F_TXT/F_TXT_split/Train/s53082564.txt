Compare ___ radiograph, an endotracheal tube is in place, terminating 2 cm above the carinal. Additionally, the cuff is slightly over distended. Repositioning assessment of the cuff would be helpful for optimal placement. Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm beyond the field of view. Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours and also result in crowding of bronchovascular structures. Patchy bibasilar opacities probably represent atelectasis, but aspiration is an additional consideration.
