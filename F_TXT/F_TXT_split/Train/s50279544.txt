In comparison to the prior radiograph from several hours prior, lung volumes remain very low. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Endotracheal tube terminates 2.2 cm above the carina. Endotracheal tube cuff appears overinflated. ___ tube projects over the esophagus with tip below the diaphragm and excluded from the image. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Patchy bibasilar opacities, particularly in the left lower lung are unchanged, probably represent atelectasis. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
