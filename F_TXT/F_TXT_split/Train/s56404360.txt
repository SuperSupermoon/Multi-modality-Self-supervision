ET tube tip approximately 4.4 cm above the carina, at the level of the mid clavicular heads . NG tube not well seen through the lower mediastinum, though it appears to extend beneath the diaphragm, off the film. Right IJ central line is unchanged, with tip at cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax detected. Again seen are extensive nodular and confluent opacities in both lungs, most pronounced along the periphery of the right lung. Right and left costophrenic angles are both obscured, suggesting bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
