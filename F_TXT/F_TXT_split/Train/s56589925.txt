Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates top normal cardiac size, likely accentuated by AP technique and supine positioning. There is minimal unfolding of the thoracic aorta. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Despite slightly low lung volumes, the lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. No displaced osseous injury is evident.
