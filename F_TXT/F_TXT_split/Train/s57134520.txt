As compared to the previous radiograph, extent of the pleural effusions have slightly decreased. On the left, no effusion is visible. Also decreased are the multifocal parenchymal opacities. These, however, are still clearly present in both lungs. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No pneumothorax. The left internal jugular vein catheter has been removed in the interval.
