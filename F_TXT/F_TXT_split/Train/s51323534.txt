1. Bilateral pleural effusions, right much greater than left, do not appear to be significantly changed. Given that the patient was only imaged in the supine position, evaluation for loculation is not possible and if this remains of clinical concern, imaging in the decubitus or upright position would be advised. The aerated right upper lung and left upper and mid lungs demonstrate prominent vasculature which suggests mild interstitial edema. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac size cannot be assessed as it is obscured by the overlying pleural effusions. Calcification in the aortic knob consistent with atherosclerosis. Calcification of the aortic valve is also seen.
