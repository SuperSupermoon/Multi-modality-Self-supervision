Single portable view of the chest. The lungs are grossly clear noting linear left basilar opacity likely due to atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications seen in the aorta are again noted. Sclerosis projecting over the right humeral head which may represent avascular necrosis. No free intraperitoneal air identified.
