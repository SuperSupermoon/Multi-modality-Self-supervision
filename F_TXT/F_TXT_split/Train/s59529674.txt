Single portale view of the chest. There is suggestion of a left-sided pneumothorax seen with what appears to be a pleural line inferolaterally and superolaterally as well. There is lack of clear lung markings seen distal to this area. If amenable, repeat with patient in the radiology department is suggested to confirm. There is increased opacity at the left lung base potentially due to atelectasis, although infection cannot be entirely excluded. The right lung is grossly clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Tortuous thoracic aorta is identified.
