Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube tip is slightly high, 7.5 cm above the carina, could be advanced a couple of centimeters for more standard position. Other lines and tubes are in unchanged position. Biapical opacities have minimally increased on the right, likely improving atelectases. Left perihilar opacity also has improved, consistent with improving atelectasis. There is increased vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
