A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. The patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube follows the expected course, ending in the stomach which is distended with air. The right internal jugular catheter ends in the mid SVC and appears kinked on this single image. Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding with right basilar atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacity is likely due to atelectasis. There is no substantial effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. An imaged loop of small bowel is dilated to 6 cm.
