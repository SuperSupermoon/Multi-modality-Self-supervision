Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increased opacification of the right mid hemi thorax with obscuration of the right heart border consistent with obstruction of the right middle lobe. There is rightward deviation of the trachea. The left lung is clear, but appears hyperexpanded. The endotracheal tube ends 5.6 cm from the carina, and should be advanced for more secure seating. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view. There has been interval removal of the right-sided subclavian line. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
