Single supine portable view of the chest. Patient is rotated to the right. The lungs are grossly clear with interval resolution of a previously seen pulmonary edema. There is focal, likely pleural-based opacity projecting over the right lung base laterally, potentially due to loculated pleural fluid, especially given prior right-sided pleural catheter which is no longer visualized. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, noting a dual-lead pacing device. Gaseous distention of the stomach is identified. Degenerative changes seen at the shoulders bilaterally.
