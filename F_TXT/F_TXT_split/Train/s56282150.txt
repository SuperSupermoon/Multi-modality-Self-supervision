The heart continues to be severely enlarged. There is minimal pulmonary vascular redistribution. There is a small right effusion. There is volume loss/infiltrate in both lower lungs. Compared to the prior study the amount of vascular engorgement is slightly increased. Gas-filled distended loops of bowel are seen below the left hemidiaphragm. Some of this is probably a distended stomach and some of it is probably distended bowel due to the known sigmoid volvulus.
