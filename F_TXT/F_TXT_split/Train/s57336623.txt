AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Widespread heterogeneous pulmonary opacification has not improved appreciably since ___. The process developed progressively ___ through ___ when consolidation was global and relatively homogeneous on conventional chest radiographs, but CT scanning showed combination of alveolitis in the upper lungs and severe pneumonia in the lower. Since that time, the development of discrete lucencies in both lungs could be due either to cavitation or pulmonary interstitial emphysema due to barotrauma. There is a suggestion of a small component of pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium today along the left heart border. There is no pneumothorax. Lung volumes remain exceedingly low, but this is not a new finding. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. ET tube and right PIC line are in standard placements and an upper enteric drainage tube passes into a non-distended stomach and out of view.
