When compared to prior, there has been improved aeration particularly at the left lung base. The lungs are grossly clear with some residual retrocardiac opacity, potentially atelectasis. There is no large effusion or pulmonary edema. Chin does obscure visualization of the lung apices. Moderate cardiomegaly is again noted. No acute osseous abnormalities. Right PICC is no longer visualized.
