Previously seen right PICC is no longer visualized. Right internal jugular line is seen with tip in the right atrium and should be withdrawn approximately 3 cm to be at the cavoatrial junction. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The lungs are grossly clear. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration. Dense mitral annular calcifications are noted. Left chest wall dual-lead pacing device is again seen as well as left-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter with distal tip in the right atrium. Median sternotomy wires are again noted.
