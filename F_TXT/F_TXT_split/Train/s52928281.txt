Right-sided PICC terminates in the lower SVC. Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar contours. Slight interval improvement in markedly low lung volumes bilaterally, which may be partly positional. Stable, moderate right basilar atelectasis. Interval improvement in left basilar atelectasis may reflect deeper inspiration. Small, persistent left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. No definite evidence of pneumonia. Probable, small right pleural effusion. Increased, moderate pulmonary edema.
