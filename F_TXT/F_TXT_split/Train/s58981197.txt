In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube is been pulled back to approximately 4 cm above the carina and in good position. There is suggestion of some increasing opacification at the right base silhouetting the right heart border, worrisome for developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. There has been placement of a nasogastric tube which extends to at least the mid portion of the stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the image.
