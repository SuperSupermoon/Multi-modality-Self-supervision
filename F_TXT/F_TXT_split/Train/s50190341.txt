Low inspiratory volumes. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm, overlying the stomach. Additional tubing is seen across the upper abdomen, extending beyond the right edge of the film. A right IJ line is present, tip over proximal SVC. Additional linear density extending from the right lung apex inferiorly over the mediastinum is noted, ? epidural catheter. The previously seen right subclavian PICC line is no longer visualized. Within the limits of plain film radiography, no retained radiopacity to suggest a retained portion of the PICC line is identified. There is patchy opacity at both lung bases, likely atelectasis in light of low inspiratory volumes. In the appropriate clinical setting, the differential diagnosis could include infectious infiltrates. No pneumothorax detected. Right upper quadrant surgical clips noted.
