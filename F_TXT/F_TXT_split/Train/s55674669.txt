Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum have improved. Mild pulmonary edema has improved. Right lower opacities, a combination of effusion and atelectasis, are grossly unchanged. The amount of bilateral pleural effusions is difficult to establish, probably improved from prior study. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Surgical clips project in the upper abdomen.
