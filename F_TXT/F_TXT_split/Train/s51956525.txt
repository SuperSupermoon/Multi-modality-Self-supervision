A dialysis catheter has been removed. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. A mild interstitial abnormality is consistent with mild pulmonary edema. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Irregularity is probably unchanged along the left humeral head; this appearance could be due to degenerative change but possibly avascular necrosis. The right humeral head is unremarkable.
