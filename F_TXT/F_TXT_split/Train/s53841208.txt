Single portable AP chest radiograph was provided. Compared to the prior radiograph, there has been development of bilateral parenchymal opacities, worse on the right, with congestion of the central vasculature as well as the appearance of some Kerley B lines on the right. There is a moderate right pleural effusion and possibly small left pleural effusion. These findings suggest that the etiology is most likely asymmetric pulmonary edema, worse on the right. However, underlying infection, particularly in the right upper and lower lobe cannot be excluded.
