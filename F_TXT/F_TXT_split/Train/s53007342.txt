1. The internal jugular introducer sheath and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position. Endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. 2. Improving aeration with interval resolution of the patchy left basilar opacity consistent with resolved atelectasis. Persistent linear opacity at the right base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged given portable technique and positioning. No pneumothorax. Increasing opacity at the right apex may be related to differences in positioning given the patient's marked rotation to the right on the current examination, although an evolving air space process or upper lobe atelectasis cannot be entirely excluded. Followup imaging would be advised.
