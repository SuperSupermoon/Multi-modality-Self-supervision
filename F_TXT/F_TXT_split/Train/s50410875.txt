Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema persists, slightly improved from prior study. This extensive subcutaneous emphysema limits the evaluation of the presence of pneumothoraces. Cardiac size is top normal. Mildly widened mediastinum is stable. Moderate right effusion and small left effusion have increased with increasing adjacent opacities, right greater than left. These opacities are likely atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded. Mild pulmonary edema has improved.
