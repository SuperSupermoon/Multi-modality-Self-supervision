Compared to the prior study the right PICC has been pulled, now projects over the expected location at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac size is normal. Bibasilar opacities have markedly improved consistent with improving pleural effusion and atelectasis. Right perihilar atelectasis has also improved.
