Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The patient is intubated with the ET tube tip being approximately 5 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Heart size is most likely top normal. Right lower lobe consolidation with air bronchogram is concerning for pneumonia. In addition, there is left retrocardiac opacity with element of volume loss that might be consistent with atelectasis/pneumonia. Bilateral pleural effusion is present. No pneumothorax is seen.
