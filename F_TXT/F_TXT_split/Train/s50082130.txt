In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a pigtail catheter at the right base with removal of some of pleural fluid. No evidence of pneumothorax. Some residual opacification is consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the lower lungs. Cardiac silhouette is prominent and there is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting some underlying vascular congestion.
