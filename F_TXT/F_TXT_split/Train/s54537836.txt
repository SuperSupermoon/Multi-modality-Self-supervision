Lung volumes are low. Heart size is accentuated as a result of low lung volumes, appearing borderline enlarged. Aorta is unfolded. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present along with a small left pleural effusion. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is present. Degenerative changes are noted at the thoracolumbar junction.
