Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from earlier the same day at 5:58 p.m. Endotracheal tube is seen with tip approximately 4.2 cm from the carina. NG tube is seen with tip in the gastric body with side port in the region of the GE junction. Low lung volumes are noted. There are indistinct pulmonary vascular markings, potentially due to portable technique and supine positioning. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Atherosclerotic calcification is noted in the aorta. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
