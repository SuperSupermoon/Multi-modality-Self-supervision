Mild decrease in subcutaneous emphysema along the right lateral chest wall, right breast and right lateral neck. Again seen is a 3.5 cm rounded opacity partially projecting over the right lower hemi thorax consistent with a small hematoma likely related to chest tubes. Mild right lower lobe atelectasis is stable. Left lung is clear. No significant change in small right pneumothorax. No left pneumothorax. Trace right pleural effusion. No left pleural effusion. Heart size and mediastinal contour are otherwise unremarkable. Chain sutures are again seen within the left upper lobe and right lower lobe. A right IJ CVL tip is in the low SVC. An enteric feeding tube courses midline with tip out of field of view and side port not visualized. 2 right-sided chest tubes are in appropriate position, unchanged since prior examination. Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position at the level of thoracic inlet.
