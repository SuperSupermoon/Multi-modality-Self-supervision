1. Right internal jugular central line and left internal jugular central line unchanged in position. The tip of the left internal jugular line is near the cavoatrial junction or upper right atrium. A nasogastric tube is seen projecting with its tip over the stomach. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient rotation. Overall, the lungs appear diffusely hazy and the vasculature is less well defined, which could reflect an element of mild interstitial edema. In addition, more patchy opacities at both bases which could represent areas of aspiration, pneumonia, or atelectasis. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is somewhat diminished supine technique.
