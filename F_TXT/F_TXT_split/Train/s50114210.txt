AP chest compared to 10:20 p.m. on ___: There has been no appreciable interval change. Bilateral perihilar consolidation, more pronounced in the right lung and multinodular opacities in the right lower lung suggests that virtually all of the widespread pulmonary abnormality could be due to pneumonia. Contribution of ARDS may be quite small. There may have been mild interval improvement in a component of recoverable pulmonary edema. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. Right internal jugular line has been advanced to the upper right atrium. ET tube and nasogastric tube remain in standard placements.
