Since the prior exam, the left PICC line has been retracted, but still terminates in the SVC. The endotracheal and enteric tubes remain in appropriate position. There is no pneumothorax. The lungs are clear. The heart is normal size. There is new slight thickening of the left paratracheal stripe at the level of mild lower thoracic spine angular kyphosis where a mild T8 compression fracture was identified on recent CT scan.
