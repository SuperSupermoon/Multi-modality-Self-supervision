Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. There is right basal linear density which is most compatible with atelectasis or scarring. There is mild retrocardiac opacity which may also represent atelectasis, though the possibility of an early pneumonia is impossible to exclude. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The mid-to-upper lungs appear relatively well aerated allowing for technique.
