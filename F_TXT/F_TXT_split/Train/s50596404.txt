This exam is somewhat limited due to patient body habitus. A right IJ central line terminates in the lower SVC. A presumed pacer projects over the left heart border. Lung volumes are somewhat low, somewhat limiting evaluation. There is hilar congestion, unchanged from prior exam. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
