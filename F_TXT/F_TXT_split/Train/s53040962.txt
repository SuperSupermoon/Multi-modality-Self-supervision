In comparison with study of ___, there has been removal of all the monitoring and support devices except for the right IJ catheter. There are substantially lower lung volumes with opacification at the left base consistent with some combination of pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. No definite vascular congestion. Specifically, there is suggestion of a curvilinear line just beneath the lower margin of the second posterior rib on the left. It is unclear whether pulmonary markings extend beyond it. This could possibly represent a small pneumothorax.
