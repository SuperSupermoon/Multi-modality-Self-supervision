Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. Aorta is mildly tortuous and demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is a result of the low lung volumes. There is no overt pulmonary edema, though mild pulmonary vascular congestion may be present. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, similar compared to the prior exam. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
