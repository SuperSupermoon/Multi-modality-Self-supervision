A single portable upright view of the chest was obtained. Cardiomediastinal silhouette including moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Lungs are persistently hyperinflated, reflecting chronic small airway obstruction and/or emphysema. A streaky left basilar opacity likely represents atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
