There has been interval placement of a left-sided Port-A-Cath terminating in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. There has been interval increase in opacity projecting over the right upper hemithorax, combination of patient's known pulmonary malignancy along with pleural effusion and possible consolidation. There is blunting along the right costophrenic angle and there appears to be fluid tracking inferiorly. The right hemidiaphragm is also partially obscured. The left lung is clear.
