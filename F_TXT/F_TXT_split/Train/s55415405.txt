Portable AP upright view of the chest was provided. Since the prior exam performed earlier today, there has been development of mild pulmonary edema. The previously noted airspace opacity in the right upper lobe is stable-to-slightly-increased and there is also airspace consolidation in the left lung base. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Dual-lead pacer and left shoulder prosthesis are again noted.
