The endotracheal tube tip seats 5.5 cm above the carina. An endogastric tube tip courses inferiorly and out of field of view. An additional tubular density projects over midline and stops just before the GE junction. A right-sided PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC. A left-sided central venous catheter tip terminates at the lower SVC. The heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The lungs overall demonstrate a distorted and scarred architecture. On top of that are multifocal opacities, apparently affecting the right lung worse than the left, especially in the upper lobe. Additionally, pleural fluid is seen along the right lung apex. The left costophrenic angle has been excluded from the study.
