Previous mild interstitial edema has improved and lung volumes have increased. Moderate right and small left pleural effusion, pulmonary vascular congestion are unchanged. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly has improved. ET tube is in standard placement. Right PIC line can be traced as far as the origin of the SVC, obscured beyond that point by transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer and defibrillator leads in standard placements. Note is made of a ring calcification projecting over the cardiac apex, a chronic left ventricular aneurysm, following remote myocardial infarction.
