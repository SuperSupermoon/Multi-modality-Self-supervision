Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates moderately well expanded and clear lungs with bibasilar atelectasis. Right middle lobe opacity with preservation of the diaphragm and heart borders is most consistent with epicardial fat. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is likely accentuated due to patient positioning. Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
