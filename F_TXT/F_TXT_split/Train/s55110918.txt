AP chest compared to ___: Opacification in the right lower chest is hard to ascribe to pleural effusion alone. There may be a component of edema in the right lower lobe. Left lower lobe is substantially consolidated, usually due to atelectasis, probably postoperatively, accompanied by small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette has a normal postoperative appearance. ET tube and upper enteric drain are in standard placements. I do not see midline or pleural drains. There is no pneumothorax. Two large vascular stents are unchanged since the preoperative study in the right clavicular region.
