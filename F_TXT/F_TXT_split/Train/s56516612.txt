There is a large hiatal hernia. Its size is even increased somewhat, although this may be due to waxing and waning degree of aeration. The pulmonary vasculature appears indistinct, suggesting mild fluid overload. Streaky opacities at the medial lung bases are typical for atelectasis associated with a large hiatal hernia. It is difficult to exclude small pleural effusions, although none are explicitly demonstrated. Spinal curvature and moderate degenerative changes along the lower thoracic spine appears similar, but not completely characterized.
