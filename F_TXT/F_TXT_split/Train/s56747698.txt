No definite ET tube is identified. Tubing is folded over the upper airway. At, but could lie outside the patient or could be related to the NG tube. Clinical correlation is required. An NG tube is present -- the tip extends beneath the diaphragm loops over the expected site of the fundus. A Swan-Ganz catheter is present, tip over proximal right pulmonary artery. A left subclavian central line is present, tip not well delineated, but likely over the distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Left-sided battery device is again seen, with lead extending cephalad over left neck, beyond the edge of this film. There are low inspiratory volumes. There is dense retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is also patchy opacity at the right lung base. No gross effusion.
