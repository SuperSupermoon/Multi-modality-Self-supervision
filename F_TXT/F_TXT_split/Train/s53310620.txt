Portable semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a left IJ approach hemodialysis catheter, the tip of which projects over the right atrium. A left upper extremity PICC tip projects over the mid SVC. The tracheostomy tube is in unchanged and standard position. The lungs appear hyperinflated, though this is unchanged. Slightly increased opacities are present in the left more than right upper lobes, otherwise the lung parenchyma is unremarkable.
