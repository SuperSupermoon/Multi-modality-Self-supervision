The ET tube tip 6.1 cm above the carina. NG tube tip beneath diaphragm, overlying gastric fundus. Compared to the prior film, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is the right base opacity with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm, similar to the prior film. Possible minimal improvement in left base opacity. No gross left effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. Biapical pleural scarring is again noted.
