An AP upright chest radiograph shows new airspace consolidation in the right mid lung field, probably in the superior segment of the right lower lobe and the findings, together with the patient's clinical history, suggests pneumonia. The cardiac silhouette is large, and, even taking into account AP projection may be slightly larger than on the persists patient's previous study but central pulmonary vasculature is not congested. A small right pleural effusion may be present superimposed on known the pleural thickening and calcified plaques.
