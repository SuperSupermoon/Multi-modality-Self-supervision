1. The patient is markedly rotated on the current examination. The endotracheal tube has its tip 4.4 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. A right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position with its tip in the proximal to mid SVC. 2. There is worsening bilateral airspace process, likely pulmonary edema with increasing consolidation at the left base likely reflecting compressive atelectasis in the setting of a pleural effusion. A smaller right effusion is also likely evident. A right-sided dual-lead pacer remains in place with its leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle respectively. No pneumothorax appreciated. Heart remains enlarged.
