Bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right, which may be slightly increased since the prior study. Left base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, but underlying consolidation not excluded. Catheter is seen terminating in the right axilla; query whether a midline catheter vs a migrated PICC in inappropriate position.
