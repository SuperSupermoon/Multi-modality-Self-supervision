Single portable view of the chest is compared to prior outside reference CT scan performed earlier the same day. Left chest wall port is seen with catheter tip in the region of the mid SVC. Right-sided chest tube catheter tip at the right upper thorax. Pneumothorax is not clearly delineated on this portable exam, potentially due to projection. Surgical chain sutures project over the right upper lung. There is associated volume loss in the right hemithorax presumably from prior right upper lobectomy. The left lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unremarkable. Right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is again noted. Right lateral sixth rib fracture is again noted as on prior CT. Osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable.
