Small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Left subclavian central venous line again terminates deep in the right atrium. Right pleural effusion adjacent atelectasis is minimally improved, however this may be secondary to patient positioning. Small left pleural effusion is again seen. Heart size is unchanged and retrocardiac atelectasis is similar. Pulmonary vascular congestion is similar to yesterday's radiograph.
