Single portable upright chest radiograph was provided. The images are underpenetrated so detection of pulmonary edema is limited. Streaky opacities at the bases may represent atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged allowing for differences in technique. The bones are intact. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
