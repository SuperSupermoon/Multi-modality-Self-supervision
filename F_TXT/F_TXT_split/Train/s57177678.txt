Tip of the new endotracheal tube is at the thoracic inlet, 4.5 cm above the carina in standard placement. Borderline interstitial edema seen earlier has improved as lung volumes have increased. Consolidation developing in the right lower lobe, and worsening in the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe is probably aspiration pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed, left greater than right, but not substantial. Heart size is normal. Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax.
