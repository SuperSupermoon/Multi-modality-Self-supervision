There is improved aeration at the left lung base with persistent retrocardiac opacity, concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. Pulmonary vascular prominence with minimal interstitial haze may be secondary to mild fluid overload. No pneumothorax is detected. Heart size appears mildly enlarged, which may be exaggerated by AP technique and slightly low lung volumes. Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
