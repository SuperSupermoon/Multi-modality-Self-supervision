A PICC line terminates in the right axillary line on the right. A gastrostomy tube projects over the left upper quadrant. A tracheostomy is in place. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged including borderline cardiomegaly. There is new left basilar opacification, although fairly plate-like and streaky which may indicate atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
