As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The right internal jugular vein catheter remains in place. The right lung shows improved ventilation with, however, constant volume loss of the middle lobe. The pleural effusion on the left has minimally decreased in extent but is still overall extensive. The subsequent left areas of hypoventilation are unchanged.
