Single portable frontal image of the chest. There are low lung volumes. An area of opacity is seen at the left lung base, which could reflect atelectasis but cannot exclude aspiration or pneumonia in the right clinical context. The lungs are otherwise clear. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged but similar to prior exam. The aorta is again noted to be tortuous and dilated, unchanged from prior exam. An area of calcification is seen overlying the right neck, unchanged from prior exams.
