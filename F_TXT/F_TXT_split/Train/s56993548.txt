CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Comparison to chest x-rays from the same day at 12:59 p.m. An ET tube is present. The tip lies approximately a 3.2 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A right IJ central line is present, tip over distal SVC. There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, upper zone redistribution and interstitial edema, consistent with CHF. There is increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Minimal atelectasis at the right base. Compared with earlier the same day, CHF findings appear slightly improved and the cardiac silhouette is also probably slightly smaller. No overt effusions, but small layering effusions might not be readily apparent.
