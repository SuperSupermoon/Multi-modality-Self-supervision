As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are constant, with exception of the right internal jugular vein catheter that has been removed in the interval. Low lung volumes. Diffuse predominantly interstitial opacity suggesting multifocal pneumonia and blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, likely caused by a small pleural effusion. The old changes have overall not changed in extent and severity.
