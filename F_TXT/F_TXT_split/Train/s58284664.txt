The ET tube tip lies approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. The left subclavian PICC line tip overlies the right atrium and could be retracted by approximately 4 cm to lie in the distal SVC. An enteric type tube is present, extent beneath the diaphragm, off the film. No obvious pneumothorax is identified. Cardiac silhouette remains slightly enlarged. Again seen is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. The more patchy opacity previously seen at the left base is less apparent hand may have resolved. Patchy opacity at the right cardiophrenic region is again noted. Minimal platelike atelectasis in the right mid zone laterally. Upper zone redistribution. Slight interval improvement in degree of vascular plethora. A rounded density measuring approximately 13 mm in diameter of the was pre the same projecting over the lateral right mid zone overlies the rib cage on the current examination and therefore lies outside the long. Clips noted along the lower right neck/thoracic edema.
