As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal improvement with a reduction in extent and severity of the known right pleural effusion. However, effusions are still clearly seen on both the left and the right side. Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis persists. Mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumonia.
