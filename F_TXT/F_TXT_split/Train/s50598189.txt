In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a right chest tube. Continued very low lung volumes. Opacification persists along the right lateral chest wall, suggesting that much of this opacification represents a loculated pleural collection. Decubitus view would be necessary to determine whether there is any free pleural fluid present. Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
