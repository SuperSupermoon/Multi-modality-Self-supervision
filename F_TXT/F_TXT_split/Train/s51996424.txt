Lung volumes are slightly reduced compared to the previous exam. The heart size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures as a result of low lung volumes. Patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases. This is nonspecific, and could reflect areas of atelectasis, but aspiration or infection is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. No acute osseous abnormalities.
