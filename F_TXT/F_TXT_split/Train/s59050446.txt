Again seen are the opacities in the superolateral portions of both the right and left upper lungs, right larger than left. Differences in appearance compared to the conventional frontal view from ___ may be partially accounted for by the considerable differences in positioning. Ill definition of the right upper zone mass could also represent postprocedural change. Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear. No CHF or effusion identified.
