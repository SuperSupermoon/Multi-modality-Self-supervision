Two catheters are now seen using the left internal jugular approach, both of which have their tip in the mid superior vena cava. The patient is status post median sternotomy with valvular replacement. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There continues to be pulmonary vascular congestion in the setting of low lung volumes with no overt pulmonary edema or focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. The right hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated, but unchanged. No pleural effusions are appreciated.
