In comparison with study of ___, the left hemidiaphragmatic contour is better seen than on the previous study. There is still some residual opacification at the base that could reflect a small effusion and compressive atelectasis. Mild atelectatic changes are also seen at the right base. There is some indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, suggesting some mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Tracheostomy tube and right central catheter are essentially unchanged.
