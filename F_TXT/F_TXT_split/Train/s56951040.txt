Pulmonary edema developed yesterday in the setting of persistent left lower lobe consolidation. This may well be masking disseminated infection, particularly in the right lung. It is accompanied by increasing large left pleural effusion. Heart size is indeterminate. Tracheostomy tube is roughly midline. Right subclavian in left PIC line ends both and in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
