AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar portable chest examination obtained six hours earlier during the same day. Previously identified left-sided pigtail end drainage catheter remains in unchanged position. There remains a 2 cm wide apical pneumothorax in the left hemithorax and appears unchanged during the latest six hours examination interval. Obliteration of left-sided diaphragmatic contours post=op pleural effusion appears unchanged in magnitude. No evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. Previously identified multiple mildly dislocated rib fractures in the left hemithorax appear unchanged as can be identified on this single view examination. In comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination obtained earlier today, there may be a slight increase of the basal densities, possibly caused by pleural effusion that mostly layers in the posterior compartment of the pleural space. More precise evaluation could be accomplished by a lateral view.
