In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new. A subtle new area of opacity is developing left retrocardiac region, partially obscuring the descending thoracic aortic interface. This finding may be due to atelectasis, aspiration or an early focus of infectious pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard. No pneumothorax is detected, but lung apices are obscured due to flexed position of the patient's neck.
