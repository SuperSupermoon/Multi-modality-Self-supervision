Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. Following insertion of a nasogastric drainage tube which ends above the usual location of the left hemidiaphragm, the severe distention of the aerated viscus projecting over the left lower chest has improved. I cannot tell whether this is a herniated viscus above the diaphragm or one below an elevated left hemidiaphragm. Lungs are grossly clear. Small right pleural effusion is stable. Heart size normal. No pneumothorax.
