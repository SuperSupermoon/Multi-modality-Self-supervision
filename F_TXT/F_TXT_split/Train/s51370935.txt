As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in diameter of the cardiac silhouette, an increase in diameter of the mediastinum and lower lung volumes. Areas of atelectasis at both lung bases are of unchanged extent, but mild fluid overload might now be additionally present. No evidence of pneumothorax.
