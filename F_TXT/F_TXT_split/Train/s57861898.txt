A portable AP upright chest radiograph shows bilateral pulmonary pigtail catheters, with that on the right now directed inferiorly beyond its entrance into the thoracic cage compared to study from earlier today where it was directed superiorly. There appears to be improvement in aeration of the right base and decreased fluid. Left pigtail catheter is in relatively unchanged position. There remains some consolidation obscuring the left medial hemidiaphragm and lower thoracic aorta. Left-sided pacing device with three intact leads is noted.
