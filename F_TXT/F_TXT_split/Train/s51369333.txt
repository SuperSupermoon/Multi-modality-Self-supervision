AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The ET tube tip is approximately 4.3 cm above the carina and slightly impinging the right wall of the trachea and should be repositioned. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right subclavian line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. Minimal bibasilar opacities most likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pulmonary edema is seen.
