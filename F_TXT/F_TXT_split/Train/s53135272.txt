As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimally increasing atelectasis at the right lung bases. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus could reflect the presence of a small pleural effusion. Otherwise, there is no relevant change. The cardiac silhouette continues to be enlarged, with enlargement of the left atrium and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No evidence of pneumonia, areas of atelectasis persist.
