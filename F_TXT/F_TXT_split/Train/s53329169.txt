AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. The NG tube passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. The right central venous line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. The left chest tube has been removed. There is no interval development of pneumothorax. Widespread parenchymal consolidations on the other hand, left more than right, appear to be minimally progressed since the prior study, particularly in the right lung base. No interval increase in pleural effusion is demonstrated. Left rib fractures are re-demonstrated with associated subcutaneous air collection, not substantially changed since prior examination.
