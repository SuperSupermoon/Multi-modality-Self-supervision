As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. Atelectatic changes are seen at both the left and the right lung bases. The patient is rotated to the left, which causes an increase in radiodensity at the level of the left costophrenic sinus. Although a left aspiration pneumonia cannot be excluded, the change is more likely reflect atelectasis combines to a small pleural effusion.
