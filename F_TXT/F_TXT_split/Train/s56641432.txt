AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging: Right hemithorax is entirely opacified and mediastinum is leftward shifted, suggesting a very large, and probably not chronic right pleural effusion. Left lung is essentially clear. Findings were discussed by telephone with the house officer caring for this patient at 10:45 a.m.
