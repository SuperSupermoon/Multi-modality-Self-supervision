There is a persistent left pleural effusion with associated volume loss, not significantly changed from the prior exam. A small right linear consolidation is likely atelectasis in the setting of lower lung volumes. Again, diffuse interstitial abnormalities are present. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The size of the heart is somewhat difficult to evaluate given the volume loss and adjacent effusion.
