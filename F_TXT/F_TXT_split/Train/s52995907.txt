The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Heart size remains mildly enlarged, unchanged. Moderate size hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated. Aortic knob calcifications are present. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Linear opacities in both lung bases likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus suggests a trace left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified.
