AP chest compared to ___: Severe confluent pulmonary consolidation which has progressed over the past three days, is more severe today than it was on ___. Since lung volumes are lower, this could be due to less effective or decreased positive pressure ventilation. Tip of the endotracheal tube above the upper margin of the clavicles with the chin down, is 1-2 cm above optimal placement, even though the tip measures 3 cm from the carina electronically. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the distal portion of a distended stomach. Right jugular line ends at or just below the superior cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are small if any, but mild cardiomegaly has been present throughout, and therefore the contribution of hydrostatic edema to likely diffuse alveolar damage and widespread pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate. No pneumothorax.
