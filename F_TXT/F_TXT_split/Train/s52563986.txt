As compared to the previous radiograph, the large RO mediastinal and hilar masses have overall substantially decreased in size. The lung volumes, however, have also decreased, causing crowding of the vascular and bronchial structures, notably at the lung bases. In addition, there is a new retrocardiac atelectasis as well as an overall increase in vascular diameters, likely reflecting mild pulmonary edema.
