Frontal portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates the endotracheal tube tip approximately 8.5 cm from the carina. This should be advanced by roughly ___ to 20 mm for more appropriate positioning. The right internal jugular central venous line tip is at the mid portion of the SVC. The enteric tube tip is past the diaphragm and out of the field of view. As compared to the prior study, there is improvement in the pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion. Concurrent pneumonia is a possibility. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.
