Left PICC projects over the left subclavian vein, just beyond the axillary vein junction. Although positioning limits comparison, it appears slightly more lateral than on previous examination. No pneumothorax. Slight interval worsening of right upper lobe post obstructive consolidation with bowing of the fissure. Heterogeneous consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes are also more prominent than on prior examination. Right mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy have been more fully evaluated on recent chest CT. A moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. The left lung is clear except for minimal linear left basilar atelectasis.
