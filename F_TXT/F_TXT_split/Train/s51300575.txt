Patient is rotated somewhat to the right. There are relatively low lung volumes. Left hilar prominence may be due to vascular congestion although underlying lymphadenopathy, pulmonary consolidation, or other pulmonary lesion is not excluded. Reticular nodular opacities at the lung bases are nonspecific but could be due to small airways disease. There is also additional more focal left base retrocardiac opacity ; differential diagnosis includes pneumonia although underlying pulmonary mass is not excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable. Chronic deformity at the partially imaged right glenohumeral joint.
