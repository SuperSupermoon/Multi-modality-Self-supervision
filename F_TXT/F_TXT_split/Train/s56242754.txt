Single portable supine frontal view of the chest. The patient is very rotated. The lung bases are almost uninterpretable given the low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. Supine positioning is contributing to pulmonary vascular engorgement. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged.
