Support and monitoring devices are similar in position to the prior study, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Right lower lobe consolidation has slightly improved, but left lower lobe consolidation has worsened. Multifocal pulmonary nodules, some with cavitation are again demonstrated consistent with history of septic emboli. Small-to-moderate right and small left pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
