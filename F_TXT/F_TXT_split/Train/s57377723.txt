AP radiograph was reviewed in comparison with one day prior. The right internal jugular line terminates in the right atrium. The pigtail catheter is projecting over the right hemithorax. There is interval increase in right pleural effusion, still small. No pneumothorax is seen. Left retrocardiac consolidation appears to be also slightly progressed that might be due to interval increase in pleural effusion. The upper lungs are essentially clear. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.
