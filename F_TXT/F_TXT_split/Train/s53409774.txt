The right internal jugular venous catheter has now been removed. Hazy opacity in the left lower lung with slight blurring of the left hemidiaphragm suggests moderate left dependent pleural effusion, and is slightly increased from the prior exam. Mild pulmonary edema is probably overall unchanged when accounting for redistribution. Lung volumes are low, unchanged. Focal region of opacity in the right lower lung is more conspicuous on today's exam and concerning for pneumonia in the setting of leukocytosis. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly persists and is probably overall unchanged. The replaced aortic valve and median sternotomy wires appear intact and unchanged. No pneumothorax.
