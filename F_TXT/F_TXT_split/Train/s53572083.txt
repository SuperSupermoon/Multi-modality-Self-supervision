In comparison with the study of ___, the monitor and support devices remain in place. There has been a decrease in the degree of right pneumothorax with substantial re-expansion of the right lung. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. Postoperative changes on the left are similar to the previous study. Basilar opacification at the right base has increased, consistent with layering effusion and volume loss in the lower lung. Again, it would be difficult to radiographically exclude developing pneumonia on either side.
