AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. During the interval, the right-sided chest tube advanced from anterior below has been removed. The left-sided chest tube remains in place. Lungs remain aerated as before, and the small loculated pneumothorax on the right base persists but has not increased. Presently, there is no pericardial drainage tube detected. Previously described PICC line remains unchanged. The right-sided apical area shows a less than 1 cm wide separation of the right-sided pleura which is unchanged in comparison with the previous study. It is also noted that the patient has been extubated since the prior study one day earlier.
