The lung volumes are lower in comparison to the prior study. There is some opacification of the left base which may represent atelectasis and less likely pneumonia, that could be better evaluated with PA and lateral radiographs. Again seen are multiple calcified pleural and diaphragmatic plaques consistent with prior asbestos exposure. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged. The pleural surfaces are normal without effusion or pneumothorax.
