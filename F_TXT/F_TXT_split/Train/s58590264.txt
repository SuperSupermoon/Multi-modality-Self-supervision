The patient is status post left chest tube removal, with an apparent persistent very small lateral pneumothorax at the left apex. There are also several rounded lucencies at the left base which may represent small loculated hydropneumothoraces. With the exception of chest tube removal, there has not been a substantial change in the appearance of the chest since the previous study performed earlier today.
