In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the mid to lower portion of the stomach with the side port at about the level of the esophagogastric junction. The tube should be pushed forward several cm to be in better position. There are lower lung volumes that mildly accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Some tortuosity of the descending aorta is seen. Increased opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectasis and probable small effusion. Minimal atelectatic changes are seen on the right.
