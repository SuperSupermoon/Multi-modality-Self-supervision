Comparison is made to the prior study from ___. There are diffuse parenchymal opacities within the right mid and lower lung fields as well as the left base. The area of consolidation in the right mid lung has increased and this can be consistent with worsening pneumonia. There are no pneumothoraces or signs for overt pulmonary edema. The heart size is within normal limits and stable. There is a pigtail catheter projecting over the left upper abdomen.
