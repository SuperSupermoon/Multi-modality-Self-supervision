Right IJ central line tip near cavoatrial junction, stable. No pneumothorax. Worsened bibasilar opacities, particularly on the right, may represent worsening edema, consider pneumonitis. Stable left perihilar interstitial peribronchial thickening. Increased interstitial prominence in the lower lungs, consistent with edema. Stable heart size, pulmonary vascularity. Small left pleural effusion is more apparent.
