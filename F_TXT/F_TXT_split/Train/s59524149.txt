Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. Lung volumes are low. Clips are noted in the right upper quadrant. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis likely accounts for low lung volumes. No effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size cannot be assessed. Mediastinal contour appears prominent, though this can be due to supine portable technique. Bony structures are intact.
