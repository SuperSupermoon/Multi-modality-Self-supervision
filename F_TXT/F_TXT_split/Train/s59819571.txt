AP chest compared to ___, read in conjunction with torso CT on ___: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, seen on the ___ torso CT are presumably still present. Greater opacification on the left suggests worsening left lower lobe atelectasis. I cannot exclude pneumonia, but there is no reason to invoke that diagnosis to explain what I see. The upper lobes are clear. Moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding. Atrioventricular pacer defibrillator system is unchanged in standard position, aside from the location of the proximal electrode spanning the SVC and the upper right atrium.
