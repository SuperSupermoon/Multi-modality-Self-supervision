Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.9 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube courses below the level the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image, but side port likely at the level of the proximal stomach. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The aorta is unfolded. Streaky left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis but consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen. No evidence of pneumothorax.
