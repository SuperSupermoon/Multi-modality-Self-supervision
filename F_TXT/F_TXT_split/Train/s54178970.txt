As compared to ___ radiograph, endotracheal tube is been advanced slightly, now terminating 3.2 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are lower, resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures. A subtle patchy opacity at the left lung base could reflect patchy atelectasis, aspiration, or an early focus of pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard. Note is also made of gastric distension in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen.
