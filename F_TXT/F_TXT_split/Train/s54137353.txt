Comparison is made to the previous study from ___. There are diffuse airspace opacities throughout both lung fields, more confluent in the lung bases since the previous study. Findings are worrisome for developing pneumonia. There is also poor visualization of the hemidiaphragms suggestive of underlying pleural effusions bilaterally. The heart size is enlarged, but stable. There are no pneumothoraces.
