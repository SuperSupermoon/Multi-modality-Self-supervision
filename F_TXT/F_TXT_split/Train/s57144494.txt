Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by improving asymmetrical air space disease, which remains more severe on the right than the left. Bilateral poorly defined pulmonary nodules are present, some of which demonstrate cavitation, highly concerning for septic emboli. Nodules were also visible on Chest CTA ___, but cavitation within nodules is apparently new since that time. Moderate to large right and small to moderate left pleural effusions are again demonstrated with adjacent lower lobe atelectasis and or consolidation.
