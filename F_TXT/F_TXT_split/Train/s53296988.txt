The patient's mandible obscures the apex and upper trachea limiting evaluation of this area. An aortic stent graft remains in place. No tracheostomy tube can be visualized. Lung volumes are low with patchy streaky opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema, although there is crowding of the vasculature likely related to low volumes. There is likely a small left effusion. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
