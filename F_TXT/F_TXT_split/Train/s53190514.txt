Moderate-sized layering pleural effusions are similar to the prior study allowing for differences in positioning, with the left remaining larger than the right. Cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta are unchanged. Bibasilar areas of atelectasis are again demonstrated adjacent to the pleural effusions. No new or worsening lung opacities are detected.
