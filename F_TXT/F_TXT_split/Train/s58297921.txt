In the interval since the prior study, there has been a placement of new tracheostomy tube in appropriate position. A right-sided internal jugular line terminates in the low SVC. There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. There is also now new intraperitoneal free air status post PEG tube placement.
