Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable compared to the prior radiograph. Left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place in the left hemithorax with a persistent moderate-size partially-loculated left pleural effusion. Right-sided pigtail pleural catheter also remains in place, with a tiny right apical pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by interstitial edema. Additional multifocal patchy opacities in the lingula and both lung bases may reflect patchy atelectasis or developing infection.
