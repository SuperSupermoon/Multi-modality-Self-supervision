As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The parenchymal opacities that pre-existed have slightly increased on the right. Blunting of the right costophrenic sinus could suggest the presence of a small right pleural effusion. On the left, there also is a small effusion and retrocardiac atelectasis. The diffuse decrease in radiolucency of the left lung persists. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
