Diffuse parenchymal opacities have improved slightly consistent with pulmonary edema. With the underlying diffuse opacities, definitive consolidation is difficult to exclude especially without the lateral view. A small left calcified granuloma is unchanged. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis is stable. Small bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. The mediastinum is unremarkable.
