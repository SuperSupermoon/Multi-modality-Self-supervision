Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There is patchy left base opacity which could relate to atelectasis, although underlying infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
