Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate interval redevelopment of a right-sided pleural effusion. The effusion forms an air-fluid level, suggesting persistent pneumothorax, even though pneumothroax was less conspicuous on previous exam than on the post-procedure exam. There is interval worsening of the right lung base opacity, consistent with the reaccumulating right pleural effusion. The large left pleural effusion remains unchanged from prior imaging. The right-sided PICC line and pacer wires are again noted in the expected course, unchanged from previous imaging. Cardiomediastinal silhouette can again not be characterized given obscuration by bilateral pleural effusions.
