AP chest compared to ___: There has been no interval change at least to prior chest radiographs, which are similar in appearance to chest radiographs since at least ___. Specifically, left lung base is elevated by chronic moderate left pleural effusion responsible for substantial left lower lobe atelectasis. Less severe atelectasis at the right lung base recurs intermittently. The heart is moderately enlarged. Upper lungs are grossly clear. Tracheostomy tube in standard position. Trachea looks generally narrowed, which could be a function of bronchomalacia, a chronic finding in this patient.
