A right-sided chest tube is seen entering the inferior lateral aspect of the chest wall and terminating in the right upper lung, unchanged in position. As compared to prior chest examination, there is a new right basal opacity which is concerning for an infectious process. There is also a component of pleural effusion which appears increased in size since prior examination. The left lung is essentially clear. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
