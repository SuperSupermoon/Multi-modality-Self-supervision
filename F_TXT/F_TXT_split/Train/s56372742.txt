An ET tube is present. The tip lies at the level of mid clavicular heads are of the carina. An NG tube is present. The tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film. An apparent intra-aortic balloon pump is present. The radiopaque tip overlies the upper edge of the aortic arch -- clinical correlation regarding retraction by approximately 3 cm to lie in the proximal descending aorta is requested. Faint cylindrical density overlying the thoracic spine at the level of the aortic arch likely represents material outside the patient. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or minimally enlarged. Vascular plethora and diffusely increased interstitial markings is present. This could represent CHF with interstitial edema, though a diffuse interstitial process could have a similar appearance. There is subsegmental atelectasis at both lung bases. No gross effusion.
