Two chest tubes remain in place in the left hemithorax, with a small left pneumothorax with both apical and basilar components. This is probably similar to the prior radiograph ___ ___ at 5:06 a.m., allowing for positional differences of the patient. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Patchy and linear areas of atelectasis are present in the left lower lobe, and there is also a probable small left pleural effusion. Right lung is remarkable only for minimal linear basilar atelectasis.
