Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and accompanied by upper zone vascular redistribution and minimal interstitial edema. No confluent areas of consolidation are identified in either lung. Prominence of superior mediastinum is noted as well as slightly asymmetrical biapical thickening, left greater than right. This is difficult to assess due to apicolordotic projection and slight rightward patient rotation. When the patient's condition permits, standard PA and lateral chest radiographs are suggested for better evaluation of the upper mediastinum and lung apices.
