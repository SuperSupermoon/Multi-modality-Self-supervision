The lungs are well expanded, and clear with the exception of chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and new right lower lobe atelectasis. The pulmonary vasculature appears normal without evidence of edema. The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged, status post mitral valvuloplasty and CABG. Median sternotomy wires remain intact. An NG tube remains in place with its tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach. There is no pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
