AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are lower, and there is considerably more pulmonary opacification. Since the distribution is relatively peripheral, in the right lung, I suspect this is more likely pneumonia than pulmonary edema alone, but there is persistent pulmonary edema seen in the left lung accompanied by a moderate left pleural effusion. Septic embolus is an alternative diagnosis for the peripheral lesions on the right. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable, as is severely dilated thoracic aorta. A right internal jugular line ends close to the level of the superior cavoatrial junction. Findings were discussed over the telephone with the house officer caring for this patient at the time of dictation.
