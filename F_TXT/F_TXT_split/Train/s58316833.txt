There is no radiographic evidence of pneumothorax following a recent procedure. Large cavitary right upper lobe mass is again visualized, with apparent slight increase in opacity adjacent to the mass, potentially representing post-procedural hemorrhage. Linear atelectasis has developed at the left lung base. Otherwise, no relevant short interval changes.
