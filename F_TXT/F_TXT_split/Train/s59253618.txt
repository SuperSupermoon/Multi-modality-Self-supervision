1. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm and the tip is not fully identified. A left-sided pacer, endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged. There are small layering effusions with improving overall appearance to the lungs, suggesting resolving mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. However, there is a persistent more focal airspace consolidation in the right and mid lower lungs which although this could represent asymmetric clearing of edema raises concern for aspiration and pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. Followup imaging may be helpful. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
