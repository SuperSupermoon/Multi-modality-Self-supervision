There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm as on prior. Right upper lobe opacity is compatible with atelectasis with underlying mass, better characterized by prior cross-sectional imaging. Spiculated left upper lobe nodules also partially visualized as well as adjacent linear opacities. There is no new confluent consolidation or effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No acute osseous abnormalities.
