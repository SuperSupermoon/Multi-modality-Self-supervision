There is been near complete resolution of the previously noted large right pleural effusion status post thoracentesis. The left moderate pleural effusion is likely unchanged accounting for differences in lung volumes, with improved aeration now demonstrated. Patchy bibasilar compressive atelectasis persists. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are similar. No pneumothorax is detected. Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC. A biliary catheter is again noted within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Breast implants are re- demonstrated. Known diffuse osseous metastatic disease is better assessed on the previous CT.
