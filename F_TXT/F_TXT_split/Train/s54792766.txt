1. The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and left internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. There is interval worsening bilateral layering pleural effusions with increasing airspace consolidation particularly at the left base which likely reflects lower lobe atelectasis. Clinical correlation is advised. In addition, the pulmonary vasculature is more ill-defined suggesting a component of superimposed mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Despite marked patient rotation to the left, the heart remains stably enlarged with a left ventricular prominence which likely reflects cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded. No large pneumothorax is seen, although sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is somewhat diminished given the semi-supine technique.
