Status post median sternotomy for CABG with overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours given differences in patient positioning. Persistent low lung volumes with scattered patchy opacities within both lungs but predominantly the bases most likely reflecting patchy atelectasis. Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no overt pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
