Endotracheal tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina, orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach and is appropriately positioned. Bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities are persisting. Left hemithorax is less opaque than it was yesterday, but whether this is due to differences from layering of left pleural effusion and position or true decrease in the lung opacities is difficult to differentiate. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
