Opacification in the right hilar region and right upper lobe corresponds to known of malignancy, better assessed on the previous PET-CT with associated postobstructive changes. In the interval, there is new development of a moderate right pleural effusion. Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of the right-sided pleural effusion. Abnormal widened mediastinal contour is unchanged and compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy. Left lung is clear without pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.
