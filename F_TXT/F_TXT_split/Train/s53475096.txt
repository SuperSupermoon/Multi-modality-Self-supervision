Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Right paratracheal ovoid calcifications may represent calcified lymph nodes and may be a sequela of prior granulomatous disease. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The mediastinum and hilar contours are unremarkable. Diffuse osteopenia noted.
