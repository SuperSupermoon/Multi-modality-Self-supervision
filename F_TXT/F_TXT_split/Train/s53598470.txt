There is a moderate-sized left apical pneumothorax. The right lung remains hyperinflated, consistent with patient's known diagnosis of COPD. There are no focal areas of consolidation. The heart size is normal. The aorta remains tortuous. Left-sided rib deformities are noted but similar in appearance to the prior studies and likely reflect old rib fractures. No acute displaced rib fractures are noted. Surgical clips overlie the right lower lung.
