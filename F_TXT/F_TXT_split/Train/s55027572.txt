Left subclavian central line and mild cardiomegaly are unchanged. There continues to be a small right effusion. There is a 2.7 cm x 1.4 oblong hazy opacity in the right upper lung laterally. It is unclear if this is a focal area of atelectasis, an early infiltrate, or mass. Attention should be paid to this area on follow-up.
