Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. Heterogeneous opacification of the lungs is consistent with edema without pulmonary vascular engorgement, and multifocal pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends in the mid SVC. The left-sided internal jugular central venous line ends in the distal SVC. The endotracheal tube ends 4.7 cm from thecarina. The nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view.
