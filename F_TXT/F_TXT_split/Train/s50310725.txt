The patient is rotated, slightly limiting the evaluation. Multiple sternal wires and a cardiac valve are present. There is no large consolidation and no pneumothorax. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which could be due to a small left pleural effusion. The heart size is within normal limits. Moderate degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
