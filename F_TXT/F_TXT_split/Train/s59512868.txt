The tip of the Dobbhoff tube projects over the left upper quadrant likely within the gastric body. A left upper extremity PICC terminates in the superior cavoatrial junction. Hazy opacity at the left lung base reflects a moderate layering pleural effusion as seen on CT chest from one day prior with associated near complete collapse of the left lower lobe. There is also a small right subpulmonic pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. There is no pneumothorax. Pigtail catheter and vascular coils projects over the right upper quadrant.
