Lungs are probably hyperinflated. A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle. The tip of the RV lead extends very minimally beyond the edge of the film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Prominence of the pulmonary arteries with a tapered appearance is suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. Compared to 1 day earlier, upper zone redistribution appears improved. No CHF. Equivocal minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle and bibasilar atelectasis. No focal infiltrate identified to confirm pneumonia. Probable degenerative changes in both glenohumeral joints, not fully evaluated on this examination.
