No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged in this patient with intact midline wires following CABG procedure. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen, especially on the left. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could possibly represent a developing consolidation.
