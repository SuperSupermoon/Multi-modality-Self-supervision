1. Endotracheal tube has its tip 3.5 cm above the carina. There is a nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There are patchy opacities in both upper lobes, left greater than right as well as in the right mid medial lung and at both lung bases. These findings could represent aspiration or pneumonia, less likely pulmonary edema given the unusual distribution of the findings. Clinical correlation is advised. The heart is normal in size. There is some fullness to the right paratracheal soft tissues and hilar soft tissues which could be related to vascular congestion and the more consolidative process within the lungs. These can be better assessed on followup imaging or by comparison to remote studies. No large effusions. No pneumothorax.
