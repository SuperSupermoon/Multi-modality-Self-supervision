CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Slight underpenetration and low inspiratory volumes. Allowing for this, an ET tube is present, tip 2.3 cm above the carina. A left-sided pacemaker-type device is present. The lead tip is poorly visualized but likely over the right ventricle. An NG tube is present, again, poorly visualized beyond the level of the distal esophagus, due to underpenetration -- it may continue further, but this is difficult to confirm on this view. A right subclavian central line is present, tip over distal SVC/RA junction. A right IJ line is present, poorly traced due to underpenetration. There is prominence of cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There are dense right greater than left opacities consistent with bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation likely with small effusions. Compared with ___ at 21:59 p.m., the pulmonary findings are grossly unchanged.
