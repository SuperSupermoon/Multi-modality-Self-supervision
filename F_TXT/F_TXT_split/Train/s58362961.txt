AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained six and a half hours earlier during the same day. Status post sternotomy and cardiac enlargement with typical annuloplasty of mitral valve prosthesis as before. Patient is now extubated. Previously described right internal jugular central venous line remains in unchanged position and terminates in lower SVC. There remains a small approximately 1 cm wide pneumothorax in the right apical area. On the next preceding examination, the pneumothorax is difficult to identify. Thus,the question if pneumothorax has increased in size cannot be assessed. There is no evidence of new pulmonary abnormalities. On the preceding chest examination, the patient was still intubated. The pulmonary vasculature was more prominent, but this may be related to technical image factors.
