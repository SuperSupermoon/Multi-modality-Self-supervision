AP view of the chest provided. Left-sided chest tube has been removed. There is interval resolution of apical pneumothoraces. There are bilateral linear opacities at the prior chest tube sites, likely atelectatic changes or very subtle bleeding along tube tract. Lung volumes are low, which may contribute to the apparent increase in cardiac size.
