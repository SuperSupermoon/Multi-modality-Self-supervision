The ET tube is in stable position, terminating 6 cm above the carina. There is stable position of right chest pacer device with associated dual leads projecting in unchanged position approximately over the right atrium and right ventricle. Multiple median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are again seen. Left chest tube is in stable position. Enteric tube again seen in stable position with tip projecting of left hemidiaphragm, consistent with known large hiatal hernia. There is a PA catheter are in stable position. There is leftward rotation on the current radiograph. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. In comparison to prior radiograph, there is increased opacification at the right lung base and indistinctness of the right lateral CP angle, consistent with new small right layering pleural effusion. There is no left effusion. There is continued retrocardiac opacification obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with ongoing left lower lobe volume loss, possibly atelectasis. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax.
