An enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip and side port out of view on this image. An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating just above the thoracic inlet, approximately 8 cm above the carina. There is increased dense consolidation at the right middle lobe with air bronchograms from the most recent prior study. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged, with patchy opacities at the left lung base, representing asymmetric dependent pulmonary edema or infection/aspiration. The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.
