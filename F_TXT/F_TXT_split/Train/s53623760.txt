In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, there has been little change in the appearance of the chest except for new hazy increased opacity in the right lower hemi thorax, probably representing a partially layering pleural effusion on this apparently semi upright radiograph. Moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent retrocardiac opacity are not appreciably changed allowing for positional differences.
