Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Lines and tubes are in standard position. Bibasilar and left perihilar opacities, larger on the left side, have improved consistent with improving atelectasis, though superimposed infection still can be present. Collapse of the left lower lobe is persistent. If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
