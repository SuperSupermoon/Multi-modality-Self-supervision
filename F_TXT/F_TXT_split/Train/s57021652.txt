1. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 2.5 to 3 cm above the carina, unchanged. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. A right basilar pigtail catheter and a smaller left basilar catheter remain in place. There is improving aeration at both lung bases although likely a persistent layering left effusion. Superior vena caval stent remains in place and there is a stable right mediastinal mass. There is likely persistent partial left lower lobe atelectasis and resolving patchy atelectasis at the right base. There is prominence of the pulmonary vascularity and interstitium which could be related to lower lung volumes, although a component of a mild interstitial edema cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Cardiac size is difficult to assess given the overlying airspace disease.
