Assessment is limited due to patient rotation and low lung volumes. An enteric tube tip appears to be within the stomach, though side port appears to be just superior to the gastroesophageal junction and would recommend advancement by approximately 5 cm for optimal positioning. Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the upper SVC. Lung volumes are low. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta noted. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy atelectasis is noted in the right lung base. Centrilobular nodular opacities in the right upper lobe seen on previous chest CT are not well assessed on the current radiograph. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Multiple clips are noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Inferior vena cava filter is partly imaged in upper abdomen, just to the right of midline.
