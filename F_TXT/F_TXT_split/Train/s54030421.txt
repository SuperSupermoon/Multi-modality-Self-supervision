The current study demonstrates the Swan-Ganz catheter tip in the right interlobar pulmonary artery or right lower lobe pulmonary artery. The intra-aortic balloon pump has been discontinued as mentioned. The ET tube tip and the left internal jugular line are in unchanged position. There is no change in the left lower lobe opacity, most likely reflecting atelectasis in conjunction with pleural effusion. No definitive pneumothorax is seen.
