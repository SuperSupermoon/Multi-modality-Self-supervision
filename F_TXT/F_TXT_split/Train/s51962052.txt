The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Streaky right basilar opacification with volume loss suggests chronic atelectasis or scarring, also unchanged. There is potentially a small pleural effusion on the right, but no evidence for one on the left. There is no pneumothorax. As previously noted, the available AP view of the left shoulder suggests dislocation with possible healed or healing fractures suggested by irregular sclerosis along the margin of the glenoid.
