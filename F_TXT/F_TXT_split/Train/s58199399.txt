Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position. Lung volumes remain low. There are increasing patchy opacities scattered throughout both mid and lower lungs but slightly more confluent at the right base, which although these could reflect areas of patchy atelectasis, aspiration and/or pneumonia should also be considered. There is crowding of the vasculature but no pulmonary edema is evident. There is a layering right effusion. No large pneumothorax is seen. The heart remains mildly enlarged which may reflect pericardial effusion or cardiomegaly. Clinical correlation is advised. Mediastinal contours are stable.
