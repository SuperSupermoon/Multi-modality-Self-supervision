The tracheostomy tube is again visualized. NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach. There is a moderate left-sided pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Air bronchograms are visualized and it is likely that an infiltrate is also present in this region. There is pulmonary vascular re-distribution and patchy areas of alveolar infiltrate elsewhere in the lungs. The overall impression is that of CHF. Focal infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded, particularly on the left.
