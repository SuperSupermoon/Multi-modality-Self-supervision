A mediastinal drain is noted. Assessment of the cardiac silhouette size cannot be performed given extensive opacification of the left lung base due to a loculated pleural effusion and peribronchial consolidation, which appears worsened compared to prior. Opacity at the left apex is accounted for by loculated pleural effusion and known mass. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The right lung is well aerated with increased interstitial markings, and small nodules better seen on CT. The upper abdomen is unremarkable.
