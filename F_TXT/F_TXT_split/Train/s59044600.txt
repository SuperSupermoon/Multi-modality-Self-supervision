Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right-sided central venous catheter that terminates in the mid SVC. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and is likely exaggerated due to supine technique. There is bibasilar atelectasis. No definite, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There is no definite focal consolidation.
