Endotracheal tube tip lies 4.8 cm above the carina, left subclavian line tip is at mid SVC, and nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach and are all appropriately positioned. Consolidation in the right lung base has improved. Increased retrocardiac density likely due to a combination of atelectasis and/or consolidation is unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema of similar severity persists.
