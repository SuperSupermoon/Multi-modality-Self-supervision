Left-sighted PIC line terminates in the mid SVC. There is an NG tube which extends below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film. Mild bibasilar atelectasis has increased compared to the prior exam. There is bilateral perihilar vascular congestion with overall increase in mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Increased opacity at the right lung base is also concerning for possible aspiration/pneumonia. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
