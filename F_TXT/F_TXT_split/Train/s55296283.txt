Lung volumes have not changed appreciably, but generalized pulmonary opacification has worsened. Given the rapidity, if positive pressure ventilation was not altered, the change is due to volume dependent or cardiac related pulmonary edema. However since heart size and mediastinal venous caliber are normal, the change could be due entirely to a decrease in positive pressure ventilator support. Lines and tubes in standard placements. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large, and there is no pneumothorax.
