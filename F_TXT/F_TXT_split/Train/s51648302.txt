AP portable upright view of the chest. Pacemaker and midline sternotomy wires again noted without change in position. There is calcification overlying the left heart likely mitral annular. Cardiomegaly is again noted. Hila are congested and there is mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Right basal opacity is again noted most compatible with atelectasis, difficult to exclude an early pneumonia. There is increased retrocardiac opacity which could represent development of pleural effusion with probable atelectasis, also difficult to exclude pneumonia. No large pneumothorax. Bony structures appear intact.
