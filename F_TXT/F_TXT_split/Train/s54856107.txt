Heart is upper limits of normal in size and the aorta is mildly tortuous. Lungs are well-expanded and clear except for a nonspecific patchy opacity at the right lung base, which may be due to focal atelectasis, aspiration, and less likely an early focus of infectious pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
