Since the recent study, a nasogastric tube has been advanced, terminating below the diaphragm. Endotracheal tube is in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. New patchy ill-defined opacities have developed in the left upper lobe and in the inferior aspect of the lingula, most likely due to focal atelectasis or aspiration given rapid development. A poorly defined subcentimeter nodule is also noted at the level of the right third anterior rib and should be followed up by a standard PA and lateral chest x-ray prior to discharge to help determine whether this is a true pulmonary abnormality or a structure related to the rib or overlying external devices.
