Since the prior examination, there has been an increase in interstitial markings and fullness of the pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature consistent with mild pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is identified. The heart is mildly enlarged though this could be due to AP positioning. No focal consolidation is seen with normal mediastinal and hilar contours.
