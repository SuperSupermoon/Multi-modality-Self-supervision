In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again is severe COPD with bullous disease with scarring and distortion of the pulmonary architecture. The probably little change in the opacification at the right base. However, there is some increasing opacification at the left base that could represent superimposed new consolidation. No definite evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
