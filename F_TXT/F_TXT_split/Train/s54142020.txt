Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval decrease in size of the small left pleural effusion. There is no right-sided pleural effusion. Aside from persistent bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, the lungs are clear. There is stable widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, consistent with central vascular engorgement. There is no pneumothorax. The right and left internal jugular central venous catheters are unchanged in position, terminating in the mid SVC. The tracheostomy tube terminates in the mid trachea. A feeding and suction tube both course into the stomach and inferiorly out of field of view.
