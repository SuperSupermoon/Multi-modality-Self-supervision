Study is moderately limited by significant patient rotation. Increased airspace opacity over the right upper lung may be related to superimposition of structures related to rotation or early consolidation. Opacity of the left lung base may represent a small effusion with associated atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Thoracic compression fractures are incompletely assess, likely similar to prior studies. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is distorted due to patient rotation but likely unchanged.
