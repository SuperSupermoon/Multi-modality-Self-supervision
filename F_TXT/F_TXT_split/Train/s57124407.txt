Again appreciated are prominent bilateral hilar masses, right greater than left with slight progression in size of the left hilar mass compatible with patient's known mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy seen on prior CT examination. The left main bronchial stent remains in expected position and appears patent. There is re-demonstration of mild bibasilar volume loss; however, there is increased subtle opacity of the left upper lung suggestive of a component of atelectasis and collapse. There is slight global increase in interstitial opacities suggestive of a component of edema. There is no clear pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
