Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with a small to moderate right apical pneumothorax which has minimally increased in size since the previous study. Dense airspace consolidation within the right mid and lower lung has progressed and is accompanied by a pleural effusion which is difficult to quantify in the setting of extensive lung consolidation. Left retrocardiac opacity and moderate left pleural effusion are not appreciably changed.
