Portable semi upright chest radiograph was obtained. Left jugular central venous catheter terminates in the distal SVC as before. Increased prominence of bronchovascular structures is likely related to decreased lung volumes. Persistent elevation of right hemidiaphragm is noted. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The heart is mildly and stably enlarged.
