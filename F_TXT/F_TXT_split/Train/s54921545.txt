A right chest tube is in unchanged position. There is persistent opacity within the right lung base, which is similar in severity compared to recent prior, likely a combination of post-surgical atelectasis and pleural fluid. Overall aeration of the right lung is unchanged. The left lung remains essentially clear. Post-surgical changes within the left base are noted. There is decreased pulmonary vascular congestion as compared to most recent prior. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. No pneumothorax is identified.
