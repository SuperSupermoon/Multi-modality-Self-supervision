AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular engorgement have improved since ___. Small left pleural effusion and moderate cardiomegaly persist. Extent of bibasilar consolidation difficult to assess given the overlying heavy asbestos-related calcified pleural plaque. Conceivably, a lateral conventional chest radiograph would be helpful in determining how much of the abnormality at the lung bases, particularly the right, is due to pleural effusion and how much due to lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation. Tracheostomy tube is turned, tip abutting the left wall. Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
