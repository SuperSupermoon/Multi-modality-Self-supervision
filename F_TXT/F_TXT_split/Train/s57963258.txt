Since the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, a right pleural catheter remains in place with substantial improvement in a right pneumothorax which is now moderate in size with both apical and basilar components. Diffuse subcutaneous emphysema has worsened. Tip of endotracheal tube terminates within 2 cm of the carina with the neck in a flexed position. Pulmonary vascular congestion and edema have worsened in the interval. Moderate layering left pleural effusion appears more prominent but is difficult to compare due to differences in patient positioning.
