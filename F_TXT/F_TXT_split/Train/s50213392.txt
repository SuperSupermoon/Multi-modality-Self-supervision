The endotracheal tube tip is approximately 2.4 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the expected location of the mid to low superior vena cava. An esophageal catheter terminates in the stomach with side port in the expected location of the gastroesophageal junction or distal esophagus. Additional thin wiring coursing along the expected location of the esophagus and terminating in the left upper quadrant may represent temperature probes, but this is indeterminate on this study; 1 of these wires courses below the diaphragm and loops back superiorly to the level of the inferior heart. Mediastinal clips are seen. Additional metallic density hardware projects over the midline and right hilus. Lung volumes are low, exaggerating heart size. No pneumothorax is detected on this single supine view. There is a small right pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis and perihilar atelectasis is seen. Vascular cephalization may be exaggerated by low lung volumes and supine positioning, but mild pulmonary vascular congestion is a consideration. Irregularity at the lateral right 5th rib may relate to a fracture. Chest CT is pending.
