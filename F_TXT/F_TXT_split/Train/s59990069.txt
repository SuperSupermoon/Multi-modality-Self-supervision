The patient remains intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 2 cm above the carina. There is a left subclavian stent projecting over the left upper chest that appears unchanged. The venous stent appears compressed centrally which may be due to mass effect from adjacent bony structures. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable reflecting a combination of lymphadenopathy and proliferation of mediastinal fat. There is similar perihilar atelectasis on the left and bilateral heterogeneous opacification. Left lower lobe consolidation is not very well assessed on portable AP radiography but left retrocardiac opacification appears similar to perhaps slightly increased.
