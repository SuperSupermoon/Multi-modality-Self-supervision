AP chest compared to ___: Previous pulmonary edema has resolved. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly and central vascular engorgement persist. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Rightward deviation of the mid portion of the cervical trachea is a consistent finding on the only three chest radiographs currently available and suggests mass effect by either a nodule in the region of the left thyroid lobe, or alternatively a Zenker's diverticulum. Clinical correlation is advised.
