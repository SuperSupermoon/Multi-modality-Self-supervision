Lung volumes are extremely low, limiting evaluation. A juxtahilar opacity could represent prominent pulmonary vasculature or a potential pneumonia or hilar mass. No pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion is identified. The heart size is not well evaluated due to positioning and low lung volumes.
