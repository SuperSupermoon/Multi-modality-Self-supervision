Left PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC. The cardiac silhouette size is unchanged, with left ventricular predominance and mild cardiomegaly. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable with calcification of the thoracic aorta again noted. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Partially imaged is a percutaneous transhepatic biliary catheter in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
