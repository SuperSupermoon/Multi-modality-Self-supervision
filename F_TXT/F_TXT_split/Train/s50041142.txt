As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach. On the current radiograph, there is substantial patient rotation, which makes subtle changes difficult to evaluate. However, no larger pleural effusions and no pneumothorax is seen. The size of the cardiac silhouette appears to be unchanged.
