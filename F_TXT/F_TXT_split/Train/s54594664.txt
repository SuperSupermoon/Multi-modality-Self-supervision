Comparison is made with prior study ___. Lines and tubes remain in place in standard position. The NG tube is coiled in the stomach. Right lower lobe opacities are worsened. This could be due to atelectasis, but an aspiration process is also a possibility. New opacities in the left lower lobe are likely atelectases but superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded. If any there is a small right pleural effusion.
