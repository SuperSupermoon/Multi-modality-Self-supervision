AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained one hour earlier during the same day. During the latest interval, a right-sided pigtail-end drainage catheter has been placed apparently approached through the lateral lower chest wall at the level of the seventh or eighth intercostal space. The pig-tail end of the line is overlying the medial portion of the right diaphragm, but it cannot be identified if anterior or posterior on this single-view examination. Also, impossible to decide on the single-view examination if a sharp kink in the line at the site of the entrance makes a shallow or tight loop which possibly could impair flow. Evidence of previously described moderate-sized pneumothorax persists and likewise extensive chest wall emphysema is present bilaterally, extending into the lower neck region. Referring physician, ___, was paged at 1:20 p.m.
