In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in the postoperative appearance of the left hemithorax with chest tube in place. No evidence of pneumothorax. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is again consistent with elevation in pulmonary venous pressure with mild atelectatic changes on the right. The widening of the superior mediastinum is less prominent on the current study. What appears to be an air-fluid level in the mediastinum in the upper esophagus may be less prominent on the current study. A lateral view would be helpful when the condition of the patient permits.
