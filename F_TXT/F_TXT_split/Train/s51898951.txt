AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: New right PIC line passes to the mid SVC, where the tip is partially obscured by a nasogastric tube that is looped in the stomach and ends at the level of the carina in the esophagus. Nasogastric tube was removed on subsequent radiograph available at the time of this dictation, so I made no attempt at position verification. Heart is moderately enlarged. Lungs are filled with multiple nodules and moderately severe pulmonary edema and/or consolidation. Right pleural effusion is small. No pneumothorax or appreciable left pleural effusion.
