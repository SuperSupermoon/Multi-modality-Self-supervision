ET tube in standard placement. Right PIC line ends in the upper right atrium. Nasogastric drainage tube ends in a nondistended stomach. Lung volumes have improved slightly, presumably due to positive pressure ventilator support. Extensive bronchiectasis or bronchiolitis, more severe in the right lung, are little changed. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are small if any. Severe generalized distention of large and small bowel in the upper abdomen has improved slightly.
