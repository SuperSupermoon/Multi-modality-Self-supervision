Radiograph centered at thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessment of a nasogastric tube, which now terminates within the body of the stomach. However, the side port is just above the expected location of the GE junction. Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, dilated loops of bowel are present, in keeping with history of high-grade small bowel obstruction, more fully evaluated by dedicated abdominal series of one day earlier. Previously identified post-operative free intraperitoneal air is less apparent, but positional differences may contribute to this change. Within the lungs, patchy and linear opacities in the right juxtahilar and both basilar regions may reflect atelectasis and/or aspiration.
