NG and ET tubes are in unchanged, standard positions with the NG tube coursing into the upper stomach. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with top-normal heart size, increased in size from the most recent prior study. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs are well expanded. Heterogeneous opacities at the lung bases are improved slightly at the left lung base but worsened on the right lung base and may reflect recent aspiration or pulmonary edema.
