Previous left-sided pneumothorax is not readily apparent. Left chest pacemaker with right ventricular lead is unchanged. Lung volumes are slightly low; however, no opacities concerning for infectious processes are noted. Vague opacity in the left lung just medial to the pacer pack is stable. This non-resolving opacity should be evaluated with a CT on a non-emergent basis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged. No obvious pleural effusions.
