In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Bilateral heterogeneous opacifications are again seen, more prominent on the right. Some of this probably reflects asymmetric pulmonary edema. There also are layering effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases. This appears improved from the previous study, though some of this may merely reflect differences in patient position.
