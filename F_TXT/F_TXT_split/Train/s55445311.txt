Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates ET tube terminating approximately 2 cm above the carina. Limited evaluation due to portable technique and the patient's body habitus. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing through the esophagus and stomach, its tip out of field of view. Lung volumes are low. There is no pneumothorax. No pleural effusion. Prominent hilar and mediastinal silhouettes, most likely relate to the patient's body habitus. Bibasilar consolidations are better assessed on concurrent chest CT
