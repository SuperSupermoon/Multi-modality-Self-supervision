The tip of the endotracheal tube appears appropriate position approximately 3.8 cm above the carinal. An enteric tube is seen traversing the this radiograph, and extending beyond the inferior confines of this radiograph. A left-sided subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the mid portion of the SVC. A left-sided chest tube is present, terminating in the region of the left lung apex. A left-sided pigtail catheter is present, terminating at the left apex as well. There is air seen along the muscles of the left shoulder girdle. Extensive subcutaneous air is also seen on the left. Right-sided first and second rib fractures are seen, there is also suggestion of a left-sided scapular fracture, but better assessed on prior imaging. No definite pneumothorax remains, all limited by technique and overlying artifact. There is retrocardiac opacity, likely related to atelectasis, although with differential of contusion or other airspace disease.
