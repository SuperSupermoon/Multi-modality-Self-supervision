The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tip projects 4 cm above the carina. The tip of the nasogastric tube is located at the level of the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced by approximately 5 cm. The patient has bilateral air inclusions in the soft tissues of the nephrectomy but no pneumothorax is visible. The large right-sided rib lesion known from a CT examination from ___ is not seen on the current image, but the cortical structures of the seventh right rib, at the lateral aspect, are not visible. Also not visible on the current image and documented on the previous CT are the multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules. Presence of a small left pleural effusion is likely.
