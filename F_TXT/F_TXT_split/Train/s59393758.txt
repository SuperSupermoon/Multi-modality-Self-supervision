Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged compared to the prior study. The aorta remains calcified and tortuous. There is mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse in the interval, with continued patchy opacities in the lung bases which are nonspecific. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace pleural effusion. The left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. No pneumothorax is identified.
