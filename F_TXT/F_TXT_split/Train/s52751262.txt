A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained. A moderate-sized pneumothorax is present on the left. There is no appreciable pneumothorax on the right. There is extensive pneumomediastinum tracking into the soft tissues of the neck. As seen on the previous CT abdomen from the same day, the free air apparently originates from the retroperitoneum. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted. There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusion.
