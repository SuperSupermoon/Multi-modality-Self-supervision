AP chest compared to ___: Severe cardiomegaly is even more pronounced, but lungs are clear and pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Right PIC line passes at least as far as the origin of the SVC where it is obscured by both a transvenous pacer defibrillator lead, which ends high in the right ventricle, and a superficial EKG lead. No pneumothorax or pleural abnormality.
