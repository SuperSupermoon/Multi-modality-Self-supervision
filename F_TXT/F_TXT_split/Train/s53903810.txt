In comparison with the study of ___, there is apparent increase in pleural fluid bilaterally, especially on the right with basilar atelectatic changes. There is some increased engorgement of pulmonary vessels, consistent with increasing pulmonary venous pressure. Again there is prominence of the superior mediastinum, which probably is related to the chronic SVC obstruction with collateral vessels seen on the recent CT scan.
