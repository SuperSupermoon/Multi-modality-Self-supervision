Single supine portable view of the chest was obtained. Underlying trauma board and external artifact partially obscure the view. Given this, no focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Evidence of at least two old right-sided rib fractures is noted.
