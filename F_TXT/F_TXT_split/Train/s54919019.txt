Chronic right apical pleural thickening and post-surgical and post-radiation changes are redemonstrated with small apical cavity, unchanged in appearance. Bilateral right greater than left moderate-to-large pleural effusions may be slightly increased with right and left chest tubes again noted. No pneumothorax is seen with perhaps mild vascular congestion in the aerated portion of the left lung. Cardiomediastinal contours are not well assessed.
