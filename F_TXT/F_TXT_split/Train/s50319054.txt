Left-sided porta catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Prominence of the left hilum is difficult to evaluate on this single portable projection and CT could be considered to help differentiate asymmetric vasculature from lymphadenopathy if warranted clinically. Lungs are clear and there is no pleural effusion.
