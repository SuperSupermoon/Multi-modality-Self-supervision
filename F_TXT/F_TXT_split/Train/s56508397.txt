Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has resolved. Left lower lobe consolidation began developing on ___ and has been severe, without improvement since ___. Since the mediastinum remains shifted to the left I suspect this is largely atelectasis, although concurrent pneumonia is not excluded. It suggests poor clearance of secretions, perhaps due to bronchial occlusion or weekend diaphragm or cough reflex. Clinical correlation advised. There is no appreciable pleural effusion, heart size is normal. Tracheostomy tube is midline.
