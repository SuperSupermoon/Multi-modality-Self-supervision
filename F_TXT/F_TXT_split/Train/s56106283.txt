In comparison with the study of ___, there are again bilateral basilar opacifications, which appear more plate like on the left. No definite pneumonia, though this would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting. Allowing for differences in obliquity, there is probably little change in the appearance of the monitoring and support devices. Dense calcification of the left hilar lymph nodes is again seen.
