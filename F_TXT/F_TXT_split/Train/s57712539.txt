AP upright portable chest radiograph was provided. A right chest wall Port-A-Cath is again seen with its tip residing at the level of the low SVC. Study is underpenetrated thus limiting evaluation. Allowing for this, no definite signs of pneumonia or overt CHF. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The bony structures appear intact.
