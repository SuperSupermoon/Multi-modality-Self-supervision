There has been interval placement of a right-sided Pleurx catheter and while the pleural effusion on that side is essentially drained, there is a small-to-moderate pneumothorax now present. There is no flattening of the hemidiaphragms or mediastinal shift to suggest tension. The left-sided pleural effusion has increased, now moderate to large in size with underlying atelectasis. Additionally a large hiatal hernia is present. The aerated portions of lung show little change from prior exam. Severe degenerative changes are present at both glenohumeral joints.
