A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is notable for moderate cardiomegaly, similar to the prior examination. Increased bilateral opacities in a perihilar distribution and thickening of the minor fissure is consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Small pleural effusions are not excluded. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
