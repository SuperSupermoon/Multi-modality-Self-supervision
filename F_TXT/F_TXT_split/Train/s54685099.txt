Heart size is normal. The aorta remains mildly tortuous. Mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable. Hyperinflation of the lungs with relative attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices is compatible with emphysema. Rounded ill-defined opacity within the periphery of the right upper lobe measuring up to 3.9 cm may reflect the patient's known malignancy. Patchy ill-defined opacification within the right lung, particularly of the right lung base, could reflect infection. Scattered calcified granulomas are noted in the periphery of the left lower lobe. Hilar contours are otherwise relatively unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Mild right apical and lateral pleural thickening or fluid is noted. No left-sided pleural effusion is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
