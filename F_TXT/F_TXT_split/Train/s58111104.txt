There are no areas of clear abnormality in the lungs, but there are 2 which could be subtle infection. 1 is a roughly 2 cm wide ring shadow projecting lateral to the left hilus at the level of the third anterior interspace neck could be a cavity. This region has been questionable on several prior chest radiographs. I am not sure if it is real. The second it is a region of increased radiodensity projecting over the right cardiophrenic sulcus. This is a region where mediastinal fat can simulate lung abnormalities. Chest CT scanning would be definitive in assessing the lungs and detecting infection. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
