As compared to the previous radiograph, the course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged. The endotracheal tube is not visualized and might have been removed in the interval. The lung volumes have increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. Better seen than on the previous radiograph is a right medial basal opacity with several air bronchograms. This opacity might represent atelectasis, but the possibility of early pneumonia cannot be excluded. Close radiographic followup is recommended.
