The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 5.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates probably just short of the left hemidiaphragmatic inlet. A streaky left mid lung opacity suggests minor atelectasis. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear within the limitations of technique. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
