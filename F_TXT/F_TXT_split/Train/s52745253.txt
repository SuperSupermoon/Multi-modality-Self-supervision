The exam is suboptimal due to patient motion. A left-sided jugular central venous catheter is seen, distal portion not well seen, but possibly terminating just distal to the left internal jugular/brachiocephalic junction. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable, given differences in inspiration the stable prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggests moderate pulmonary congestion although not well assessed. No large focal consolidation or pleural effusion.
