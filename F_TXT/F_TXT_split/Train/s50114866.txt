ET tube tip lies approximately 2.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Right-sided chest tube is present. Right subclavian central line tip lies in the region of the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax is detected. There is rotated positioning as well suspected right convex thoracic scoliosis. Allowing for this, there is probable mild cardiomegaly. Increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. Probable small left effusion. Vascular markings are diffusely prominent, suggesting presence of CHF. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle without gross effusion. No frank consolidation is seen in the right lung. Small amount of pleural fluid and/or thickening is seen at the left-greater-than-right lung apices. Assessment for rib fractures is quite limited on these views.
