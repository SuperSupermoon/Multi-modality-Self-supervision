Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bilateral subsegmental atelectasis. Allowing for this, there is likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema. Retrocardiac opacification may represent atelectasis or early consolidation depending on the clinical setting. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal contour is stable. The osseous structures are unremarkable. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt tubing and a tracheostomy tube project in unchanged location. A radiodensity projecting over the mid abdomen may represent a G-tube.
