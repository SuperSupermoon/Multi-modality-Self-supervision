As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal increase in extent and severity of the pre-existing bilateral, right basal and left perihilar parenchymal opacity. The morphology and location of the opacities suggest a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia. The size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be enlarged. There is no pleural effusion. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
