AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are appreciably lower today accounting in part for some of the apparent increase in caliber of the already widened mediastinum, which is probably stable mediastinal venous engorgement presumably due to volume overload. I doubt there is pulmonary edema. Small right pleural effusion is new or newly apparent. No pneumothorax. Bilateral infrahilar opacification is probably atelectasis.
