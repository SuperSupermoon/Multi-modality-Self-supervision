There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema but no focal opacity suggestive of pneumonia. Apparent opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle is felt to represent summation of bronchovascular bundles with the posterior ribs. Moderate cardiomegaly is present. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta are seen. Bony callus from old right clavicular fracture is also noted.
