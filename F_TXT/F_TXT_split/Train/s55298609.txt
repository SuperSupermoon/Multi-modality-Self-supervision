AP chest reviewed in the absence of recent chest radiographs. ET tube, right internal jugular line, and nasogastric tube are in standard placements respectively. In addition to a widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality that could be pulmonary edema, there is more focal consolidation and a strong suggestion of cavitation in the juxtahilar right lung, pneumonia until proved otherwise. Since the heart is normal size and pleural effusion is small, if any, this could be noncardiac edema. No pneumothorax.
