In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube, with its tip above the clavicular level, approximately 8.4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the body of the stomach, then coils back on itself so that the tip lies in the fundus close to the level of the esophagogastric junction. Pulling back this tube would effectively allow the tip to extend to the distal stomach. Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
