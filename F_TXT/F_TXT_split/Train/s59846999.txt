As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right-sided chest tube and a pericardial drain. Previously drain was removed. The right-sided effusion is completely resolved, the presence of a minimal right apical pneumothorax in millimetric ___ cannot be excluded. The size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally decreased. The pre-existing left pleural effusion appears minimally increased as compared to the previous image. No evidence of pneumonia, minimal fluid overload might be present.
