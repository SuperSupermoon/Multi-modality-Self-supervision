Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Transvenous pacemaker leads are in standard positions. Right supraclavicular central catheter tip is in the right atrium. Left IJ catheter tip cannot be accurately assessed and is obscured by the other leads and catheters. Mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent lung consolidation and mild fluid overload are stable. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
