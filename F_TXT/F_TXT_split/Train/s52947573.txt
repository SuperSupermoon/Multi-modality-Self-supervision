Interval intubation with an endotracheal tube which terminates 2.3 cm above the carina and placement of a right IJ central venous catheter which terminates near the cavoatrial junction. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. Apparent mediastinal widening is likely exaggerated by patient rotation, unchanged compared to ___. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No focal airspace opacity. No pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. A left pectoralis single chamber cardiac pacemaker is again noted with a lead that terminates likely within the right ventricle. Mild thoracic levoscoliosis is noted. Prominent gaseous distention of the stomach should not be mistaken for free air under the diaphragm.
