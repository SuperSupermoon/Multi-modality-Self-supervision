In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4 cm above the Carina. Nasogastric tube extends at least to the upper to mid body of the stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the image. Opacification in the left lower lung is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. Right basilar atelectatic changes also seen with small effusion.
