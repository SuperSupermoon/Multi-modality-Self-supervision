Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. After placement of the right catheter, there is interval decrease in the right pleural effusion which is still at least moderate, but most likely large. There is compressive atelectasis of the right lower lung. The heart is more central in position, reflecting the decrease in the pleural effusion on the right. There is minimal amount of vascular engorgement. There is no appreciable pneumothorax.
