In comparison to prior radiograph from earlier the same date, there has been slight worsening of bilateral pulmonary opacities. Areas of more confluent opacity in the right mid and both lower lungs could potentially be due to asymmetrical edema but coexisting infectious pneumonia is possible in the setting of fever. No other relevant change.
