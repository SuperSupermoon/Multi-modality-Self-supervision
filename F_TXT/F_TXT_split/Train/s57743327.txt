Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears borderline enlarged. Additionally, low lung volumes cause apparent widening of the superior mediastinum, but the aortic knob appears distinct. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted without overt pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
