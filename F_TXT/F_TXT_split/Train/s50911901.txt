Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard position with no evidence of pneumothorax on the supine study. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for patient rotation. New left perihilar airspace opacities have developed, and may be due to the clinically suspected diagnosis of acute aspiration. Previously present right juxtahilar opacities have slightly worsened centrally and could be due to worsening infection with or without superimposed aspiration. Left basilar opacity has improved, and small pleural effusions have slightly decreased.
