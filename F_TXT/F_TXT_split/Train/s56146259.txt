Single portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates approximately 2.8 cm above the level of the carina, and could be retracted approximately 2 cm for ideal positioning. A nasogastric tube courses through the esophagus, below the diaphragms, and terminates in the fundus of the stomach. Bilateral airspace consolidations compatible with pneumonia are unchanged.
