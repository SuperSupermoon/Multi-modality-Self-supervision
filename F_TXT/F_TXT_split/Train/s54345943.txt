Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval decrease in size of the still large right-sided pleural effusion with persistent collapse of the right lower lobe and persistent shift of the mediastinum to the right. Again seen are stable-appearing diffuse interstitial opacities consistent with mild pulmonary edema or lymphangitic spread of cancer. There is a stable-appearing small left-sided pleural effusion. Multiple nodules are seen in the left lung field. A right VP shunt catheter is seen coursing along the right chest and into the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. A right-sided pigtail catheter projects over the right hemithorax. There is a tiny right-sided apical pneumothorax.
