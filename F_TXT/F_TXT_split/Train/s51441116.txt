Single portable view of the chest. Lung volumes are lower on the current exam. There is blunting of the lateral costophrenic angles bilaterally which could be due to overlying soft tissues, although underlying effusions would be difficult to exclude. Superiorly, the lungs are clear. There is no evidence of focal consolidation. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged given differences in technique and positioning, noting rotation to the right. Absorption of the distal right clavicle and chronic deformity of the right humeral head are again noted, not significantly changed dating back to ___.
