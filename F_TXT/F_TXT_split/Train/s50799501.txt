As compared to the prior study of earlier the same date, a Swan-Ganz catheter has been repositioned more centrally in the right hilum. Multifocal lung consolidation is again demonstrated (involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left) as well as moderate to large right and moderate left pleural effusions. Apparent air-fluid level in the right mid lung region is new, and could potentially represent a loculated hydro pneumothorax or a pneumatocele or potentially a lung abscess. Left lateral decubitus radiograph of the right lung may be considered for initial further evaluation of this finding if warranted clinically
