NEW CONSOLIDATION IN THE LEFT MID LUNG COULD BE PNEUMONIA OR RE-EXPANSION EDEMA IF THORACENTESIS WAS LARGE VOLUME. THERE IS NO PNEUMOTHORAX. PLEURAL FLUID AND THICKENING IN THE LEFT LOWER CHEST ARE LONG-STANDING, EXPLAINING CHRONIC ATELECTASIS, WHICH LOOKS WORSE TODAY THAN ON ___, THE MOST RECENT PRIOR CHEST RADIOGRAPH. NEW CONSOLIDATION IN THE LEFT MID LUNG, COULD BE ATELECTASIS OR RE-EXPANSION EDEMA, IF THE VOLUME OF THORACENTESIS WAS APPRECIABLE, BUT IT COULD BE PNEUMONIA. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NO RADIOGRAPHS TAKEN PRIOR TO THE REPORTED THORACENTESIS. CHEST CT ON ___ SHOWED ARELATIVELY SMALL LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION. .
