Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and is accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal interstitial edema. Hazy increased opacity in right mid and lower lung could reflect a layering effusion on this semi-upright study, but it is difficult to exclude underlying consolidation at the right lung base. Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard. Small left pleural effusion is also noted.
