A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates opacity projecting over the right lower lung, likely within the right middle lobe. This is compatible with pneumonia, which could be related to aspiration. Additional opacity chest lateral to the left heart border may reflect atelectasis versus an additional focus of aspiration pneumonia. There is a small right pleural effusion and mild vascular congestion. No pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
