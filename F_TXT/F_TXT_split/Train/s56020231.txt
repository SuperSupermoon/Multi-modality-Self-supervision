The left-sided indwelling catheter is again noted, tip over SVC/RA junction. A Dobbhoff type tube is present, tip overlying gastric fundus. Note is made that a portion of the Dobbhoff tube is not visualized as it extends below the inferior edge of the film. No pneumothorax is detected. Mild cardiomegaly is similar to prior. There is upper zone redistribution with vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is a layering hazy opacity at right base that likely reflects a layering small pleural effusion with mild underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Aside from minimal atelectasis and equivocal minimal blunting left costophrenic angle, the left base grossly clear. No free air detected beneath the diaphragm.
