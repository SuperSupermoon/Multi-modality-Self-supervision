The overall size of a moderate right-sided pneumothorax appears fairly similar to the recent prior examination, but there is apparent new mild shift of mediastinal structures toward the left. Although this may be an artifact associated with slight differences in orientation of the chest with respect to the film, the appearance raises concern early developing tension pneumothorax. Otherwise, there has been no significant change. Findings discussed at the time of interpretation with Ms. ___ at 2:30 p.m. by telephone; by that time a chest tube insertion had already been performed to treat the pneumothorax.
