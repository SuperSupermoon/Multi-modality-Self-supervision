A PICC line has been removed. The patient is status post sternotomy. Dense mitral annular calcifications are again present. The heart is moderately enlarged. There is similar relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Lung volumes are low. On the right, blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus is again noted making it difficult to exclude a small pleural effusion. Confluent opacification is noted in the left retrocardiac region with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. Accordingly, parenchymal opacification is suspected and a pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. Pneumonia or atelectasis could explain the findings. Persistent apical pleural thickening on the left may reflect slight scarring, which appears unchanged.
