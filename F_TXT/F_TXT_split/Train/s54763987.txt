CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___, earlier the same day, the NG tube appears to have been advanced. The tip now overlies the gastric fundus. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Markedly comminuted, ununited left proximal humerus fracture noted, with surrounding callus/heterotopic ossification.
