Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, with associated pulmonary vascular congestion and perihilar haziness. More confluent opacities at the bases have worsened compared to the prior study, and could reflect dependent pulmonary edema, but other coexisting process such as aspiration or infectious pneumonia are also possible in the appropriate clinical settings. Small-to-moderate layering pleural effusions are also demonstrated, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
