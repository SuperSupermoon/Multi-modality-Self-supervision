The right IJ central venous catheter has been removed. The right PICC line, right pigtail catheter, and NG tube are unchanged. The cardiac silhouette is quite enlarged, perhaps due to right paracardiac or paramediastinal pleural loculation or pericardial effusion. Left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged, and there may be a small left pleural effusion.
