AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging: Greater opacification of the left lower hemithorax than the right is due to abnormality in the left lower lobe, possibly pneumonia and/or posteriorly layering small to moderate left pleural effusion. Conventional radiographs would be helpful in discriminating between these possibilities. Right lung grossly clear. Heart size normal.
