AP chest compared to ___, 11:52 a.m.: What was predominantly a bibasilar infiltrative abnormality, left greater than right, is now more pronounced in the right lung, particularly upper lobe. Heart size is normal but slightly larger and therefore this could be pulmonary edema, but the asymmetry, particularly sparing of the left upper lobe raised possibility of widespread infection or even pulmonary hemorrhage. Pleural effusion is small if any.
