In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a right IJ catheter that extends to the lower portion of the SVC. Nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube remain in satisfactory position. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, without definite vascular congestion or pleural effusion. There is suggestion of a patchy area of increased opacification in the right mid zone. This may represent a combination of pulmonary vessels with overlying scapula or streaks of atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, developing consolidation could be considered.
