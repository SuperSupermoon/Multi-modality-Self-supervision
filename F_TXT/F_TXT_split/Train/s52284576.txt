Rotated positioning. A tracheostomy tube is in place. A right IJ central line tip lies in the region of the SVC/RA junction. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged. There is upper zone re-distribution and diffuse vascular blurring, raising the question of CHF/fluid overload. The right costophrenic sulcus remains clear. There is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged.
