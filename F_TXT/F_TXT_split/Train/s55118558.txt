Compared to the most recent prior examination, there has been re-adjustment of the left internal jugular central venous catheter, with the tip now in the mid SVC. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt interstitial edema. There is a new small left pleural effusion. No consolidation or pneumothorax is evident. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged.
