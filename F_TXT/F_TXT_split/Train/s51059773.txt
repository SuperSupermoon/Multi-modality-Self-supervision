There are multifocal airspace opacities, particularly in the left mid lung and at the right lung base, which may be due to infection. Old healed right rib fractures are incidentally noted. There is no pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly despite the projection is present. Mild indentation of the right lateral wall of the upper trachea may be due to an enlarged right thyroid lobe. Clinical correlation including palpation is suggested.
