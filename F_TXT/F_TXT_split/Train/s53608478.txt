As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in constant position. Lung volumes remain to be low and areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases have slightly increased in extent. There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting mild pleural effusion. No other changes. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.
