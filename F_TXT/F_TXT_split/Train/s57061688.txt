A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates multiple knee mediastinal clips and sternal wires, unchanged in position. A left internal jugular approach catheter is unchanged in position. There has been interval removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes. There is again cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema, which overall appears similar to the most recent chest radiograph. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, are also unchanged. No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.
