Moderate cardiomegaly appears similar to prior examination though complete comparison is difficult given the presence of a moderate-to-large right subpulmonic pleural effusion as well as increased density in the right lung base, which may represent pneumonia. Prominent right hilar contour suggests lymphadenopathy. There is central vascular congestion along with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion. Surgical clips project over the right axilla. The patient is status post right mastectomy.
