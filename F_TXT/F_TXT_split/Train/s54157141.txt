1. Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which has its tip approximately 2.7 cm above the carina. The right Swan-Ganz catheter now has its tip in the right pulmonary artery. Nasogastric tube is not visualized. Stable postoperative appearance to the cardiac and mediastinal contours. Moderate layering bilateral pleural effusions with relatively diminished lung volumes associated with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. No overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity of detecting pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
