Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is cardiomegaly, which is stable. There is sclerosis of the thoracic aorta. There are again seen airspace opacities most prominent within the lung bases, left greater than right. Underlying infiltrates in those locations cannot be entirely excluded. The opacification at the lung bases more confluent. There is also prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings, may represent an element of fluid overload.
