As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an unchanged status post aortic repair. Bilateral chest tubes are seen. The current image shows an unchanged right pneumothorax and an unchanged left pneumothorax. An airway stent is visible, but has, so far, not contributed to a substantial expansion of the collapsed left lung. There is unchanged evidence of mediastinal shift towards the left.
