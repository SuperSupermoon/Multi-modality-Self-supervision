A single portable chest radiograph was obtained. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.6 cm above the carina. The orogastric tube extends inferiorly out of the field of view and may course upwards toward the fundus of the stomach. The lungs are diffusely opacified by airspace densities. A retrocardiac left lower lobe opacity obscures the left hemidiaphragm. A right pleural effusion is better seen on the subsequently acquired CT. Enlargement of the mediastinum is exaggerated by AP technique. There is no pneumothorax.
