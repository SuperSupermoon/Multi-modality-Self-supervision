Right subclavian PICC line in the proximal SVC. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There has been interval improvement in the patchy opacities predominantly within the right lung but also scattered in the left lung. Findings are consistent with resolving edema rather than an infectious process. No pneumothorax.
