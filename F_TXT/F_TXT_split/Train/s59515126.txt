Portable AP radiograph of the chest view was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The ET tube tip is approximately 4.3 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Left subclavian line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Bibasal atelectasis is noted although infection in this area cannot be entirely excluded. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
