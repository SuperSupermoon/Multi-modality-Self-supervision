As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change in extent of the right basal and left basal parenchymal opacities and the right basal consolidation, associated with volume loss. The morphology of the changes continue to be highly suspicious for pneumonia, as emphasized in the previous report. The presence of a small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No overt pulmonary edema. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette and the mediastinum.
