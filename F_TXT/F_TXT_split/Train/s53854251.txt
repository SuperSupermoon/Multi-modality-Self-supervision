The ___ radiograph shows a single lead from a left pectoral pacemaker projecting over the right ventricle. There is no pneumothorax. A right PICC line terminates in the upper right atrium near the cavoatrial junction. Withdrawal by 1-2 cm would position its tip at the cavoatrial junction if desired. Mild pulmonary edema has slightly increased. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged. A small left pleural effusion is likely present. Increased retrocardiac airspace opacification may be due to atelectasis or infection. Previous cervical spine fusion is partially imaged. The followup PA and lateral radiographs from ___ confirm a left lower lobe airspace opacity, which is most likely due to pneumonia. There is also increased mild pulmonary edema.
