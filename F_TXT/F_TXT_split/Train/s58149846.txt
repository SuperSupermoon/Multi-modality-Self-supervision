1. Endotracheal tube has its tip just 1.6 cm above the carina. Repositioning with pull back of approximately 2 cm would be advised. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Lung volumes are low. There is prominence of the pulmonary vascularity, which likely reflects a component of mild pulmonary edema. In addition, there is opacity at the left base which may reflect a combination of pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity of detecting pneumothorax is diminished on the supine radiograph. Heart remains upper limits of normal in size given portable technique. Results of this examination were phoned to the patient's nurse, ___ on ___ at 9:10 a.m. The nurse reports that the ___ are aware and have already pulled back the endotracheal tube.
