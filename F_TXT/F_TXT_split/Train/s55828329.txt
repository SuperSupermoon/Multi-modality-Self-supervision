There has been prior median sternotomy. The heart remains enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded. There has been interval improvement in aeration. However, there is fullness OF the perihilar vasculature suggesting mild perihilar and interstitial edema. No large effusions are seen. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Focal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac area could reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. Clinical correlation is advised.
