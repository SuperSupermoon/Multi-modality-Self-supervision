Indwelling monitoring and support devices are stable and in appropriate position. Lung volumes are extremely low with increased diffuse opacification which may represent vascular crowding and atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes or mild pulmonary edema. Opacification of the left costophrenic angle suggests a layering pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
