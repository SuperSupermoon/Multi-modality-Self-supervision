The chest radiograph dated ___ shows a slight change in the position of the left apical chest tube, which now terminates at the superior border of the left clavicle. The right subclavian central venous line is unchanged, terminating in low SVC. The slightly bent appearance of the line where it enters the chest wall is unchanged. Aeration of the left lung has substantially improved with re-expansion of the lung and resultant rightward shift of the heart and mediastinum. The right lung remains clear. There is a small residual left pneumothorax. Metallic foreign bodies are again noted. The followup radiograph dated ___ shows increased left lung atelectasis, and a persistent moderate left pneumothorax. There is no other significant interval change.
