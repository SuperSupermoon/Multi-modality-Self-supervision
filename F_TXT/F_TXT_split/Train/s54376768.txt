AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained seven hours earlier during the same day. Position of the right-sided chest tube is unaltered. Again the right-sided minimal residual pneumothorax is barely visible. Airation of lung tissue, mild elevation of right-sided diaphragm appears unchanged.
