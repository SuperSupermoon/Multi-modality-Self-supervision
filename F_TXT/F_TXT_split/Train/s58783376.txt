Endotracheal tube tip is 4.8 cm from the carina. Enteric tube passes below the field of view. Right PICC tip seen in the mid SVC. There is increased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax suggesting layering effusion. Retrocardiac opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, potentially combination of effusion atelectasis or consolidation. Superimposed pulmonary vascular congestion is also suspected. Prominence of the upper cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by supine positioning. Prosthetic aortic valve and median sternotomy wires are noted.
