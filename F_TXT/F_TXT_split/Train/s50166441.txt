There has been interval placement of a left-sided pleural pigtail catheter. A portion of it just upstream from the pigtail appears to be kinked on this frontal view, although a lateral view may be helpful in determining the validity of that. There has been improvement of the left-sided pleural effusion with only a minimal amount of residual pleural fluid left. There is no pneumothorax. There has been improvement of the left basal atelectasis. Mild consolidation at the right costophrenic angle is also present. Otherwise, the mediastinal contours are unchanged.
