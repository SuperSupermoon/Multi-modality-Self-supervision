There is also a vague opacity obscuring the lateral margin of the left hemidiaphragm. Otherwise, cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Bilateral apical pleural parenchymal scarring is noted, more prominent in the left upper lobe. Bilateral severe degenerative changes of the shoulder joints are noted.
