As compared to ___, left pleural catheter remains in place with a persistent moderate-sized left pleural effusion adjacent to an elevated left hemidiaphragm. Medially loculated hydro pneumothorax component is likely unchanged. Heterogeneous opacities in the left lung have improved in the interval. Right lung is clear except for minor atelectasis at the right base. Previously evident free intraperitoneal air is less apparent, possibly due to positional differences.
