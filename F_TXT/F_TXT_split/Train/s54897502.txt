The endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina, unchanged. The enteric tube port is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction and could be safely advanced 5-10 cm for positioning within the stomach. The lung volumes are slightly increased. Aeration of the left lung base is improved. Linear atelectasis is seen in the right mid lung. The heart is moderately enlarged but unchanged. Evidence of central vascular congestion persists. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
