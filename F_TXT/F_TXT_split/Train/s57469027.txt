Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. Nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There is right paratracheal soft tissue thickening and patchy airspace process involving the right upper lobe which likely represents a combination of post-obstructive pneumonia and known lung malignancy. More streaky opacities at the right lung base may reflect post-inflammatory scarring or subsegmental atelectasis. The left lung appears grossly clear. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Heart is within normal limits in size. Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the consolidative process in the right upper lung. No pneumothorax.
