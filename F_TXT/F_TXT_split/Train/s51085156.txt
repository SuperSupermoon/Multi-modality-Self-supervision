The inspiratory lung volumes are low. There is increased opacification at the lung bases, left greater than the right. The costophrenic angles are blunted, compatible with small pleural effusions, greater on the left. There is mild pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated. The mediastinal contours appear prominent, which is related in part to technique. Within the right upper abdomen, a percutaneous nephrostomy tube is noted.
