Single portable view of the chest. No prior. There are bibasilar opacities, larger on the left than right. These are suggestive of pleural effusions with probable underlying airspace opacity as well. There is engorgement of the central pulmonary vasculature with indistinct pulmonary vascular markings peripherally. Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged; however, is not well seen secondary to silhouetting from airspace disease. Osseous and soft tissue structures are grossly unremarkable.
