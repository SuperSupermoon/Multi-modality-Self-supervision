AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The previously identified right-sided pleural effusion remains unchanged. It appears sizable as it obliterates completely the right-sided diaphragm and extends along the lateral chest wall on the right side. It also obscures the right middle lobe and lower lobe area, so a possible underlying pulmonary abnormality in this area cannot be excluded. The left hemithorax is grossly unremarkable on this portable chest examination in semi-upright position.
