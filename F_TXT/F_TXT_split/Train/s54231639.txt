As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has an unchanged left central venous access line and a tracheostomy tube. The nasogastric tube has been removed in the interval. There is minimally improved ventilation of the lung bases, notably on the right, but bilateral pleural effusions with subsequent atelectasis persist. Unchanged mild fluid overload. No new focal parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
