Semi-erect portable AP view of the chest are provided. There has been interval placement of a endotracheal tube which terminates approximately 1.9 cm above the carina. There is no pneumothorax. An enteric tube projects below the left hemidiaphragm and terminates in the expected location of the stomach. Lung volumes are low and causes crowding in the central bronchovascular structures. Opacities in the lung bases likely represents atelectasis. There is no large effusion. Imaged osseous structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
