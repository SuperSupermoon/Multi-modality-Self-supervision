Study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. The heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates mild atherosclerotic calcification of the arch. The hilar contours are unremarkable, and there is no pulmonary edema. Minimal patchy opacity within the right lung base may reflect atelectasis. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. Numerous rib fractures are seen bilaterally which appear chronic. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
