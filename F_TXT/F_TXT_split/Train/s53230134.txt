Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position, with successful repositioning of endotracheal tube, with tip now terminating about 4.5 cm above the carina. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Lungs are grossly clear except for minimal patchy opacities at the left lung base, which could reflect patchy atelectasis, and less likely focal aspiration or an early focus of infectious pneumonia. Probable small left pleural effusion. No visible pneumothorax.
