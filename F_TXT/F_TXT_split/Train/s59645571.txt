There has been interval placement of a left basilar chest tube with tip terminating within the medial aspect of the left hemi thorax. Subcutaneous emphysema is noted in the left lateral chest wall. Known left sided pneumothorax is not well delineated on this supine exam, however there is continued subtle lucency within the left lung base. No rightward shift of mediastinal structures is present. Endotracheal tube remains in standard position. The orogastric tube again terminates at the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced for optimal positioning. Remainder of the examination is unchanged.
