CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Rotated lordotic positioning. A right-sided central line tip overlies the lower right IJ immediately proximal to its confluence with the subclavian. The patient is status post sternotomy with prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, slightly improved. Streaky lucencies along the left mediastinum have also resolved, suggesting resolution of mediastinal air. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. More patchy opacities at both lung bases are present, possibly slightly improved at the left base. No gross effusion identified.
