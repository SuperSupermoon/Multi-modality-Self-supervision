In comparison with study of ___, following bronchoscopy, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. The extensive opacification at the right base has decreased, consistent with some removal of mucus plug and improved aeration of the right lower lung. However, there is now a dense triangular streak of atelectasis in the right mid zone. Left hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen on this study, though some of this could merely reflect the AP position of the patient.
