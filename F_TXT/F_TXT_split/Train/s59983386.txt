The radiograph from 20:32 hours shows no change in the position of pre-existing bilateral chest tubes, right subclavian central venous catheter, and metallic fragments from the known gunshot wounds. The left lung remains almost completely atelectatic with increased leftward deviation of the heart and mediastinum, indicating worsening atelectasis. A pneumothorax is still present. The right lung remains clear, and the tiny right apical pneumothorax is stable. The followup radiograph from 21:46 hours shows worsening near complete left lung atelectasis and an increased left pneumothorax. The patient has also been intubated, and the endotracheal tube tip is just distal to the clavicles. The tiny right apical pneumothorax has resolved. The most recent radiograph from ___ hours shows marked re-expansion of the left lung with substantial decrease in the left pneumothorax, which has essentially resolved. There is now a combination of left midlung subsegmental atelectasis and re-expansion pulmonary edema. The right lung remains clear.
