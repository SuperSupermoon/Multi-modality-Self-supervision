Severe global pulmonary consolidation continues to worsen. The precise contributions of cardiac and non cardiac edema and widespread pulmonary hemorrhage are radiographically indeterminate. ET tube, right PIC line, left internal jugular line, and upper GI drainage tubes are all in standard positions. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion is presumed, but not large.
