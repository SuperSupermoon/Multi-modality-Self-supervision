Compared to the prior study, there has been decrease in the size of the right-sided effusion. A small-to-moderate moderate-sized effusion appears to still be present. There is underlying collapse and/or consolidation. No pneumothorax is detected on this upright view. The mediastinum remains grossly midline and left lung remains grossly clear, with minimal atelectasis at the left base and possible trace blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
