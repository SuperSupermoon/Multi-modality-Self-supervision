Right apical pleural loculation appears smaller, but the I think this is an artifact of change in patient position rather than real drainage. Pleural drainage catheters are unchanged in their respective positions and a smaller basal component of right pleural effusion persists, probably responsible for persistent basal atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Right PIC line ends no less than below the estimated location of the superior cavoatrial junction. Left lung clear. Heart size normal.
