As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube was removed. There is minimal reaccumulation of pleural fluid, although limited to the right lung bases. The partly intrafissural portion of pleural effusion on the left is projecting in a slightly different manner, but is unchanged in extent and severity. The appearance of the cardiac silhouette is constant. Unchanged atelectasis at the right lung bases. No other parenchymal opacity.
