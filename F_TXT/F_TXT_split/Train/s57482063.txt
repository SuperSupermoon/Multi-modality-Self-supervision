AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Extensive opacification in the left lung has changed in distribution but not in overall severity. It is still more abnormal on the right, although there is increasing consolidation in the right lower lobe. It is very difficult to determine whether this is asymmetric edema, possibly reflecting patient positioning or whether the patient has active pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. Heart has never been enlarged and pleural effusions are small if any. Dual-channel dialysis catheter ends in the right atrium. Some patients in renal failure, will have markedly asymmetric patterns of pulmonary edema or transient pulmonary hemorrhage following heparinization for dialysis, and either of these phenomena might be at work in this patient.
