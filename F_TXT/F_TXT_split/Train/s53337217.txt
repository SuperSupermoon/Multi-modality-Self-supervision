In comparison to the recent prior study, there is no significant change. Tracheostomy tube and right PICC line are unchanged in position. Pacemaker, sternotomy wires, and multiple surgical clips projecting over the upper abdomen. Opacification along the right lower lung medially and left lower lung laterally is unchanged and probably represents atelectasis. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
