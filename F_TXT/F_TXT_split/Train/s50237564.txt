As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased of the extubation. The other monitoring and support devices are in constant position. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities at the right lung bases and in the left perihilar areas are minimally more severe in extensive than on the previous image. No new opacities are visualized. Minimal fluid overload is present.
