Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There is complete collapse of the left lower lobe, and mild atelectasis at the right lower lobe. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The nasogastric tube is seen coursing into the stomach and out of the field of view.
