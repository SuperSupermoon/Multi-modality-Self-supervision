Overlying trauma board slightly limits assessment. A right mainstem bronchial intubation is present with the tip of the endotracheal tube at the proximal right mainstem bronchus. Enteric tube tip terminates within the stomach. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Widening of the mediastinum may reflect low lung volumes and supine positioning. Crowding of the bronchovascular markings is noted, likely due to low lung volumes. There appears to be hazy ill-defined opacities within both lungs, more so on the left. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No displaced fractures are visualized.
