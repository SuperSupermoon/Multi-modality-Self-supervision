Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates hyperexpanded lungs. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged; the heart obscures at least ___% of the lungs. Mild increased interstitial markings and engorged pulmonary vasculature suggest mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions are new over the interval. No pneumothorax.
