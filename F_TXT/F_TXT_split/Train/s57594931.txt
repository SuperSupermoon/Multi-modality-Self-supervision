A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an unchanged cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is again extensive bilateral pleural disease, with thickening and fibrosis at the lung apices. Volume loss on the left is unchanged. There is increased thickening in walls of chronic right apical cystic scarring and bronchiectasis. There is likely a small left pleural effusion superimposed on chronic pleural thickening. Increased opacity in the right lower lung is new, and is concerning for pneumonia.
