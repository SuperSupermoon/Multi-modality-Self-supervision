1. Right subclavian PICC line is in place with its tip in the proximal SVC. Right lung is grossly clear. On the left, there are patchy opacities predominantly medially which when correlated with an outside CT of ___ likely correspond to areas of fibrosis with associated bronchiectasis. An underlying mass cannot be entirely excluded. There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle which suggests either chronic pleural thickening or small effusion. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal limits given patient's rotation on the current study.
