A portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph excludes the lung apices. All lobes remain aerated, with some left retrocardiac consolidation persisting. The tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump projects slightly higher than seen on the study from an hour and a half earlier, now approximately 4.5 cm below the aortic arch. Swan-Ganz catheter tip extending from right internal jugular vein is directed towards the right main pulmonary outflow tract. The tip of the nasogastric tube is only just below the gastroesophageal junction and could be advanced. Chest tubes appear in unchanged position. The tip of what appears to be an endotracheal tube is just included in the view of the film and also appears unchanged compared to the earlier study.
