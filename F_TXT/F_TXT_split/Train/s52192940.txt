As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, potentially as an expression of improved ventilation. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung basis and platelike atelectasis of the left lung bases, however, persist. Currently there is no evidence for pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
