A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained. A right-sided PICC line tip remains in the right atrium. The lungs are clear. Hila are mildly indistinct which may suggest mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac contour is mildly enlarged. Median sternotomy wires are intact. No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.
