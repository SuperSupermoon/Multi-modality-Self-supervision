Recommend advancing several centimeters to secure access. No other enteric catheter or central venous line identified. Electronic pack projects over the right upper chest with leads coursing upward, possibly a deep brain stimulator. Minimal atelectatic changes are noted in the lung bases, left greater than right. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion identified.
