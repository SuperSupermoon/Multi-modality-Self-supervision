Interval placement of Dobbhoff feeding tube which has its tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach. The right internal jugular central catheter and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles likely reflects small effusions. Lungs are grossly clear. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
