Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates stable bibasilar atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the region of the pulmonary valve. A right-sided supraclavicular subclavian line is seen with the tip terminating in the distal SVC. A right internal jugular central venous line terminates at the origin of the right brachiocephalic vein. Nasogastric tube is seen with tip outside the borders of this image. Endotracheal tube is seen at the level of the thoracic inlet, but is more than 7 cm above the carina.
