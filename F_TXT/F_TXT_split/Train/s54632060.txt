AP chest compared to ___ and ___: Between ___ and ___, extensive right pleural thickening had developed. Fissural pleural effusion decreased, but there is still substantial atelectasis in the right lung on ___. Subsequently, a region of consolidation has developed in the right mid lung, probably pneumonia, and there is ground-glass opacification of the left apex. Whether this is asymmetric pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage or recent aspiration is radiographically indeterminate. Left lower lung is the only lung region that is relatively normal. Heart size is larger today than in ___, but some of the apparent change is due to mediastinal shift by the increasing right pleural effusion. Mediastinal widening in the right lower paratracheal station is instead due to pleural tumor.
