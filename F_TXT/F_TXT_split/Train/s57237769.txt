When compared to prior, there has been interval progression of diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities most confluent in the left upper lung and right mid lung. There is no large pleural effusion. There is prominence of the mediastinum on the right including leftward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet. Hila are not well assessed on the current study due to parenchymal opacities but are known to have bilateral enlarged lymph nodes by prior CT. No acute osseous abnormalities.
