No previous images. Obliquity of the patient and respiratory motion somewhat obscures the image. The endotracheal tube appears to be about 3.5 cm above the carina. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with engorged and ill-defined pulmonary vessels consistent with some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Probable atelectatic changes at both bases.
