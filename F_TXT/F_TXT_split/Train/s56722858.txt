Comparison is made to previous study from six hours earlier. There is again seen a moderate sized pneumothorax in the right, which appears stable. There are chest tubes in the right apex and right base, unchanged in position. There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral chest wall. There is a tortuous thoracic aorta. There is a vague opacity in the left base, which may represent developing infiltrate, aspiration or atelectasis.
