AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. An NG tube is seen to pass through the esophagus and reaching well into the stomach area. However, the line is folded up and reverses so that the tip is located still in the lower esophagus. Adjustment of tube position preferentially under fluoroscopic control is recommended. In the abdominal area, rather marked gas distended large bowel loops are identified. This speaks against the clinical assumption of small-bowel obstruction. No acute pulmonary infiltrates are seen, and short of a thin plate atelectasis on the left base.
