Single AP view of the chest provided. Surgical hardware is unchanged. 2 left chest tubes end in the left lung apex, unchanged from prior. The left pigtail catheter coils in the left upper quadrant. A minimal amount of subcutaneous emphysema along the left chest wall is unchanged. Tiny, residual pneumothorax at the left lung apex is significantly improved. A moderate right pleural effusion is mildly worsened. A left small pleural effusion appears mildly improved. An opacity along the left lateral chest wall, likely represents surgical changes following pleurodesis and is significantly improved. Predominately bibasilar alveolar and interstitial opacities in the setting of moderate cardiomegaly and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature likely represents improved mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.
