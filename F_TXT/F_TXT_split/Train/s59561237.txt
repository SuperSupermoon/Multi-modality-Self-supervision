AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study dated ___. The long semi-metallic wide- caliber tracheostomy cannula is again identified. Apparently its external portion has now been flipped over to the patient's left side. The more central portion of the tube is overlying trachea on the frontal view still pointing somewhat to the left wall of the trachea, but not penetrating it. There is no evidence of pneumothorax and no new pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are identified. A previously described Dobbhoff line remains in place, reaching into the stomach.
