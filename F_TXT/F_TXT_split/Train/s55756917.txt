AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are appreciably lower. Increase in opacification in the left lung is attributable to very mild edema, but on the right the change is more pronounced with a more nodular component which suggests developing aspiration pneumonia. The endotracheal tube ends above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 7 cm from the carina and it should be advanced 2-3 cm for more secured seating. Nasogastric tube is coiled in the stomach. The heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone at 11:02 a.m., one minute following the recognition of the radiologic findings.
