Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Left basilar opacity likely representing a small pleural effusion and atelectasis has increased. Allowing for technique, pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. There is no right effusion. No pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
