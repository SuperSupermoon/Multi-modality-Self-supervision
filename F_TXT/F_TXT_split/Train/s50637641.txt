Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged, unchanged. The aorta remains tortuous with mild atherosclerotic calcifications. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Minimal patchy opacity within the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Left apical scarring is similar. At Mild S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is re- demonstrated.
