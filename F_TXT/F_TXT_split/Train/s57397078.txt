Mild bibasilar opacification is likely secondary to atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusion is noted. There is likely some associated basilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Cardiac silhouette is within normal size. No intraperitoneal free air is identified underneath the diaphragm. Dilated bowel loops are noted. Incidental note is made of the right posterior lateral sixth rib minimally displaced fracture which appears new from prior exam. Remodeling of left proximal humerus compatible with an old fracture.
