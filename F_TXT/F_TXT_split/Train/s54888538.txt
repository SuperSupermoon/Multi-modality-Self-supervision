The patient is status post TAVR. The mediastinum is wide, however this could be due to low lung volumes and/or magnification artifact. Right mid lung opacity is seen, which could represent atelectasis or aspiration. There is suggestion of bilateral apical normal pneumothoraces. Right IJ device with pacemaker lead is seen extending and crossing midline.
