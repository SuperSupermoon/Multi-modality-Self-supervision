AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. On the present frontal view, heart size is normal. The thoracic aorta is moderately widened and markedly elongated with some calcium deposits in the wall at the level of the arch. No local contour abnormalities are identified. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested, but demonstrates a markedly asymmetric distribution pattern with areas of hypertranslucency and other areas of linear interstitial scarrings. There is no evidence of any acute discrete parenchymal infiltrate of pneumonic appearance. Low positioned and flattened diaphragms are indicative of rather advanced COPD with emphysema. No pneumothorax can be identified.
