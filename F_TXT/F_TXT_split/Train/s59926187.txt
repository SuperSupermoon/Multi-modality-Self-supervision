Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Overlying soft tissue partially obscures the left lung base and there are slightly low lung volumes. Given the above, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged, but may be accentuated by AP technique. The mediastinum and hilar contours are unremarkable.
