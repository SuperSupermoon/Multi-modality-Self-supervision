Cardiac silhouette size is at least moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous, and potentially dilated. There may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Lung volumes are low. Bibasilar airspace opacities with moderate size bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated, likely reflective of compressive atelectasis though infection or aspiration is not excluded. A peripheral wedge-shaped opacity in the left upper lung field may reflect an area of infarction. No large pneumothorax is detected though assessment is limited as the patient's neck and chin project over the left apex. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized. Degenerative changes are seen involving both shoulders and within the imaged thoracic spine.
