Since the chest radiograph obtained 2 days prior, multifocal parenchymal opacities have increased in extent and severity, most notably at the right lung base and mid left lung, which may reflect mildly increased pulmonary edema. A tracheostomy tube terminates approximately 6 cm above the carina with an overinflated cuff. A right-sided IJ tunneled catheter terminates in the right atrium approximately 2 cm inferior to the superior cavoatrial junction. A left-sided IJ central venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC at its junction with the left brachiocephalic vein. Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes are unchanged.
