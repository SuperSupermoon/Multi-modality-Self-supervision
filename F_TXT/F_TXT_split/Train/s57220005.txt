Compared to the prior study, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Cardiomegaly and sternotomy wires again noted. Known AVR is only faintly visualized. There is hazy opacity at both lung bases, compatible layering effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. The degree of pleural fluid appears slightly greater bilaterally, compared with ___ at 17:05. There is upper zone redistribution and slight vascular plethora, without other evidence of CHF.
