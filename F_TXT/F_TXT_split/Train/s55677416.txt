Left pigtail pleural catheter has apparently slightly changed in position, and there has been a slight decrease in the size of a small left pleural effusion, but no pneumothorax is visible. With the exception of decreasing left pleural effusion and adjacent left basilar opacity, there is otherwise no relevant short interval change since the previous study of one day earlier.
