Tracheostomy tube is noted in standard position. A left IJ catheter tip projects at the cavoatrial junction. Portions of the base of the left lung are not included in the field of view. Within this limitation, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is no evidence of large pneumothorax. The right lower lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis is stable. Minimal perihilar and left lower lobe opacities appear stable. Bilateral rib fractures are again noted.
