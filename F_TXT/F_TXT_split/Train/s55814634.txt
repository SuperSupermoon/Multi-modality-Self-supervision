A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right internal jugular catheter terminating in the mid SVC. The patient has been extubated. Lung volumes remain low with exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Even allowing for this, the heart is enlarged. There is persistent mild pulmonary edema, minimally improved compared to the day prior. Bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right, are unchanged. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is appreciated.
