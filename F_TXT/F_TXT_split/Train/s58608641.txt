The ET tube and right IJ line are unchanged. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution with perihilar haze and bilateral alveolar infiltrates, compatible with fluid overload. There are small pleural effusions. Compared to the prior study, the alveolar infiltrates are slightly worse. Right upper quadrant clips are again seen.
