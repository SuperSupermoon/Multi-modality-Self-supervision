Since the radiograph from 3 hr prior, there is no relevant change. No pulmonary edema or pneumonia. No pneumothorax. Left pleural effusion is slightly smaller. Right pleural effusion is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. This examination neither suggests nor excludes the possibility of pulmonary embolus.
