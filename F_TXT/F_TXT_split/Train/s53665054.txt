An ET tube is present, terminating 2.5 cm above the carinal, in appropriate position. The enteric tube has been removed. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs are well expanded. Diffuse haziness projecting over the entire left lung is noted, which may be due in part to overlying support devices. Gaseous distension of the stomach is noted. The visualized osseous structures are within normal limits.
