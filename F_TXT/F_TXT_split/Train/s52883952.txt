AP chest compared to ___ and ___: Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved, most evident in the left lung. Small right pleural effusion is larger. Opacification at the base of the right lung could be the residual of edema and atelectasis, but there is a heterogeneous quality to it that raises concern for pneumonia. Heart size is normal. This is confirmed in the right upper lobe on the chest CTA performed nearly concurrently. The small lung nodules seen on that study are barely visible on this conventional bedside radiograph.
