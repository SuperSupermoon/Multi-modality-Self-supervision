In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed. Continued low lung volumes with some element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Multiple streaks of atelectasis are seen at the right and there is left basilar opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and effusion. Probable small right effusion as well. In the right mid zone, there is a vague suggestion of some possible coalescent opacification. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent supervening pneumonia.
