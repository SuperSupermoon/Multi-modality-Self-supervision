The ET tube ends 3 cm above the carina. Tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter remains in the proximal right pulmonary artery. Right PICC line ends in the mid SVC. NG tube passes into the stomach and out of view. A left pacemaker with leads in the expected position of the right atrium and right ventricle is unchanged. Compared with most recent prior radiograph, lung volumes are lower and as a consequence, there is a general increase in lung density. In addition, there has been decrease in left upper lung opacity with increase in left lower lung opacity, which given the time course likely represents redistribution of pulmonary edema. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. No pneumothorax is present.
