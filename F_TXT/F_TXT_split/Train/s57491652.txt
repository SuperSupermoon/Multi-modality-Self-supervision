Tip of right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged and there remains widening of the vascular pedicle accompanied by pulmonary vascular engorgement and slight improvement in perihilar edema since the recent radiograph. Recently described left retrocardiac opacity has also slightly improved. Bilateral pleural effusions are not appreciably changed allowing for positional differences of the patient.
