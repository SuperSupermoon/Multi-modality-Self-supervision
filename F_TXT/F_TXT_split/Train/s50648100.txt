Portable semi-upright radiograph is obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and appears to be curled within the fundus. Multiple right upper quadrant clips are seen. Bilateral central venous catheters are unchanged in satisfactory position. Diffuse bilateral opacities are slightly improved without definite effusions. Mild cardiomegaly persists along with mediastinal vascular engorgement. No pneumothorax is seen.
