1. New large left middle and lower lung zone opacity, most consistent with pneumonia. A component of pleural fluid is difficult to completely exclude. Recommend follow-up to resolution to exclude an underlyingmass. 2. Smaller opacity at the right base may represent atelectasis or second focus of pneumonia. 3. Apparent widening of the mediastinum may be related to the AP technique and patient rotation. Recommend a repeat PA and lateral radiograph when the patient is more clinically stable, if high clinical concern for acute mediastinal/aortic process, CT is more sensitive.
