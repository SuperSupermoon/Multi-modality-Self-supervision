A single portable frontal view of the chest was performed. An overlying trauma board limits complete evaluation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. There is no displaced rib fracture appreciated. A minimal dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is likely positional and unrelated to trauma. There is no paraspinal hematoma appreciated. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
