Lung volumes are greater and there has been some apparent clearing in widespread pulmonary consolidation and nodulation. This could indeed be due to real improvement, or alternatively just better aeration due to more positive pressure support. The nodulation suggests widespread infection, perhaps due to aspiration, which may have been a cause of noncardiogenic edema. Heart is normal size. Pleural effusions if present are probably not large. ET tube is in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view, a left trans jugular Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the main pulmonary artery, right internal jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax.
