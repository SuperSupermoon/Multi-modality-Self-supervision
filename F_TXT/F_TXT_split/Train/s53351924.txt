Comparison is made to prior study from two hours earlier. The distal tip of the feeding tube is in the lower esophagus and could be advanced ___-15 cm for more optimal placement. There is no longer a loop seen within the catheter. There is a right IJ central line with distal lead tip in the distal SVC. The heart size is upper limits of normal. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema or focal consolidation.
