Vascular clips denotes prior midline thoracic surgery, presumably mediastinal. The roughly 12 cm spherical soft tissue abnormality projects to the left to the midline lower chest. Given the course of vascular clips I suspect this is a gastric pull up, but it could be an aortic aneurysm or even a recurrent mass. Unfortunately we have no prior radiographic studies to clarify the history, Lungs are fully expanded and clear. There is no pleural abnormality. Right jugular line loops in the right neck and terminates at the origin of the SVC. Heart is normal size. The other mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
