An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 5 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of field of view. Since the prior exam, there is a new opacity at the right base with volume loss and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, most consistent with new right lower lobe collapse. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
