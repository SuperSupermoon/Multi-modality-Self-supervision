There remains marked widening of the left upper and mid mediastinum at the level of the aortic arch, corresponding to the site of the patient's reported descending aortic replacement procedure. The width of approximately 11 cm is similar to the recent study of one day earlier. Left-sided chest tubes have been removed since the prior radiographs, with development of small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and a small basilar lateral pneumothorax. Increasing homogeneous opacity in the right lower hemithorax is probably a combination of pleural fluid and adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation.
