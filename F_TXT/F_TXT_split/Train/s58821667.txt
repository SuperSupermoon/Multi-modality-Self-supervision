Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There has been worsening of the left retrocardiac opacity since the previous study. There are diffuse airspace opacities. Multifocal pneumonia versus overt pulmonary edema are likely both present. There is also likely a right-sided pleural effusion. Increase density at the left apex is likely due to overlying external object.
