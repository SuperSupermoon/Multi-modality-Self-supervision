There has been interval placement of the right chest tube which terminates near the apex. A small right pneumothorax is demonstrated. There is a large right pleural effusion which is partially loculated laterally. Right basilar opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis. There is no mediastinal shift. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Left lung is essentially clear aside from minimal atelectasis at the left base. No acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.
