In comparison with the study of ___, the right chest tube has been removed and there is little change in the degree of apical pneumothorax. Postoperative changes are again seen in the right hemithorax with retraction of the upper trachea at to that side. The large bullet in the superior segment of the left lower lobe with associated bronchiectasis and bronchial plugging was much better identified on the CT study of ___. There is an area of increased opacification in the left mid zone at the level of the hilum. This could possibly reflect a developing consolidation.
