Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely borderline enlarged. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is noted. Mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable. There is no focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
