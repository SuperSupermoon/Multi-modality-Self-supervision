AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are dual-lead left-sided pacer device with lead extending in the expected position of the right atrium and right ventricle. Midline tracheostomy is seen. There is a right subclavian central venous catheter, distal aspect not well appreciated due to the overlapping structures, but likely terminating at the cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium. What appears to be a weighted enteric tube is seen coursing into the left upper quadrant in the expected location of the proximal stomach. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. There are small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen. Subtle haziness of the left mid lung zone may relate to layering pleural effusion. However, ground-glass opacity, with subtle infectious process is not excluded. There appears to be a left-sided PICC, distal aspect not well seen, but likely terminating in the proximal SVC.
