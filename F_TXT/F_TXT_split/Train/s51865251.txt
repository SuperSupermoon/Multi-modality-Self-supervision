Right subclavian PICC line, VP shunt, endotracheal tube, and feeding tube are unchanged in position. The heart remains markedly enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Lung volumes are low with layering bilateral effusions and patchy bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No obvious pneumothorax. An IVC filter is incompletely visualized.
