AP chest compared to ___ at 5:09 a.m.: An enteric tube follows a course similar to the enteric tube in place yesterday, ending in the left upper quadrant, presumably but not definitively in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax. Left PIC line ends low in the SVC. Moderate cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions have increased. Atelectasis at both lung bases is stable.
