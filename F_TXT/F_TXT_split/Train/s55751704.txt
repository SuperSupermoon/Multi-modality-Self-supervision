A right basilar pigtail pleural catheter remains in place. There is a questionable tiny lucency near the right apex which could reflect a very tiny pneumothorax or possibly loculated air or focal pleural fat as no definite pleural line is seen extending from this lucency. Clinical correlation is recommended. Residual patchy opacity at the right base likely reflects atelectasis. Improved aeration at the left base. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient rotation.
