Lung volumes are slightly low. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There has been interval improvement in pulmonary edema, likely with mild residual pulmonary vascular congestion. Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged, probably representing relaxation atelectasis. Left pleural effusion is small, possibly minimally larger. New since the prior exam is a new small right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
