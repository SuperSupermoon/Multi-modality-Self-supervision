Left-sided pigtail chest tube is again visualized projecting over the left mid chest. There is a large left pneumothorax that is increased in size compared to prior. There is a large amount of left-sided subcutaneous emphysema which has also increased in size. This is a rotated film and therefore it is difficult to assess for mediastinal shift. The ET tube, NG tube and left subclavian line are unchanged. There compressive changes in the right lung and it is difficult to assess for alveolar infiltrate due to the patient positioning and volume loss. There is a small right effusion.
