Compared to the prior radiograph, the moderate right pleural effusion has decreased, now small in size. The new pleural catheter tip crosses the midline, likely positioned against the mediastinal wall. No evidence of pneumothorax or focal consolidation. Minimal left pleural effusion is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly persists, with persistent vascular engorgement and slightly worsened edema. The tortuous, calcified thoracic aorta and mitral annular calcifications are unchanged.
