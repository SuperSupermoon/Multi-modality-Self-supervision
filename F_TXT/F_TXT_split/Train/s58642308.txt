In comparison to ___ radiograph, extensive intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and postobstructive collapse of the left upper lobe are persistent findings, more fully evaluated by recent CTA of the chest. Widespread pulmonary nodules have also been more fully evaluated by that study. A worsening focus of consolidation is present in the right middle lobe, and could potentially represent an evolving focus of pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Atelectasis at the left base with adjacent elevation of left hemidiaphragm are unchanged.
