As compared to the previous radiograph, coiling of the Dobbhoff catheter in the lower parts of the esophagus has been resolved. The course of the Dobbhoff catheter is now unremarkable. However, the catheter is positioned too proximal, with the tip approximately at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. The catheter should be advanced by approximately 5-10 cm. No other relevant changes, no evidence of complications. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
