There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 1.1 cm above the level of the carina. Recommend withdrawal by approximately 2-3 cm. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the stomach. There is severe pulmonary edema/ARDS; this has significantly worsened as compared to earlier the same date, ___ at 15:29. There is also more confluent opacity at the lateral right upper lung, which could be due to layering fluid or underlying consolidation. The left aortic border at the level of the aortic arch is difficult to assess due to the adjacent perihilar opacity. Superimposed infection is not excluded.
