AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Relatively high positioned diaphragms indicate poor inspirational effort or may be related to abdominal distention. The pulmonary vasculature appears crowded and there is a moderate degree of perivascular haze mostly in the lung bases, suggestive of some congestion. Acute discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates cannot be identified and the lateral pleural sinuses are free from any major pleural effusion. The heart appears to be enlarged, but is difficult to identify detail. Prominent calcium deposits; however, are seen in the mitral ring area. Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for comparison.
