Right-sided IJ central venous catheter sheath is seen, with the tip in the superior portion of the SVC. A right-sided drainage catheter is seen, perhaps a mediastinal drain vs chest tube. A left-sided chest tube or mediastinal drain is also seen. The patient has been extubated in the interval. No pneumothorax. A curvilinear radiopacity projecting over the left side of the heart is of uncertain significance, perhaps outside of the patient, but should be correlated clinically. It is in a slightly different location than on the prior radiograph. Pulmonary vascular markings are slightly more prominent than on the prior examination, perhaps indicating slight pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacity likely relates to atelectasis.
