Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance, unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities are re- demonstrated in the lung bases, potentially atelectasis though aspiration cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified. Sub acute left-sided rib fractures are again.
