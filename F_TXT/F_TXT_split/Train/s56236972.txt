There has been interval placement of a pigtail right chest tube, projecting over the inferolateral right chest, with overlap of the pigtail with the distal catheter, raising potential concern for kink. Correlate clinically for drainage. There is slight decrease in overall size of the right pleural effusion with minimal residual aeration of the right upper lobe. No pneumothorax. Suture in the left lung again noted.
