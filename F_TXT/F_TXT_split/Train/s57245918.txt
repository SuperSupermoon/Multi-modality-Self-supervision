AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiographs, ___: Left subclavian infusion port ends in the upper SVC. Heart is top normal size. Lung volumes are low and there is extensive heterogeneous opacification at both lung bases. Although the azygos vein is mildly dilated, the upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is not and therefore even though the patient has emphysema which would distort the distribution of edema, pneumonia should be the leading diagnostic possibility. Torso CT on ___ showed abundant tracheal secretions and relatively minor atelectasis or aspiration or post-pneumonia changes at the right base. Although today's study suggests a centimeter size nodule in the right upper lobe at the level of the second anterior interspace, there was no soft tissue lung nodule on ___. Given the presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, it is possible that a pulmonary metastasis could have grown to this size in the interim. Dr. ___ was paged at 9:15 a.m., 1 minute after the findings were recognized and we discussed the case at 9:20am.
