As compared to the previous radiograph, the clips at the right lung apex and the combined mediastinal parenchymal opacities are unchanged. These are likely results of prior surgery. The remaining right lung and the entire left lung are otherwise unchanged. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia. The heart continues to be moderately enlarged. Larger pleural effusions are not seen.
