Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is stable. Moderate to large bilateral effusions larger on the left are unchanged, allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Improving opacities in the left mid hemi thorax are due to markedly improved aeration / prior large atelectasis. There are still atelectasis in the left base. Atelectasis in the right base have minimally improved. Moderate pulmonary edema is grossly unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Aortic stent is in place.
