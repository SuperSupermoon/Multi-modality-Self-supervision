In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been a left thoracentesis with removal of a moderate amount of effusion and no evidence of post procedure pneumothorax. There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour. Streaks of atelectasis with possible re-expansion edema above it. Otherwise little change.
