As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube and the right internal jugular vein catheter have been removed. The left PICC line appears to be malpositioned in the azygos vein and needs to be repositioned. The nasogastric tube shows an unchanged normal course. The lung volumes have slightly decreased. There is evidence of mild to moderate pulmonary edema as well as a right upper lobe opacity suggesting pneumonia. No larger pleural effusions. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
