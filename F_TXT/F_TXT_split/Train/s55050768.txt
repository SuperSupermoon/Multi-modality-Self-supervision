AP chest compared to ___: Patient is rightward shifted which projects the large heart over the right lower lung, but nevertheless, there is clearly progressive opacification of the right lung and decrease in volume of the right hemithorax suggesting a large component of atelectasis, conceivably obscuring pneumonia, but not necessarily. Left lung is grossly clear. As before, the endotracheal tube is too high, 2 cm above the upper margin of the clavicles and no less than 6 cm above the carina. It should be advanced at least 3 cm for more secured seating and improved aeration. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. At least a small right pleural effusion, new or increased since ___, is presumed. Nasogastric tube is looped in the stomach. Right PIC line ends at the junction of brachiocephalic veins. A new lead runs parallel to the left clavicle ending in the midline, but I do not recognize it. Clinical correlation is needed. There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged.
