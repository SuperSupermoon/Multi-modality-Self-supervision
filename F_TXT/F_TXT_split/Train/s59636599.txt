There is a large, somewhat rounded, area of focal opacity in the lateral portion of the right upper lobe, abutting the minor fissure, with equivocal associated air bronchograms. Possible minimal atelectasis at the right base. Otherwise, no focal infiltrates or consolidations are identified. No CHF or effusion. No pneumothorax detected. There is mild cardiomegaly. Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected. The current radiograph suggests mild right convex curvature of the thoracic spine centered at T4/5 --___ thoracic spine curvature was probably subtly present on ___.
