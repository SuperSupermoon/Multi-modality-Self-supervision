Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits for technique. There is limited evaluation of the left retrocardiac region due to a combination of apical lordotic projection and cardiomegaly. With this limitation in mind, no focal areas of consolidation are present within the lungs. However, standard PA and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful for more complete evaluation of the left lower lobe when the patient's condition permits.
