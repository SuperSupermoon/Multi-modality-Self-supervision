As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular vein introduction sheath has been removed. The pre-existing parenchymal opacity at the left lung base is almost completely resolved. However, new parenchymal opacities seen on the left in the perihilar lung areas. The opacity has a sharp border and is therefore likely to be limited by a fissural structure. No larger pleural effusions. Unchanged enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, moderate fluid overload is present, as manifested by increased vascular diameters. No other signs suggestive of pulmonary edema.
