Portable AP chest radiograph. The patient has been extubated in the interim and the NGT removed. Left-sided subclavian catheter tip is in stable position. The left lower lobe is chronically consolidated, presumably atelectatic (the mediastinum is anatomically located to the left). Right lower lung atelectasis is slightly improved. Mild interstitial edema and moderate cardiomegaly are also unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
