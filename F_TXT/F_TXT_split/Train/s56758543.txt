Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. A right internal jugular introducer catheter remains in place. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy for CABG. There are persistent but improving opacities at both apices and involving the left upper and mid lung. These findings may represent resolving aspiration or pulmonary hemorrhage related to recent cardiac arrest or resolving pulmonary edema in an atypical distribution. Clinical correlation is advised. No large effusions. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
