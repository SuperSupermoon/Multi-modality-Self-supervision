In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the orogastric tube is extremely difficult to identify. It extends at least into the pyloric region where it takes a downward curve at the level of the iliac crest on the right. Endotracheal tube remains in good position. Bilateral pulmonary opacifications are again consistent with substantial layering effusions, compressive atelectasis at the bases, and elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
