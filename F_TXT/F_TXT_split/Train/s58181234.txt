The ET tube and NG tube have been removed. The right IJ catheter with tip in the mid SVC is again seen. Again seen are diffuse alveolar infiltrates compatible with pulmonary edema/ARDS. While there has been some partial clearing in the right mid lung, the remainder of the appearance of the lungs is unchanged. Some of this may be due to ARDS and some of it may be due to pulmonary edema.
