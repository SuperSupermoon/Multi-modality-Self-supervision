Single portable supine frontal image of the chest. The ET tube is in adequate position. The OG tube passes into the stomach and off of the image inferiorly. The lungs are well expanded. Mild pulmonary edema is seen. Opacities are seen in the bilateral lung bases, which may represent atelectasis, but cannot excluded pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting. The left costophrenic angle is not included on this exam, but there are bilateral small pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is very enlarged.
