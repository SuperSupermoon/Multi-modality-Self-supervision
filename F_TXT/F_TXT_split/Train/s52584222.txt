The endotracheal tube ends 3.4 cm above the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip in the left upper quadrant likely in the proximal stomach. Evaluation of the chest is slightly limited due to patient rotation to the right. The lung volumes are low with resultant bronchovascular crowding and accentuation of cardiomediastinal silhouette. Retrocardiac opacification most likely reflects atelectasis. There is no pulmonary edema, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The thoracic aorta is unfolded.
