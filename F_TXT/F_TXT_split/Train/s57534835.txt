There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube that ends approximately 5 cm above the carinal. A right-sided PICC line ends in the lower SVC in unchanged position. There has been no significant interval change in appearance of the lungs compared with the previous exam, with a diffuse alveolar process that appears to have the same distribution observed in prior CT from ___. The more pronouced right basal opacity is likely a combination of atelectasis and a large layering pleural effusion. A small left-sided pleural effusion with probable associated atelectasis is also present.
