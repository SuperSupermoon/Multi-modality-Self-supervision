As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube and the right central venous access line persist. The left lung is substantially better ventilated with only a small area of atelectasis remaining in the retrocardiac lung areas. On the right, the lung volumes have also increased and a small pre-existing medial basal atelectasis persists. No pneumothorax. No larger pleural effusions. No new parenchymal opacity. Moderate cardiomegaly, with enlargement of the left ventricle, is unchanged.
