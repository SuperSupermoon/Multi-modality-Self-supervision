In comparison with the study of ___, there are again low lung volumes. Opacification at the right base is consistent with pleural fluid and underlying compressive atelectasis. The left lung is essentially clear. Mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure persists. Of incidental note is a VP shunt projecting over the right hemithorax.
