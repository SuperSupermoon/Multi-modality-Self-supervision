As compared to the previous radiograph, there has been selective intubation of the left lung. There are areas of minimally increased parenchymal opacity on the left, likely suggesting aspiration or mild pulmonary edema. The right lung is subtotally collapsed with homogeneous opacification of the right hemithorax. There is no large right malignancy. The precise size of the cardiac silhouette cannot be determined.
