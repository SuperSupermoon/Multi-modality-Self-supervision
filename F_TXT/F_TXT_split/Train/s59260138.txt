AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging: Patient is rotated to the left, which should increase the relative opacity of the right hemithorax. Instead, there is greater density on the left, which in the presence of elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is presumably atelectasis. Followup suggested to exclude effect of aspiration. Right lung is clear. The heart size is normal, and there is no appreciable pleural abnormality.
