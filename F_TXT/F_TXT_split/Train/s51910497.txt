In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with double-lumen catheter in place. Continued low lung volumes. Mild engorgement of pulmonary vessels is consistent with overhydration. The left hemidiaphragm is better seen than on the previous study, though there are still some atelectatic changes in the retrocardiac region.
