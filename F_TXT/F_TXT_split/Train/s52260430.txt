Heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with continued elevation of the left hilus. Prominence of the hila bilaterally reflects the previously demonstrated soft tissue which encases the hilar regions and tracts along the lower lobe airways, as seen on the recent CT. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Small left pleural effusion may be slightly increased in size compared to the previous study. Atelectasis is seen in the left lung base. Aeration in the right base is improved with decreased extent of the previously noted patchy right basilar opacity. No new focal consolidation is present. There is no pneumothorax.
