AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, presumably edema with either exacerbation in the upper lobes or concurrent pneumonia has not changed appreciably. Pleural effusion is small if any. Heart is top normal size. As noted previously, the cuff of the tracheostomy tube is inflated beyond the diameter of the normal trachea. This is either distending the trachea or lies anterior to it. Clinical correlation advised. Left PIC line ends low in the SVC. Small pleural effusions are presumed but there is no pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged.
