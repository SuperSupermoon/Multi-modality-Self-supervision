The endotracheal tube tip sits just beneath the level of clavicular heads, which is new from prior study. The heart size is large, but stable to prior exam. The mediastinal contours demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob. A large calcified lymph node projects just right of midline. The interstitial markings of the lungs show minimally increased prominence as well as prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, compatible with mildly increased interstitial edema. There is no pneumothorax. No displaced rib fracture is apparent.
