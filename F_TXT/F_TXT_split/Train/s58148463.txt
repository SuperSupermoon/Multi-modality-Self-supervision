Low lung volumes are present. New moderate-to-large left pleural effusion is noted which obscures the cardiac silhouette thereby making assessment of the heart size difficult. Additionally, there is left basilar opacification which may reflect compressive atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded. There is likely mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. No pneumothorax or right-sided pleural effusion is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
