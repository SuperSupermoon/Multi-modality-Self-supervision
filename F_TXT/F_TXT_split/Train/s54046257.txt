Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Lungs are clear except for linear focus of atelectasis or scar at the left lung base. Please note that if a pulmonary AVM is suspected clinically, dedicated chest CTA would be suggested as it is much more sensitive than portable radiographs for detecting pulmonary AVMs.
