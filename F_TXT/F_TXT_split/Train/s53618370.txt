Interval placement of an endotracheal tube with the tip projecting approximately 4.6 cm above the level the carina. Lung volumes remain low with crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Slight increase in the degree of bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration is difficult to exclude. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess given the low lung volumes, but grossly unchanged.
