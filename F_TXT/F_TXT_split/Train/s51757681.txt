There is a single-lead pacemaker device terminating in the right ventricle. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The lungs appear clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no definite bony abnormality. A pacemaker partly obscures the course of the lateral and anterior left third rib and this study does not constitute a complete rib series.
