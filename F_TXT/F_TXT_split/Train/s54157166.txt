Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen, coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. There are relatively low lung volumes. Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature may relate to low lung volumes, although there may be a component of underlying edema and aspiration. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. The mediastinum appear widened, which may be due to supine, AP portable technique, although if there is clinical concern for acute aortic injury, chest CTA would be recommended.
