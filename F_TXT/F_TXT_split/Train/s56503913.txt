Comparison is made to the prior chest radiograph performed six hours earlier, as well as the chest CT. There has been worsening of the area of consolidation with air-fluid levels within the right upper lobe. This is consistent with suspected empyema following right upper lobe resection. There has been placement of endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 7 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. The side port of nasogastric tube is above the gastroesophageal junction and this could be advanced 5-10 cm for optimal placement. The right lung is relatively clear.
