Because the patient is not properly positioned, I cannot assess the severity of leftward mediastinal shift . This is important because there is new consolidation in the left lower lobe and if there is appreciable leftward mediastinal shift and some or all of the consolidation is due to collapse. If there is minimal or no shift, it is more likely pneumonia. There is new mild atelectasis at the right base as well as small bilateral pleural effusions. Heart size is normal. Upper lungs are clear. ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements. A shunt catheter traverses the right neck chest and upper abdomen. Nasogastric drainage tube is looped in the nondistended stomach. There is no pneumothorax.
