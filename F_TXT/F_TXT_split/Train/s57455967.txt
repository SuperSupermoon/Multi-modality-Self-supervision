AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, ___: Pulmonary vascular re-distribution and small bilateral pleural effusions have increased. Opacification in the right lower lobe could be atelectasis alone or consolidation. There is no pulmonary edema in the upper lungs. Heart is moderately enlarged, and pulmonary arteries somewhat dilated, which can reflect elevated left atrial pressure, even in the absence of pulmonary edema.
