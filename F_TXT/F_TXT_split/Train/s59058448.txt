Right internal jugular central line, nasogastric tube, endotracheal tube and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position. Right lung remains grossly clear. There is persistent retrocardiac consolidation with associated effusion likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis. Superimposed pneumonia can not be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient positioning.
