A frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a nasoenteric to extending below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image, as well as a right approach pigtail catheter overlying the right upper quadrant, presumably within the hepatic abscess. A moderate right pleural effusion, which extends over the right lung apex, is decreased compared to the prior chest radiograph. No obvious focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.
