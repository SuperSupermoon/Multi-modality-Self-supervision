Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen. Additional right base patchy opacity is seen, which could relate to atelectasis, although underlying infection or aspiration may be present. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The mediastinum is unremarkable. Hilar contours are stable.
