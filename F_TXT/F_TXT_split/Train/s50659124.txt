Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates an enteric tube in hairpin loop configuration with tip directed upwards at the level of the carina, compatible with malpositioning. The cardiac silhouette is mildly prominent, likely accentuated by AP technique. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aortic arch. The lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. An apparent concavity along the superolateral aspect of the right humeral head may represent a Hill-___ deformity due to prior injury.
