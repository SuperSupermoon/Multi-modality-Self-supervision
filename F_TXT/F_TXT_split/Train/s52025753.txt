There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The bilateral lungs and cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged in appearance compared with the prior study with bilateral opacifications suspicious for pneumonia or aspiration. There has also been interval repositioning of the endotracheal tube, which is now in appropriate position, terminating 4.3 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube has also been repositioned since the prior study, coursing below the diaphragm with side hole below the level of the diaphragm, but near the gastroesophageal junction, and could be advanced several cm.
