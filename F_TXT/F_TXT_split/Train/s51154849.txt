Interval removal of left subclavian catheter with no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Interval improved aeration in right lung base, likely due to improved atelectasis involving the right middle and right lower lobes. Residual opacity with air bronchograms could potentially represent pneumonia or atelectasis. Left lower lobe atelectasis and adjacent small-to-moderate pleural effusion are unchanged, but a small right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in the interval.
