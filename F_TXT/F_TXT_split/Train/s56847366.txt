There has been repositioning of the endotracheal tube, which now ends approximately 4 cm above the carina. An esophageal tube again is seen with both the side port and tip below the gastroesophageal junction. Otherwise the lungs are well expanded and clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
