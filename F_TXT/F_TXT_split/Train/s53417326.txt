Single portable view of the chest. Extremely low lung volumes are noted. Endotracheal tube is within 1 cm of the carina and should be withdrawn. Enteric tube passes below the inferior field of view. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are identified. There is focal opacity at the left costophrenic angle, potentially atelectasis given low lung volumes, although infection would also be possible or potentially effusion.
