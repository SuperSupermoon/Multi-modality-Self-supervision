Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. The combination makes it difficult to exclude concurrent pneumonia. To make that determination would probably require CT scanning. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is stable. There is no visible pleural drainage device. Tracheostomy tube is midline. Feeding tube ends in the upper stomach. Right PIC line can be traced as far as the superior cavoatrial junction but is obscured beyond that point by the feeding tube and a dual channel right supraclavicular catheter which ends in the right atrium. There is no pneumothorax.
