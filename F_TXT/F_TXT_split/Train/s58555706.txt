Interval placement of a left basilar pigtail catheter with significant decrease in size of a loculated left basilar pleural effusion. There continues to be patchy airspace disease in the left mid and lower lungs, most likely representing compressive atelectasis, although a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. Patchy opacity at the right base may also represent an area of patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
