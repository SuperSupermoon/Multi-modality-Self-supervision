The endotracheal tube and feeding tube have been removed. Heart size is upper limits of normal. There is prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings without overt pulmonary edema or definite consolidation. This may be partially due to low lung volumes. There is atelectasis at the lung bases. No pneumothoraces are seen.
