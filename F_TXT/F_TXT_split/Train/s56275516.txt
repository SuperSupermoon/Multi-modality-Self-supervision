The patient is intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.8 cm above the carinal. The nasogastric tube is unchanged in course and position. Also unchanged is the course of the left internal jugular vein catheter. The pre described multifocal parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting pneumonia out or aspiration, are stable on the left and minimally increased on the right. Unchanged is the moderate cardiomegaly. Minimal increase in diameter of the perihilar vascular structures, likely reflecting mild fluid overload. No larger effusions are present.
