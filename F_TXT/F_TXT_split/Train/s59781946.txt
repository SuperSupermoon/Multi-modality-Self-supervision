Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. Midline sternotomy wires are again noted. There has been interval placement of a right arm PICC line with its tip located in the expected location of the superior vena cava. Lung volumes are markedly low which limits the evaluation. Additionally, the left CP angle is excluded. Allowing for these limitations, there is no focal consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax. Heart size could not be assessed. Mediastinal contour appears grossly stable though when compared with prior CT from ___ mediastinal widening likely reflects ectatic vasculature. Bony structures appear intact.
