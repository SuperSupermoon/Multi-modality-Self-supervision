Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomegaly is obscured by the pleuroparenchymal abnormalities. Large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is grossly unchanged allowing the difference in position of the patient. Extensive right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged. Lines and tubes and aortic stent are in standard position.
