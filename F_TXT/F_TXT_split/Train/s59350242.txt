Tip of endotracheal tube terminates approximately 8.5 cm above the carina and could be advanced several centimeters for standard positioning. Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for lower lung volumes. Patchy and linear areas of atelectasis have developed at the lung bases, right greater than left, as well as a possible small right pleural effusion. No visible pneumothorax, but external hardware and other devices overlie the right lung apex, limiting evaluation of this region. Attention to this area on repeat radiograph following removal or re-positioning of these devices would be helpful in this regard.
