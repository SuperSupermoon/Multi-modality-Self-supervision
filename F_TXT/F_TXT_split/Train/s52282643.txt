Supine frontal radiograph of the chest was reviewed. The heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Leftward shift of the heart with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is indicative of left lower lobe atelectasis. Interstitial prominence may be chronic or indicative of mild pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. Median sternotomy wires and CABG clips are noted. Prominence of the left first rib costosternal junction is noted.
