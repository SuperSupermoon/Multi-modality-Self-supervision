Compare to ___, lung volumes are low, accentuating the heart size and interstitial opacities. Bibasilar opacities obscuring the diaphragms are likely due to atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be excluded. Small left pleural effusion is likely. The mediastinum and the hilar contours are unremarkable. Left-sided VP shunt is seen.
