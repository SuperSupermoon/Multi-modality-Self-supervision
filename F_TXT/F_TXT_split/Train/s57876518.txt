Assessment is somewhat limited as the patient's chin and soft tissues of the neck obscure evaluation of the apices. Lung volumes are low. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Aortic knob is calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis, with no focal consolidation identified. No pleural effusion or large pneumothorax is seen. Old left-sided rib fractures are present.
