In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial increase in opacification at the right base with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm. Less prominent changes are seen on the left. The findings are consistent with a development of layering pleural effusions with underlying compressive atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right IJ catheter is been removed. The right Port-A-Cath through the subclavian approach remains in place.
