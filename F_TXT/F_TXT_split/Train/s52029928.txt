Rotated positioning. An NG tube is present -- the tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film. Compared with earlier the same day (16:46 p.m.), no gross change is identified. There is minimal patchy stranding at the right base medially and possible minimal retrocardiac atelectasis. No definite infiltrate is identified. No effusion is seen. No CHF. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent with a left ventricular configuration. The hila are also prominent with a tapered configuration, unchanged, which could reflect an element of pulmonary hypertension.
