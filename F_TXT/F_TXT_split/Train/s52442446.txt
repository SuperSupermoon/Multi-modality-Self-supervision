As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. Me mild areas of atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung region persist. Mild fluid overload persists but pulmonary edema is no longer present. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Unchanged position of the right internal jugular vein catheter. The suprahilar area on the right remains slightly enlarged, potentially caused by an elongated ascending aorta. The finding should receive attention on future followup radiographs.
