Compared to chest radiographs ___ and ___. New heterogeneous pulmonary abnormalities are very asymmetrically distributed. The perihilar left upper lobe component contains vascular congestion and increased background density, looking much like pulmonary edema. The right lower lobe component is more densely opacified shallow, shows some volume loss, and is accompanied by small right pleural effusion. I cannot ascribed this simply day asymmetric pulmonary edema. Instead I suggest consideration of edema in the setting of large pulmonary emboli or, alternatively, large scale aspiration. Heart is slightly larger but normal size. Incidental note is made of continues severe splenomegaly or other left upper quadrant mass effect.
