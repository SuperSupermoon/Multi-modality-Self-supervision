Mild pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions, and moderate cardiomegaly are little changed. The lung bases lobe better aerated, less likely to be pneumonia or even appreciable atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The transvenous right atrial lead is oriented more medially than usual. A lateral view would be helpful to determine that it is directed toward the anterior wall of the right atrium. Transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead is nearly at the cardiac apex.
