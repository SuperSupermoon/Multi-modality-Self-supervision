Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. ICD remains in place, unchanged in position. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and note is made of a calcified left ventricular aneurysm, also present on the prior radiograph. New pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by mild-to-moderate asymmetrical perihilar edema as well as a moderate right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent basilar opacities, which may reflect atelectasis or infectious consolidation.
