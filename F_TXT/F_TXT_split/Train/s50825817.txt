Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. New patchy opacities have developed in the right infrahilar region with associated volume loss manifested by inferior displacement of the minor fissure and right hilum. The appearance favors atelectasis, but aspiration could have a similar radiographic appearance. Surgical chain sutures are present in the lingula with adjacent linear scarring as well as linear atelectasis at the left base. Questionable small left pleural effusion. No visible pneumothorax.
