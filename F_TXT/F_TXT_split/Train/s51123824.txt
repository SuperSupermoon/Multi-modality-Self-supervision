There has been interval extubation and removal of the esophageal catheter. Mediastinal drains have also been removed. Right-sided central venous catheter appears similarly positioned. Lung volumes are low with slightly improved retrocardiac atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected. Heart and mediastinal contours are stable; calcification along the left ventricular contour is noted. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema. A small amount of pneumomediastinum persists but is decreased compared to prior.
