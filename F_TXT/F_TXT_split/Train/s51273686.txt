No definite free intraperitoneal air is evident, but the appearance of partially layering small pleural effusions suggests that the radiograph was performed in a semi upright rather than fully upright position. With this in mind, if there remains strong clinical suspicion for free intraperitoneal air, a left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen or a fully upright chest radiograph would be recommended. Exam is otherwise remarkable for worsening bibasilar atelectasis.
