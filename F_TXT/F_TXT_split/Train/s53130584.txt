An endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 9 cm from the carina, at the level of the thoracic inlet. An enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, and off the inferior borders of the film. Remainder of the examination is unchanged. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are similar. Persistent retrocardiac opacity likely reflective of atelectasis is present. Deformity of the left ninth and tenth posterolateral ribs may again reflect acute or subacute rib fractures.
