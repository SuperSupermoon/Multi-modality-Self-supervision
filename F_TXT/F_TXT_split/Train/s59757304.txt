Small loculated lateral right pneumothorax has minimally decreased in size, with pigtail pleural catheter remaining in place. Interstitial edema has slightly worsened in the interval, and multifocal heterogeneous opacities in the right lung, attributed to multifocal pneumonia, are similar except for slight worsening in the right upper lobe. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged as well as a probable small left pleural effusion.
