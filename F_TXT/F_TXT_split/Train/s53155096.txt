Lung bases are partially obscured by overlying pulse generator devices bilaterally. There is no pneumothorax. Opacity at the left lung base most likely represents atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. There is also subtle opacification of the left apex, which may represent pleural scarring. No large pleural effusions are seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Patient is kyphotic. No acute osseous abnormalities are identified. Surgical clips are seen in the epigastric region.
