The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina. A right vascular introducer sheath terminates near the junction between the right internal jugular and subclavian veins. A left subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The aortic arch is calcified. Although the right lung appears clear, there is opacification of the left lower hemithorax suggesting, most likely, a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, although not specific. There is no pneumothorax.
