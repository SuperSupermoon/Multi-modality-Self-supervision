Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There is no evident pneumothorax. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is accentuated by the projection. Widened mediastinum is a combination of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and probably adjacent loculated fluid. Right IJ catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Bibasilar consolidations, larger on the right side, are grossly unchanged. This could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Left perihilar atelectasis is unchanged. Right chest tube is in unchanged position. Small bilateral pleural effusions are decreased minimally on the left. There is mild vascular congestion.
