The heart is mild to moderately enlarged. Mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta is noted. The pulmonary vascularity is minimally prominent. Streaky left mid and lower lung opacities are probably compatible with minor atelectasis, but there is also a vague retrocardiac opacity. There is more widespread but patchy opacification involving the right lower lung, probably in the right middle lobe, raising concern for pneumonia.
