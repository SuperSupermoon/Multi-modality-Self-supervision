CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 20:14 p.m., the ET and NG tubes have been removed. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Allowing for considerable differences in technique and positioning, there is possible more pronounced opacity at the left base, though this could be accentuated by the technical differences. Otherwise, no significant change is identified.
