There has been interval increase in the subcutaneous emphysema involving the right lateral chest wall and neck soft tissues. A right chest tube remains in place. There are stable postoperative changes in the right hemithorax with associated volume loss. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Left lung is grossly clear. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pulmonary edema. A tiny lucency projecting beneath the right hemidiaphragm may represent pneumoperitoneum. This should be assessed on followup imaging.
