In comparison with the study of ___, there is an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 2.2 cm above the carina. Obliquity of the patient makes it difficult to compare the mediastinal structures. Cardiac silhouette appears to be enlarged with tortuosity of the aorta. Some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The basilar regions are very difficult to assess due to overlying soft tissues. The hemidiaphragms are not well seen, suggesting a combination of volume loss and pleural effusions bilaterally. Repeat study could be helpful. A nasogastric tube extends to the stomach.
