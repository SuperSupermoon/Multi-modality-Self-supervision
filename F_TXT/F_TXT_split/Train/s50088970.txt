An endotracheal tube has been removed and replaced with a new tracheostomy. The upper mediastinal and tracheal contours are not optimally, but the tracheostomy appears within normal limits. A left-sided PICC line and right internal jugular venous catheter appear unchanged. There is still a chest tube in the left lower hemithorax, where there is persistent retrocardiac opacification and a pleural effusion, not significantly changed. A pigtail catheter has been removed from the more inferior left lower lateral hemithorax, however. The lungs appear otherwise essentially clear. There is no pneumothorax. No mediastinal air is identified. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.
