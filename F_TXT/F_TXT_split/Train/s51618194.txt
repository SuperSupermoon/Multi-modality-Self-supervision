Right IJ central line terminates in the distal SVC. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged compared to the prior study, consistent with postoperative changes. Lung volumes are low. Dense consolidation along the right lung base and hyperlucency of the right upper lobe consistent with right lower lobe collapse. Increased retrocardiac opacity at the left lung base consistent with increased atelectasis. Subcutaneous emphysema extending from the neck to the lateral chest bilaterally is slightly improved compared to prior study. No pneumothorax is seen.
