Severe interstitial fibrosis with basilar predominance, accompanied by marked right middle and bilateral lower lobe volume loss. Coexisting emphysema in the upper lobes is suspected. Heart size is mildly enlarged. There is enlargement of the main pulmonary trunk compatible with central pulmonary hypertension. Streaky retrocardiac opacity, likely represents atelectasis although infectious pneumonia is difficult to exclude. No focal lung consolidation seen. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
