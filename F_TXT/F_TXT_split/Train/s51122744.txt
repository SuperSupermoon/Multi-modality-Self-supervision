The right hilar and adjacent mediastinal adenopathy and masslike consolidation in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe seen on the neck CT on ___ are extremely subtle, manifested as none physiologic shape any increase radiodensity to the right hilus and partial obliteration of the lumen of the right main bronchus. I would recommend chest CT for full evaluation. Heart is mildly enlarged. Lungs are otherwise clear. Pleural effusions not appreciable. No pneumothorax.
