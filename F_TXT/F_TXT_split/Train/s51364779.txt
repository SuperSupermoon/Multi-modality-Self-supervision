Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Heart size is enlarged. There is substantial interval progression of widespread parenchymal opacities, again with denser opacities in the right upper lobe, followed by the right lower lung and then left perihilar area. Left retrocardiac opacity is consistent with area of atelectasis. Bilateral pleural effusions are present. No pneumothorax is seen. The appearance is consistent with gradually progressing pulmonary edema from interstitial demonstrated on ___, radiograph to alveolar on subsequent studies. More asymmetric appearance of the right upper lobe might be consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema versus focal area of infection and should be closely followed. Overall, the extent of the pulmonary edema is slightly better than on ___, but worse than on ___.
