In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes appear in good position. The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter is probably in the proximal aspect of the right pulmonary artery. No evidence of pneumothorax or change in the appearance of the ECMO catheter. The left hemidiaphragm is poorly seen and there is hazy opacification at the base, consistent with layering effusion and compressive atelectasis. There may well be similar changes on the right.
