Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Heart size is mildly enlarged which might be exaggerated by the semi-upright portable study. Left retrocardiac opacity is seen, most likely consistent with atelectasis. Mild vascular engorgement is noted, but no overt edema is seen. Continued surveillance is recommended.
