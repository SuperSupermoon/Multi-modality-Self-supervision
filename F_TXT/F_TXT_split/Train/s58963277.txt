There has been some interval partial re-expansion of the left upper lung but there continues to be dense retrocardiac and lower lobe opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. There is infiltrate and volume loss in the right lower lobe as well. There is hazy bilateral vasculature with pulmonary vascular redistributionAnd engorgement of the central vasculature.
