NG tube tip is in the stomach with the proximal port above the gastroesophageal junction. The stomach is less distended than on the prior study. Again seen is a radiopacity projecting over the gastric bubble that likely represents an aspirated tooth. The ET tube is 4 cm above the carina. There is mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular redistribution.
