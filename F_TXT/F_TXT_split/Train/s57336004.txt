Multiple median sternotomy wires are identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable, within normal limits. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. Slight opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle likely reflects crowding of normal bronchovascular structures. Otherwise, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation. Mild interstitial prominence, with prominent interlobular septa, is compatible with pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no frank pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
