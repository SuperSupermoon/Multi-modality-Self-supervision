The endotracheal tube terminates 3.8 cm above the carina. The heart size remains normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural effusion. An orogastric tube extends to at least the level of the stomach, beyond the scope of this study. Cholecystectomy clips are incidentally noted.
