As compared to the previous radiograph, a new feeding tube has been inserted. A part of the tube is coiled in the stomach. The lung volumes remain low. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Relatively severe elevation of the left hemidiaphragm causes atelectatic areas at the left lung bases. There is mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No new focal parenchymal opacities.
