There is a right-sided central catheter which terminates in the right atrium. Right-sided PIC line terminates at the mid SVC. There is moderate cardiomegaly with evidence of mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and mild bilateral pulmonary edema, overall slightly worse compared to the prior exam. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions appear stable, however, may be redistributed. There is no pneumothorax.
