Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Widespread bilateral heterogeneous pulmonary opacities appear similar to prior studies of ___ and ___ allowing for differences in technique between the exams. However, the degree of ground-glass opacification in the lungs has increased compared to older radiograph ___ ___. Considering extensive findings of traction bronchiectasis and architectural distortion on an outside CT of ___, the observed findings could represent progressive worsening of a diffuse chronic interstitial lung disease such as chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Acute exacerbation of chronic interstitial lung disease and pneumonia or edema superimposed upon chronic lung disease are additional considerations.
