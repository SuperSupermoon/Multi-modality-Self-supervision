Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Triple lead left-sided AICD is seen with leads in the expected positions of the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus. Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 5 cm above level of the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm however the side port appears in the distal esophagus/ GE junction and should be advanced so that it is well within the stomach. Left base opacity may be due to pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
