Single portable semi-upright view of the chest demonstrates an ET tube in appropriate position, terminating approximately 4 cm from the carina. Enteric tube terminates in the stomach. There is a left-sided pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle as expected. A right-sided pleural effusion also layers into the fissure. There is also probably a small left-sided pleural effusion as well. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures with increase perihilar haziness is a combination of low lung volumes but also mild pulmonary edema given the batwing-type distribution. There are no focal consolidations which are concerning for pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in patient position and technique.
