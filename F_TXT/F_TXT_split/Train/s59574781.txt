An endotracheal tube terminates 4.3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is coiled within the stomach. Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted. There is no lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly larger compared to the prior study and there is pulmonary vascular redistribution.
