The patient is markedly rotated towards the right. A focal convexity along the left descending thoracic aortic interface probably reflects accentuation of a tortuous aorta by patient rotation, as ectasia of the aorta is evident in this region on recent CTA of ___, but no focal aneurysmal dilation in this region. No focal areas of consolidation are evident within the lungs, and no pleural effusions are evident. However, given limitations of the study due to marked rotation, a repeat non-rotated radiograph may be helpful for more complete assessment of the medial right lung base, which is partially obscured by the heart.
