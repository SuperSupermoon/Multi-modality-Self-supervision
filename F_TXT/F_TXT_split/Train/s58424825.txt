As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing perihilar left-sided opacity has slightly increased in extent and density. The change suggests the presence of an infectious process. Mild increase in extent of a left pleural effusion with subsequent atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung areas. Unchanged plate-like atelectasis at the right lung bases. No pneumothorax. The patient remains intubated, with a left PICC line and a nasogastric tube in situ.
