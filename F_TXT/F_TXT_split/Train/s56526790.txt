AP chest compared to ___: Pulmonary edema had improved between ___ and ___. Today, there is worsening of both the interstitial component of edema in the upper lungs and the confluent consolidation at both lung bases, as well as an increase in pleural effusion, at least moderate in size. Whether this reflects worsening of the edema, cardiac or otherwise, or is just a reflection of the end of positive pressure ventilator support following extubation is radiographically indeterminate. It should be noted that the heart has never been enlarged. Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
