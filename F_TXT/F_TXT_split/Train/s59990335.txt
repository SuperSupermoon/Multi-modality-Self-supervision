In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Diffuse opacification is again seen in the right hemithorax, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. Obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with layering effusion and compressive atelectasis at the base. Less prominent changes are seen at the left base. Some of the increased opacification on the right could be a manifestation of asymmetric edema.
