The ET tube, NG tube, and left chest tube are unchanged. There is a mildly displaced left lateral rib fracture as visualized on the prior study. There are bilateral lower lobe opacities that have worsened compared to prior studies compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion left greater than right. There is an unusual area of lucency adjacent to the right hilum extending superiorly on the right that could represent some mediastinal air. The left posterior rib fractures are better visualized on the reference CT.
