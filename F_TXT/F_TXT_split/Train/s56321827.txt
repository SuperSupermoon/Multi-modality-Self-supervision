Single portable view of the chest is compared to CT of the chest from ___. Linear opacities in the left mid lung are suggestive of scarring. Surgical chain sutures also seen suggesting prior resection. There is obscuration of the left lateral costophrenic angle compatible with prominent fat identified on CT. Elsewhere, the lungs are clear without confluent consolidation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Anterior lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal fixation hardware is identified. The osseous structures are otherwise grossly unremarkable.
