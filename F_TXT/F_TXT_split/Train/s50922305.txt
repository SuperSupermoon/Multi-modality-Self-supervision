Very large cardiac silhouette, substantially increased since ___, is due in part to large pericardial effusion seen on the chest ___ ___ drainage catheter projects over the cardiac apex. The second device with a metallic tip marker of projects over the left lower lobe bronchus. I do not know if left lower lobe is largely ectatic and that is part of the pericardiocentesis apparatus or external. Clinical correlation is needed. Left lower lobe is largely atelectatic, and there is some pleural effusion. Right lung is grossly clear. No pneumothorax on either side.
