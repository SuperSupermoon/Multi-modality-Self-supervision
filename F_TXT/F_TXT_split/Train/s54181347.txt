Assessment is limited by patient positioning. Lung volumes remain low. Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. Crowding of bronchovascular structures persists without overt pulmonary edema. There is continued patchy opacities in both lung bases, which may reflect atelectasis and/or aspiration, not substantially changed in the interval. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Fracture of the left sixth posterior rib is unchanged.
