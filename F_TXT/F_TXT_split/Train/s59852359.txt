An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.4 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, the tip terminates in the gastric fundus. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles could reflect pleural effusions.
