Dilated descending thoracic aorta is similar in appearance to ___ scout image, and a moderate to large left pleural effusion is probably similar to the transverse CT images, but difficult to accurately compare by volume due to modality differences. If precise comparison is deemed warranted clinically, CT would be more sensitive for detecting changes. Adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis is present.
