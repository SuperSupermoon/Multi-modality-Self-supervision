Portable single AP chest radiograph was obtained with patient in upright position. There has been interval removal of the right chest tube with development of a small right apical pneumothorax. There is no mediastinal shift. At the left lung base opacity is unchanged, likely related to atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pulmonary edema is seen. Cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits.
