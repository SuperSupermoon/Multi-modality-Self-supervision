Tip of the endotracheal tube is in standard position. Patient rotation and relatively low lung volumes accentuate the cardiomediastinal contours. Note is made of previous right upper lobe resection with associated volume loss in right hemithorax. Pulmonary edema pattern in the left lung has slightly improved. Small to moderate left pleural effusion persists, and there is also a new moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent right lower lobe atelectasis.
