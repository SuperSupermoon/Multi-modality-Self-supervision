As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pneumothorax has decreased in extent, notably the apical portion of the pneumothorax. At the lung bases, the extent of the pneumothorax is unchanged. Unchanged non-displaced rib fractures on the right, with subsequent parenchymal opacities and areas of atelectasis in the perihilar lung regions. On the left, a new atelectasis has developed in the perihilar lung regions. There is no evidence of an apical left pneumothorax but a periaortic lucent line should receive attention on further examinations. The Dobbhoff catheter has been removed.
