Opacification at the lung bases than has improved on the right probably a combination of decreasing basal consolidation and small right pleural effusion, while on the left it has remained stable, with a configuration suggesting early edema. Severe cardiomegaly is larger today than on ___ and mediastinal veins are considerably distended. Tip of the right pigtail PIC line projects over the mid SVC, but localization would require at least PA and lateral views. No pneumothorax.
