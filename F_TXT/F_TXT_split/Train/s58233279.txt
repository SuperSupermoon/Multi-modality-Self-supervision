Tracheostomy and right subclavian line tip are in unchanged appropriate positions. There is a interval increase in the cardiac silhouette as well as distension of the azygos vein, findings that might reflect volume overload or potentially pericardial effusion and correlation with echocardiography is required 2 there is also interval development of vascular congestion that is consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema. Right basal opacity most likely represents a combination of atelectasis and pulmonary edema. No interval increase in pleural effusion or pneumothorax demonstrated. Part of the lower lobe opacity demonstrated in the chest radiograph corresponds to pneumonia suspected on recent CT abdomen.
