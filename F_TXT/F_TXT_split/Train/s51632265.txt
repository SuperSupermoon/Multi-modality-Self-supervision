As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has been advanced. The tip of the tube is now in the stomach but not included in the current film. The right effusion with subsequent areas of atelectasis as well as the left retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged in severity and extent. Overall, the radiolucency of the lung parenchyma has decreased, potentially caused by a decrease in ventilatory pressure. No pneumothorax. No new parenchymal opacities. The second pre-existing feeding tube has been removed in the interval.
