Heart size is normal. Calcified lymph nodes are present in the aorticopulmonary window, and scattered calcified granulomas are evident within the lungs. No focal areas of consolidation are identified within either lung. Left costophrenic sulcus region is not well visualized, however, and the possibility of a small left pleural effusion or peripheral lung abnormality in this region cannot be excluded. Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for more complete evaluation of this region when the patient's condition allows if warranted clinically.
