In comparison to the chest radiographs obtained 6 days prior, there is a mild, right apical pneumothorax without tension, a right-sided chest tube, ipsilateral subcutaneous emphysema, and bilaterally decreased lung volumes status-post open right upper lobectomy. Low left lung volumes increase interstitial markings, but there is probably also mild pulmonary edema. Heart size is top normal.
