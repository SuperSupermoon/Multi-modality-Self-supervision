In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube is been removed. There has been placement of a Dobhoff tube, though the opaque tip is only in the midesophagus. Subsequent study dictated previously shows the tip in a catheter, of bone not satisfactory, position. There appears to be some improvement in the bibasilar opacification.
