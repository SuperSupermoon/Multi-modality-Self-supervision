Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Patient has known emphysema. Nodules and irregular opacities in the left upper lobe and right lower lobe are better seen in prior CT. Increase opacities in the right lower lobe could be atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no pneumothorax or effusion.
