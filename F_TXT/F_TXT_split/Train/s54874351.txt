The repositioned NG tube has been advanced, now with tip projecting over the expected region of the stomach above the diaphragm, corresponding to known hiatal hernia. The stomach/hernia appears distended with gas and layering fluid. A right subclavian line ends in the low SVC, unchanged. Increased opacity in the left lower lobe likely reflects persistent atelectasis. No new focal consolidation, large effusion, or pneumothorax. Streaky linear opacities in the right lower lung are likely atelectasis. Surgical clips are seen in the right neck.
