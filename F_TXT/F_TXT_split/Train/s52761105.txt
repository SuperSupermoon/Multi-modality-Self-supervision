Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. There are lower lung volumes. Otherwise, there has been no change in extensive bilateral diffuse lung consolidation, likely representing an organizing fibrosis, or progressing stage for ARDS. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. NG tube tip is coiled in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.
