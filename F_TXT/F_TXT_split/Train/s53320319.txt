Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta again noted. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Streaky opacity in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine. Known osseous lesions are better assessed on the previous CT scan.
