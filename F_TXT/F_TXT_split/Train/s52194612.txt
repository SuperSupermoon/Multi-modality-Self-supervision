There is no radiographic evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax following recent bronchoscopy procedure. Overall appearance of the chest is not appreciably changed since the recent radiograph except for resolution of linear atelectasis at the right lung base and slight worsening of linear scar or atelectasis in the lingular region. Postoperative changes related to previous left lower lobe lobectomy are similar.
