There has been interval removal of the right central line and IVC filter. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with minimal subsegmental atelectasis persists though appears improved from prior. No confluent opacity is identified to suggest pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. A calcified granuloma in the right lower lobe appears similar to prior.
