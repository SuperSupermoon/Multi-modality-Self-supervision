In comparison to the examination from 2 hours prior, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube which ends in the mid thoracic trachea. A left central venous line which ends in the mid SVC is new. An enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm and terminates in the region of the stomach. Deformities of the right chest wall are unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusions are small to moderate. Volume loss at the right lung base is mildly worsened.
