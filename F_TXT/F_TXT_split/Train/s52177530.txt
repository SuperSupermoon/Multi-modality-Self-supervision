The ETT is in standard position. The single lead left chest AICD appears intact and unchanged in position. The lung volumes remain low. Compared to the prior exam, increased opacities in the bilateral lung bases may be secondary to dependent bilateral pleural effusions on a semi-erect exam today compared to an upright exam on the prior and are slightly worse. Retrocardiac opacity persists and may reflect underlying atelectasis or underlying pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly is overall unchanged. Mild moderate pulmonary vascular congestion is likely. No mediastinal widening. No pneumothorax. Mild Levoconvex scoliosis of the lower thoracic spine is unchanged. The enteric tube traverses the diaphragm but the tip is not seen. The stomach is distended.
