Lung volumes remain low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature. Mild pulmonary edema has slightly worsened compared to the prior study from ___. Subsegmental right upper lung atelectasis is increased. Dense retrocardiac atelectasis has also slightly increased, likely atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are not excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is not significantly changed. Enlargement of the azygos contour is unchanged, suggestive of venous distention.
