AP chest reviewed in conjunction with torso CT on ___: Small left pleural effusion and left basal consolidation have increased slightly since ___. Findings are concerning for either infection or given the appropriate history, trauma to the left hemidiaphragm. If the findings are not understood, I would recommend a repeat chest CT to include the left upper abdominal quadrant. The right lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouettes are normal.
