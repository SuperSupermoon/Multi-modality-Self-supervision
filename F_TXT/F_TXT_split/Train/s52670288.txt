Interval placement of endotracheal tube, with tip terminating 5 cm above the carina. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Large, partially loculated right pleural effusion appears similar to the prior study, and adjacent areas of atelectasis or consolidation in the right mid and lower lung also appear similar. However, on the left, there is an increased pleural effusion, now small-to-moderate in size with adjacent worsening opacity in the left retrocardiac region.
