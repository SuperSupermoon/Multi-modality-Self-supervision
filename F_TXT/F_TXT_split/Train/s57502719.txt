There are scattered nodular parenchymal opacities throughout the right mid and upper lung with associated right paratracheal and hilar soft tissue consistent with known metastatic disease and lymphadenopathy. There is a right pleural effusion which has somewhat increased in size. Patchy opacity at the right base could reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. The left lung remains grossly clear. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Sutures overlying the right humeral head and right upper quadrant biliary stent are again seen. Prominent splenic arterial calcifications.
