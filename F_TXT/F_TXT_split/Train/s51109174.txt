Endotracheal tube is in standard position, terminating approximately 6.4 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is new in the interval, which appears to course to the level of the diaphragm, though the distal aspect is not well assessed. Remainder of the exam is unchanged with continued low lung volumes. Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is again noted. There is unchanged mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded in the left lung base. Small left pleural effusion is likely present. Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is again noted.
