The heart size is mildly enlarged and there is mild pulmonary vascular re-distribution with perihilar haze that is worse when compared to the prior study. There are small bilateral pleural effusions with increased opacity at both bases which likely represents volume loss, although early infiltrate cannot be excluded. The overall impression is that of CHF.
