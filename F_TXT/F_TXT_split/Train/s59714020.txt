A single portable frontal upright view of the chest was obtained. There is interval placement of a dialysis catheter through a left subclavian approach terminating in the right atrium. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is persistent bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with adjacent compressive atelectasis most notable at the right base. There is diffusely increased bilateral opacification, more pronounced in the perihilar regions consistent with increased pulmonary venous congestion and moderate edema. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal silhouette is otherwise stable.
