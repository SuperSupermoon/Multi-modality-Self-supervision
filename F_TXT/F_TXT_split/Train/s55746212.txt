In comparison with the study of ___, there has been some decrease in opacification at the right base, again worrisome for pneumonia. The right hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, possibly a manifestation of improved lung volumes. At the left base, the hemidiaphragm is poorly seen medially with mild opacification above the its lateral aspect. This could represent atelectasis, though in view of the changes on the right multifocal pneumonia would have to be considered. There is an placement of a left IJ catheter with its tip in the mid to lower SVC.
