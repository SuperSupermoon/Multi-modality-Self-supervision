Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube, and dual lead left-sided pacer unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There are layering bilateral effusions with bibasilar patchy opacities suggestive of atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Patchy opacities in the right lung are essentially stable and are concerning for an infectious process. Clinical correlation is recommended. No pneumothorax.
