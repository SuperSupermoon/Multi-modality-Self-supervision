AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are lower, patient positioning is more recumbent, both of which contribute to a greater lateral sweep to the ascending thoracic aorta and change in the mediastinal caliber accordingly. However, it should be noted that unless there were a large scale mediastinal bleeding or dissection, an acute change in mediastinal caliber might not be appreciated on conventional chest radiographs. Heart size top normal, unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature also slightly more engorged, but there is no pulmonary edema and pleural effusion if any is not substantial. No pneumothorax.
