In comparison with the study, there is little overall change. Huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with relatively normal vessels, consistent with the patient's known pericardial effusion. Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the right base. No acute focal pneumonia identified. Of incidental note is kyphoplasty in the upper lumbar region.
