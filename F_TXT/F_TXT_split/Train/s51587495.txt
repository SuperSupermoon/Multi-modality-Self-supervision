AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates no pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube is stable in position approximately 6 cm above the carina. As before, the tip of the nasogastric tube can only be seen to the level of the distal esophagus and should be advanced. There is persistent bibasilar opacification, with small bilateral pleural effusions, and enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette, consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
