In comparison with the study of to ___, the 2 chest tubes remain in the right hemithorax without evidence of pneumothorax. There has been some decrease in the subcutaneous gas along the right lateral chest wall and extending into the neck. Bilateral increased basilar opacification is again consistent with some combination of pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis. Endotracheal tube is essentially unchanged.
