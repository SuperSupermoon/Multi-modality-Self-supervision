Small right apical pneumothorax unchanged since ___. Small right pleural effusion increased following removal of the right pleural drainage catheter. Small left pleural effusion stable. Apparent increase in the already moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette is probably a function of lower lung volumes rather than real cardiomegaly. Pulmonary vascular engorgement persists but there is no good evidence for pulmonary edema. Opacification of both Lung bases, increased on the right since ___, is probably atelectasis. Left PIC line ends in the low left SVC. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads in standard placements.
