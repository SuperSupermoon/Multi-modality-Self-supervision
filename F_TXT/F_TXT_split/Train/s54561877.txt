As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube has been removed. There is no safe evidence for the presence of a right pneumothorax. The patient remains intubated and the nasogastric tube as well as the left subclavian access line are unchanged. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities and moderate cardiomegaly as well as the known multiple partly displaced rib and scapular fractures are constant in appearance.
