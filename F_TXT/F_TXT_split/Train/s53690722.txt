Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position given differences in patient positioning. Given the marked patient rotation, assessment of cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult. There continues to be bilateral layering effusions with associated patchy bibasilar airspace disease likely reflecting atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Interval appearance of a patchy opacity in the right mid lung of uncertain significance. This can be further evaluated on followup imaging. Stable 3 mm nodular opacity in the left upper lobe unchanged since ___ and therefore consistent with a benign finding. No pneumothorax.
