A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a lobulated mass in the inferior right perihilar region, which is unchanged. Increased opacity in the lateral right mid lung is new and concerning for pneumonia. A retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis, is unchanged. Multiple lung nodules seen on recent CT chest are not clearly seen on today's study. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
