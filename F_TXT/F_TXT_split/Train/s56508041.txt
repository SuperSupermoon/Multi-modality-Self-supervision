In comparison with the study of ___ in there is little change. Right pigtail catheter remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax or recurrent pleural effusion. On the left, the hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen and there is hazy opacification at the base, consistent with layering effusion. Is unclear whether this change reflect a new development of pleural fluid or merely a more recumbent position of the patient.
