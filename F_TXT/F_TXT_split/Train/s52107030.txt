In comparison with the study of ___, the patient is no longer rotated. The left subclavian catheter tip now lies at or just above the cavoatrial junction. Dobbhoff tube extends well into the stomach. The endotracheal tube appears to have been removed. The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Hazy opacification at the bases could reflect some small layering effusions with compressive atelectasis. Poor definition of the medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe.
