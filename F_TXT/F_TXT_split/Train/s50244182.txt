There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Given this, there appears to be minimal pulmonary vascular congestion. No focal consolidation is seen. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles is likely due to overlying soft tissue. No large pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
