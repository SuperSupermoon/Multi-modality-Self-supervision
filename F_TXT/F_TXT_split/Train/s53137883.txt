Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.3 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube tip terminates below the diaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film. The heart size is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There are low lung volumes. This results in crowding of the bronchovascular markings. Patchy opacities at the lung bases may reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. A possible small left pleural effusion may be present. No pneumothorax is identified.
