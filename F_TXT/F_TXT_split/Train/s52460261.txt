Endotracheal tube terminates 4.4 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, terminating in the left upper quadrant. There has been interval placement of right internal jugular central venous catheter which terminates in the lower SVC, without evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Mild interstitial edema persists. Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity is again seen which may be due to atelectasis although infection or aspiration are not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion is seen although small pleural effusion, particularly on the left, difficult to exclude.
