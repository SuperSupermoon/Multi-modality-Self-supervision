Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There is bibasalar atelectasis, left greater than right. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. There is enlargement of the bilateral hila, with increased density of the right hila, which may be related to enlargement of the main pulmonary artery or lymphadenopathy. There is mild vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema. There is cardiomegaly, the extent of which cannot be easily assessed on this image. There is no pneumothorax.
