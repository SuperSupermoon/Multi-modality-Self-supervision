Vascular catheter and feeding tube remain in place, with tip of feeding tube in the proximal stomach. Improved lung volumes compared to the previous study, as well as near resolution of previously reported pulmonary edema and markedly improved aeration at the right lung base. There remains dense opacity in left retrocardiac region, possibly a combination of atelectasis and effusion, but underlying infectious process in this region is also possible. Right pleural effusion has decreased in size with only a small residual effusion remaining.
