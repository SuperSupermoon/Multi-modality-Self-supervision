A chest tube projects over the base of the right hemithorax. There is a small quantity of subcutaneous emphysema but no indication of substantial pneumothorax. A trace pneumothorax is suspected, however, on the right. There is no evidence for pleural effusion. The lungs appear clear. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable within the limitations of technique. Right second through fourth rib fractures are markedly displaced. There are also non-displaced fractures involving right posterior sixth and seventh ribs although the age of the latter fractures is difficult to assess. Given the limitations of technique, additional injuries are difficult to exclude.
