Since prior, there is no significant change. Lung volumes are low. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Streaky bibasilar linear opacities are compatible with atelectasis. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Slight blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally may be due to trace pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
