As compared to ___ radiograph, the left hemi thorax is now nearly completely opacified with probable shift of the mediastinum towards the right, although patient rotation limits assessment of this factor. Overall appearance of the opacities in the left hemi thorax, which are more prominent peripherally than centrally, favor a large multiloculated pleural effusion as the predominant finding, coexisting with adjacent Lung atelectasis with only a small amount of residual aerated lung in the left juxta hilar region. In the setting of recent cardiovascular surgery, hemothorax should be considered.
