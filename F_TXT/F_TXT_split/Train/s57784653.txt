Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 5:06 p.m. The current examination demonstrates unchanged appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette including prominence of the main pulmonary arteries that may be consistent with pulmonary arterial enlargement. Widespread parenchymal opacities appear to be improved and might be consistent with interval improvement of pulmonary edema. No new abnormalities demonstrated and small amount of bilateral pleural effusion is most likely present.
