AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-erect position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained one and a half hours earlier during the same day. During the interval, an NG tube has been placed but is seen to reach well below the diaphragm, pointing in the stomach in the direction towards the pylorus. No interval changes are seen on the portable chest examination in comparison with the preceding study.
