The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter projects over the left pulmonary artery. Sternal wires are in unchanged position. The lung volumes remain low. There are bilateral parenchymal opacities suggesting mild to moderate centralized pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.
