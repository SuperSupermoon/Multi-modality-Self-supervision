Since the prior study, there has been interval improvement in aeration of the right lung, particularly in the infrahilar region. Persistent opacification in the suprahilar left lung is compatible with known mass, with postobstructive atelectasis. A small pleural effusion on the left persists. There is no pneumothorax or overt pulmonary edema. The heart size is stable. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
