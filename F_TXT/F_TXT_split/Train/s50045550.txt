In comparison with the study ___ ___, the right IJ catheter has been pulled back so that the tip is in the lower SVC. Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged without appreciable vascular congestion. However, there is increased opacification at the bases silhouetting the hemidiaphragms, consistent with layering pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis on both sides. It is possible that a more supine position of the patient could be contributing to this difference in appearance.
