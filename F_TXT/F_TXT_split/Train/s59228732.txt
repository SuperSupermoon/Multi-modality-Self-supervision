A loop of the transesophageal drainage tube have projects over the mouth. I cannot tell whether it is internal or external. Distally it passes into the stomach and out of view. The severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality that progressed from ___ through ___ is still worse today. It cannot be presumed to be edema because of its heterogeneous distribution and some areas of nodulation suggesting acinar filling. This is more typical of widespread pneumonia and/or pulmonary hemorrhage than edema even though some edema may well be present. It obscures cardiac silhouette, but I doubt there is been much change in previously imaged mild cardiomegaly. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. There is no pneumothorax.
