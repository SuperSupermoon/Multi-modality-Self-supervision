Comparison is made with prior study ___. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Moderate pulmonary edema has improved. There is persistent opacity in the right upper lobe that could be due to asymmetric edema but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Bibasilar opacities have improved consistent with improving atelectasis and adjacent pleural effusions.
