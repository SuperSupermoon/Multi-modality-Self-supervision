AP chest compared to ___ and ___: Since ___, mediastinal and pulmonary veins have increased in caliber, and there are new septal lines at the base of the right lung. All these findings point to acute cardiac decompensation, although top normal heart size has not appreciably changed. There is also greater heterogeneous peribronchial opacification in the right lower lobe. This could be asymmetric edema since the right lower lobe is usually most severely affected. I would maintain close surveillance to exclude concurrent right lower lobe pneumonia.
