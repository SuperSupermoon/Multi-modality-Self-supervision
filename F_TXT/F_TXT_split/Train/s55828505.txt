In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of an orogastric tube with the tip extending at least to the lower portion of the stomach. Hazy opacification at the left base is consistent with layering pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. The left costophrenic angle has been excluded from the study.
