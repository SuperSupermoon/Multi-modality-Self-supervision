Bibasilar and right mid lung opacities are seen. There is minimal biapical scarring as well. Given the patient's rotation, the mediastinum appears to be within normal limits. There is no overt pulmonary edema. 2.1 mm rounded structure in the right hilus may be a partially calcified lymph node. There is no large pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax. A lucency under the left hemidiaphragm is most likely colon or the gastric bubble. Free air cannot be ruled out. If there is concern for the patient's abdominal exam, a lateral decubitus film would be helpful.
