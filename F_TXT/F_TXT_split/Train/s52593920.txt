As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged position of the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, internal jugular vein catheter, and ECG clips. The lung parenchyma is more radiolucent at the lung bases, likely reflecting improved ventilation. This is true on both the right and the left, in particular the retrocardiac lung areas. No new opacities. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without overt pulmonary edema.
