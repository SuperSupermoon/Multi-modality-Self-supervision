There is a new left pectoral atrial bi-ventricular pacer/defibrillator system in place with unchanged positions of dual leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle and interval placement of a third epicardial lead. There is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax. The lungs are well aerated without focal consolidation or pleural effusions. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged with evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure, improved from the most recent prior chest radiograph. The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple intact appearing wires.
