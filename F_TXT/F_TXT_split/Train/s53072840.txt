AP chest compared to ___: ET tube in standard placement at the thoracic inlet. A paramedian left chest tube in standard placement. No left pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since earlier in the day and a previous large region of atelectasis in the right lung has cleared. Heart is mildly enlarged. A large bore left internal jugular catheter projects over the aortic knob, because of leftward patient rotation and the meandering course of the left brachiocephalic vein in elderly patients.
