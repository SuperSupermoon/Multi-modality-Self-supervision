AP chest compared to ___: The patient first developed left lower lobe consolidation on ___, apparent mild pulmonary edema on ___, which worsened appreciably to ___, and then generally improved. Areas of discrete consolidation in the right upper and lower lung were concerning for pneumonia, even though left lower lobe consolidation had also substantially cleared. Today, the right lower lobe is more clear, while the upper lobe has grown more consolidated. There now becomes the focus of our attention for possible concurrent pneumonia and should be followed to see if instead it slowly clears as asymmetric edema. Both lower lobes are more clear today. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
