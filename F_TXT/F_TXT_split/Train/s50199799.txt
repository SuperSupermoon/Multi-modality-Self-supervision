Lung volumes remain low. Heterogeneous opacification at the base of the left lung is clearing, probably resolving dependent edema. Atelectasis and small to moderate right pleural effusion persist. Hyperlucency in the right upper lobe indicates emphysema. Heart size top normal and unchanged. Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium. No pneumothorax.
