Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiac size is normal. Lines and tubes are in the standard position. Large right and moderate left pleural effusions are grossly unchanged allowing the differences in positioning of the patient. Right upper lobe opacity has improved consistent with improving atelectasis. Pleural effusions are associated with atelectasis, larger on the right side. There is mild vascular congestion.
