The endotracheal tube terminates 4.1 cm above the carina. Enteric tube seen with tip past the GE junction although side port is likely in the distal esophagus. Known right lung mass occupying a majority of the right midlung is better assessed by recent chest CT performed earlier on the same date. There is new right basilar atelectasis medially. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema. There is a blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle in part due to prominent extrapleural fat although underlying effusion is possible. No sizable pleural effusion on the left. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Heart size may be minimally enlarged. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
