1. The heart remains enlarged status post median sternotomy for CABG. Mediastinal contours are stable. Right PICC line has been removed. Although the interstitium remains slightly prominent, no focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. There is possible blunting of the left costophrenic angle, raising the possibility of pleural thickening versus a small effusion. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
