In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices have been removed and there are lower lung volumes. Opacification at the right base persists. Again, this could reflect a combination of asymmetric pulmonary edema with volume loss and possible small effusion. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. There is increased opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm. Again, this most likely reflects atelectasis and effusion, though superimposed infection cannot be definitely excluded.
