In comparison with study of ___, there is increased opacification at the right base consistent with pleural effusion and collapse of the right middle and lower lobes. Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm suggests some pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis on this side. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion. Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
