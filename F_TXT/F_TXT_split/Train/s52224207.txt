Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier. ET tube tip is only 2 cm above the carina, can be withdrawn 1 to 2 cm for more standard position. Marked increased opacity in the left lower lobe is likely due to new large area of atelectasis in the left lower lobe. There is no pneumothorax. There are no other interval changes.
