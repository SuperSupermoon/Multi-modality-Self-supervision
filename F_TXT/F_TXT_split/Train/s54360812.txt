Compared with the prior study, the ET tube is been removed. The NG tube is is again seen, tip over gastric fundus. The side port lies in the region of the GE junction. Right IJ central line tip overlies the upper right atrium, unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with prominent hila bilaterally. Again seen is a mild to moderate right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Of note, this is new compared with ___. Retrocardiac density has progressed to a small degree. Multifocal opacities are similar, but there has probably been slight improvement at the left base laterally. Suspect some element of background CHF.
