Lung volumes are unchanged and within normal limits. The patient is intubated, the endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the level of the carina. A Dobhoff tube terminates in the stomach. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. A right-sided PICC terminates in the right brachiocephalic vein. These are unchanged in appearance when compared to the prior studies. There is increased opacity at the left lung base, likely reflecting atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. No other areas concerning for infection are identified. There is likely a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax seen.
