As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have minimally decreased. Nevertheless, the subtotal collapse of the left lung is partially resolved. At the current time point, there is a remnant perifocal parenchymal opacity and a left lower lobe atelectasis, but the apical portions of the left lung show near normal ventilation. On the right, the extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities has slightly decreased. The right pacemaker leads and the right internal jugular vein catheter are unchanged and normal in appearance. No new focal parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
