Mitral valve and mediastinal clips are unchanged compared to prior exam. The heart size is at the upper limits of normal. The mediastinal contours are not widened. The lungs show no lobar consolidation, but diffuse perihilar airspace opacities compatible with pulmonary edema. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle as well as thickening of the right upper lateral aspect of the pleural space suggests areas of pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
