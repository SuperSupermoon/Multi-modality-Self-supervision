AP chest compared to ___ and ___: Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is increasing. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, which worsened from ___ and ___ to ___ is still present and small left pleural effusion has increased, while mild pulmonary edema has remained unchanged. Findings could all be due to volume overload and cardiac decompensation, but possibility of serositis should be entertained because of the disproportion of increasing effusion to pulmonary edema. Left subclavian infusion port ends low in the SVC. No pneumothorax.
