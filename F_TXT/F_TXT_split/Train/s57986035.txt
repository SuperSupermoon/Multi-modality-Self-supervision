Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 6.1 cm below the level of carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. There are relatively low lung volumes. Opacification projecting over the left costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissue although pleural effusion or consolidation is not excluded. There is also linear medial left basilar atelectasis/scarring. Medial right basilar opacity may be due to vascular crowding, however, underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
