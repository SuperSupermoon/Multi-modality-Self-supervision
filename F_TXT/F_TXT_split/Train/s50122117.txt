Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates three right-sided chest tubes. Small right pneumothorax is noted, which has decreased in size since prior. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle, suggestive of pleural effusion. Right upper lung consolidation is new since prior. Left lung is essentially clear. There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. The heart size is normal. There is no pulmonary edema.
