There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube, which courses superior medially along the upper left hemithorax, projecting close to the superior mediastinum. There has been interval re-expansion of the left lung, with possible small pneumothorax remaining. There is a left pleural effusion and left base opacity which may represent combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis. There is persistent mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle and right base atelectasis. There is concern for nondisplaced fracture of the posterior left 8th rib. Old posterior lateral right 3rd rib fracture is again seen.
