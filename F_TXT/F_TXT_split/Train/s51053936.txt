Lung volumes are low. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced on the left, likely reflect atelectasis. Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with calcification of the thoracic aorta again noted. Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
