1. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. Left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC unchanged. Interval removal of right internal jugular central line. There is pneumoperitoneum, which appears to be slightly more prominent compared to the prior study, but may be related to differences in positioning. Clinical correlation, however, is advised. There is a layering left effusion with a pleural catheter remaining in place and persistent consolidation, suggestive of lower lobe atelectasis, though pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
