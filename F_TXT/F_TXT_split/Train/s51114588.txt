Portable upright AP view of the chest was obtained. Limited study due to patient positioning and low lung volumes. The patient's chin obscures the left upper lung region. Patchy and linear opacities in both lung bases are most likely due to subsegmental basilar atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly. Evaluation of the mediastinal contours is limited due to patient rotation. Possible trace left pleural effusion. The extreme left costophrenic angle is not imaged. There is no free air below the right hemidiaphragm. ___ rods are located in the spine.
