Right-sided IJ introducer catheter is present, with the tip in the right brachiocephalic/SVC junction. Endotracheal tube remains in place, with the tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. NG tube remains in place, extending into the stomach. There is persistent left retrocardiac opacity, presumably representing changes of atelectasis. There is a small-to-moderate persistent left-sided pleural effusion, probably with some regions of loculation given some well-circumscribed opacities at the left lung base, which is probably fluid within the major fissure. There are no new focal pulmonary opacities, pleural effusions, or evidence of pneumothorax. There is probably some scarring seen at the lung apices.
