Widespread subcutaneous emphysema reduces the sensitivity for detecting small pneumothoraces. With this limitation in mind, no definite pneumothorax is detected. The mediastinum does not appear widened. Mild pneumomediastinum is likely postoperative in etiology. Lungs are clear except for patchy atelectasis at the left lung base. Small left pleural effusion is also noted.
