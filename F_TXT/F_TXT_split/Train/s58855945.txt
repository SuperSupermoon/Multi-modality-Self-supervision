Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There are low lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings at the bases. A nodular density at the right base likely represents prominence of pulmonary vascular markings. Subsegmental atelectasis is present at the right base. The visualized right and left upper lung fields are clear. There are no pneumothoraces. Heart size is within normal limits.
