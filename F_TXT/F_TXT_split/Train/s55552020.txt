Feeding tube is seen to course below the diaphragm to the stomach; however, the distal end is beyond the radiograph view. A dual-lumen dialysis catheter through the right internal jugular approach ends at lower cavoatrial junction. Consider retracting the catheter by 2-3 cm for better seatinig. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Bilateral lung volumes are low. Since ___ asymmetric edema in the left lung, mild mediastinal widening likely from congestion is improved. There are no new lung opacities of concern. Small left pleural effusion and left lower lung atelectasis unchanged. No pneumothorax. Heart size is normal.
