There has been interval improvement of the large left pleural effusion and bilateral pulmonary edema. The small right pleural effusion is stable. Again, the cardiac silhouette is enlarged, however, obscured by the left pleural effusion. The tracheostomy tube is in place. The left PIC line terminates in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. The right displaced shoulder fracture is unchanged.
