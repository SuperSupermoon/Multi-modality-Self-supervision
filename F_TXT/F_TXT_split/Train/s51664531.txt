Lung volumes are low. Indistince pulmonary markings could reflect some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. Patchy opacities in the right cardiophrenic angle partially obscure the right cardiac margin. There are also patchy opacities in the left lung base projecting over the cardiac shadow. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac size cannot be properly evaluated in this supine exam. Sternotomy wires are intact.
