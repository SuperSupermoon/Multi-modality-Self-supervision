In comparison with the earlier study of this day, there has been placement of a right pigtail catheter. Small amount of basilar pneumothorax is again seen along with some pleural fluid and atelectatic changes. Extensive subcutaneous gas processes along the right side from the mid cervical to mid abdominal level. Otherwise, little change.
