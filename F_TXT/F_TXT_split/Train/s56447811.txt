AP chest compared to ___ through post-operative chest radiographs ___: Severe widening of the upper mediastinum continues to improve post-operatively and previous pulmonary edema has now cleared. Substantial bibasilar atelectasis left greater than right has not. I do not see a significant pneumothorax and previous small right pleural effusion has virtually resolved. An apical pleural tube is in place. ET tube ends approximately 2 cm above the upper margin of the clavicles, higher than it was yesterday when the patient was supine and the tip was at the upper margin of the manubrium. Tracheobronchial airway is virtually obscured, presumably by edema and secretions, but really not assessed. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Heart is top normal size, exaggerated by low lung volumes.
