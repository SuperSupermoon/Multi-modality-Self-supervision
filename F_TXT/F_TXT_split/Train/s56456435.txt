As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an intra-aortic balloon pump. The tip of the pump projects approximately 10 mm be low the upper most portion of the aortic arch. A pre-existing right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in extent. Mild right basal parenchymal opacity has decreased in severity and likely reflect atelectasis. Improved atelectasis at the left lung base, decrease in size of the cardiac silhouette.
