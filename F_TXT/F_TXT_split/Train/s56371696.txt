Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiac size is obscured by adjacent pleuroparenchymal abnormalities. The aorta is very tortuous. Small right effusion has minimally decreased. Right lower lobe atelectasis has increased. right apical chest tube remains in unchanged position. Left central catheter tip is in the lower SVC. Tiny right apical pneumothorax is stable. Left lower lobe opacities, a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, have minimally increased.
