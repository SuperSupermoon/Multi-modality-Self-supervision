Right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. Status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. Interval worsening of opacities in the right upper and lower lung and in the left mid and lower lung. Although these findings all may reflect worsening moderate to severe pulmonary edema, diffuse pneumonia should also be considered as the opacities are more confluent. Small bilateral layering effusions, left greater than right. No pneumothorax appreciated. Residual contrast is again seen within the known intrathoracic stomach as documented on abdominal CT dated ___.
