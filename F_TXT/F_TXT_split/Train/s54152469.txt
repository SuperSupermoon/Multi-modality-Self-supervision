As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing small left pleural effusion has completely resolved. There is unchanged mild fluid overload, associated with low lung volumes and subsequent increases in bilateral lung radiodensity. Moderate cardiomegaly persists, but the left lower lobe is better ventilated than on previous images. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
