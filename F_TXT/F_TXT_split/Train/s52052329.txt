Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema has worsened. Large bilateral pleural effusions greater on the right side have increased. Cardiac size is obscured by pleural parenchymal abnormalities. Plate-like atelectasis in the left mid lung is again noted.
