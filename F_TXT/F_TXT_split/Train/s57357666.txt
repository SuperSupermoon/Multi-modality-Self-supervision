In comparison with study of ___, there is some increasing prominence of pulmonary vessels suggesting some elevated pulmonary venous pressure in a patient with a stable cardiomegaly. A more confluent, though still patchy, area of opacification on the right could reflect some consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting. The left hemidiaphragm is not well seen, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
