Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. While there is mild prominence of the pulmonary vascularity, no pulmonary edema is seen. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, though an underlying effusion cannot be excluded, nor can infection be excluded. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. There is no acute osseous abnormality.
