Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates persistent substantial subcutaneous soft tissue emphysema in the right lateral chest wall and deep cervical soft tissues. There is marked increase in pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium, raising question of a large bronchopleural connection including the right upper lobe bronchial stump. A right basal approach chest tube terminates apically, stable in location. Previously seen right apical pneumothorax has decreased in size with a small residual apical pneumothorax. The heart is top normal in size. Dense retrocardiac opacity persists compatible with atelectasis. A moderate left pleural effusion is persistent.
