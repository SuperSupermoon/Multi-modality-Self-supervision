The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain stable with moderate cardiomegaly. There may be a small left pleural effusion with a new small left basilar opacity. There is no pneumothorax or right pleural effusion. There is no new focal consolidation; however, left basilar pneumonia is possible in the correct clinical setting.
