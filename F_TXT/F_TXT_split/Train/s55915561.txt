The heart size is mild to moderately enlarged. Aortic knob is prominent, suggesting dilatation of the thoracic aorta. Atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch is present. Opacification within the retrocardiac region may reflect a combination of a small pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Hazy opacification within the mid lung fields is noted. There is no right-sided pleural effusion pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality seen.
