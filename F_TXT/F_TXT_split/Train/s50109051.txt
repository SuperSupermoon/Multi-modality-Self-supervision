Mild bibasilar atelectasis is noted without definite focal consolidation. No large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Slight prominence of the hila suggest pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
