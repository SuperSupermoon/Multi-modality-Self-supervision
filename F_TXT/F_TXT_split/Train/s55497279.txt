The lungs are poorly inflated. There is slight increase in hilar prominence likely due to vascular engorgement. There is stable blunting of the right costophrenic angle. The left costophrenic sulcus is unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged from prior. The blunting of the right pleural sulcus is stable from prior study and is likely related to scarring. Changes in the right seventh posterior rib are also unchanged.
