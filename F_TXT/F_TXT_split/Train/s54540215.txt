Frontal view of the chest was obtained. New tracheostomy tube has been placed. Dobbhoff tube terminates below the diaphragm. Large-bore right subclavian catheter terminates in the right atrium. Heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are similar to prior. Bibasilar opacities are compatible with atelectasis. Heterogeneous left upper lobe opacity is similar to prior and compatible with infection. No pneumothorax.
