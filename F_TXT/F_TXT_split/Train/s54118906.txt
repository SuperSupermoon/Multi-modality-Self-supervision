Bilateral calcified breast implants are present. The heart is normal in size. Perihilar opacity on the right is somewhat striking although not particularly mass-like. This may represent an inflammatory process or atelectasis along the right hilum. More generally, at both lung bases, there are vague opacities which may represent atelectasis. Mid upper lung zones, however, are unremarkable. The stomach is mildly distended.
