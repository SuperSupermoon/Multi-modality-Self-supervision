Portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates the lungs are well expanded and clear. There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. The ascending shadow appears more prominent on this study compared to prior examination, possibly due to differences in imaging technique. There is air within the fundus of the stomach; however, no subdiaphragmatic free air is identified.
