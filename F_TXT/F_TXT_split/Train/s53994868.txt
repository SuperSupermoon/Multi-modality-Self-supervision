Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated, and the mediastinal contours are unchanged. Worsening alveolar opacities are noted predominant within the right mid lung field and left lung base. Continued vascular indistinctness and perihilar haziness is again seen. These findings likely reflect worsening moderate pulmonary edema, though developing areas of infection in the right mid lung field and left lung base cannot be completely excluded. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
