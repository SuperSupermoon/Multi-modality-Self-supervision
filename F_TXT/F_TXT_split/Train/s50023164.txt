AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lungs are low in volume, heart is normal size, and pulmonary vasculature is normal as well. Suggestion of mild interstitial abnormality in the right lower lung could be resolving edema, based on subsequent improvement in chest radiograph performed three hours later available at the time of this review. No appreciable pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.
