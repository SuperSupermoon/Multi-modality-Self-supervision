Compared with ___ at 22:22 , subcutaneous emphysema in the right supraclavicular of the region may be more pronounced. Again seen is a right IJ sheath, with tip over proximal SVC. Note is made of a gap in tubing at the proximal edge of the sheath measuring 6.7 mm. On today's examination 2 small clips are seen in the right neck, away from the sheath and subcutaneous emphysema. In retrospect Beaver present at the edge of the prior film. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular plethora, with bibasilar atelectasis, is similar to the prior study. Cardiomediastinal silhouette I doubt significant interval change. No pleural effusion seen on either side. No obvious pneumothorax detected.
