The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits without change. Streaky left basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis or scarring, but otherwise, the lung fields appear clear. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An old healed right posterior ninth rib fracture appears unchanged.
