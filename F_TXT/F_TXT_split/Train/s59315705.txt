The endotracheal tube terminates less than 1 cm above the level of the carina, and appears to be heading towards the right mainstem bronchus. Lung volumes are low resulting crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Bilateral perihilar atelectasis is noted. There is no lobar consolidation, large pneumothorax, or pleural effusion identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
