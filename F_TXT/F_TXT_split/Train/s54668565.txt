There has been interval placement of endotracheal tube which courses toward the right mainstem bronchus, low in position and should be withdrawn approximately 5.5 cm for more optimal positioning. Subtle patchy right base opacity is again seen, slightly less conspicuous as compared to the prior study. The left lung is clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
