Loculated moderate left effusion is noted. A small area of radiolucency in the mid left lung medially likely represents a pneumothorax. There is a new left basal pigtail catheter. There is moderate cardiomegaly. Pacer leads are in standard position. Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC, large right pleural effusion has increased with increasing adjacent opacities. These opacities are likely atelectases but superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. There is no right pneumothorax.
