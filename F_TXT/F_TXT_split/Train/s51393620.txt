Malpositioned right internal jugular catheter traversing into the right subclavian vein is unchanged from the most recent exam (tip about 7.5 cm from the origin of the right subclavian vein). Right infrahilar opacity suspected to be pneumonia on the prior exam is not as conspicuous, while still could be present is definitely not worse. The heart is top-normal in size. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is likely. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
