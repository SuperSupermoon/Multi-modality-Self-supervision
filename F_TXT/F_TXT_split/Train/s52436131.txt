AP chest reviewed in the absence of any recent chest imaging: Heart size is normal and pulmonary vasculature unremarkable. Greater opacification at the lung bases, particularly right, could be atelectasis alone, or aspiration. Small right pleural effusion is also present. Followup recommended with conventional chest radiographs when feasible.
