CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 2:50 a.m., there has been some clearing of the collapse and/or consolidation at both right and left lung bases. Some residual opacity remains at both bases. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Mild upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. The ET tube lies approximately 7.8 cm above the carina, at the lower edge of the medial clavicular heads. Right IJ central line tip is obscured, but appears to overlie the mid SVC. Left-sided pacemaker is present, with three leads, unchanged.
