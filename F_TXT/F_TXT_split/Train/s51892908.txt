The ET tube tip is 4.7 cm above the carina. Right Hickman catheter tip is at the right atrium. Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. Bibasilar areas of atelectasis have developed in the interim, most likely related to low lung volumes. Opacity adjacent to the right hilum is noted, new and might reflect area of atelectasis or interval development of infection, attention to this area on the subsequent studies is recommended. No pneumothorax is seen.
