Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates the patient in a very oblique position, making it difficult to evaluate the heart and lungs. The right lung is less visualized on this radiograph, which may be secondary to positioning of the patient. An thoracostomy tube is seen projecting over the right hemithorax.
