Endotracheal tube terminates 4.0 cm above the carina. NG tube terminates below the diaphragm. Left IJ catheter terminates at the mid-to-lower SVC. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable with mild cardiomegaly. Vascular markings at the right lung base are less prominent, compatible with improved vascular congestion. Retrocardiac opacity and blunting of the left costophrenic angle is compatible with small pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
