ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carinal. Left subclavian line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Right middle lower lung consolidations are unchanged as well as left basal opacity although minimal improvement in the left lung base is potentially present. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax appreciated.
