Since the prior radiograph, there has been a substantial decrease in size of the left pleural effusion which is almost completely resolved. There is no pneumothorax. A hazy opacity overlying the right upper lobe is unchanged and most likely represents an infection, although asymmetric edema could be considered. There is no right pleural effusion. A right PICC ends in the low SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and unchanged.
