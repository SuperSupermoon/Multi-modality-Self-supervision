Single AP portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal contours. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Hazy pulmonary vasculature is identified with faint patchy opacities in the perihilar and upper lung zones suggests a mild degree of pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacities likely represent atelectasis, though developing infectious process cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle may reflect a small pleural effusion though this area is not well evaluated due to overlying medical devices. No osseous abnormalities identified.
