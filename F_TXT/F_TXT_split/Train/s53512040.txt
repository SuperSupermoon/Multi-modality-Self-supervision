As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient with a known right pneumothorax has received a right-sided chest tube. Pneumothorax currently has a diameter of approximately 1 cm at the left lung apex, but overall the lung is substantially better inflated and expanded than on the previous image. There is no evidence of tension. Unchanged appearance of the right lung, unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
