Interval placement of nasogastric tube, with the tip terminating in the proximal stomach, but sideport above the GE junction level. This could be advanced several centimeters for standard positioning. The thoracic aorta is tortuous and demonstrates dilatation in the descending region, consistent with known history of aortic aneurysm. Left ventricular configuration of the heart is also demonstrated. Within the lungs, linear foci of atelectasis are present at both lung bases. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, numerous loops of dilated small bowel are present, suggestive of a small-bowel obstruction. Please see separately dictated abdominal radiographs under clip ___for more complete evaluation of the bowel gas pattern.
