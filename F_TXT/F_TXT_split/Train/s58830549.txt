Endotracheal tube tip is 6.4 cm above the carina, orogastric tube ends into the stomach, though its distal end is off radiographic view, and a single right pleural drain tube ending near the apex and two left chest tubes, one ending near the apex and other at left lung base are unchanged. There is a single right-sided lead ending into the right atrium. Bilateral pleural effusions are small and minimal bibasilar opacities, is probably accompanying atelectasis. No new discrete opacities of concern. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Subcutaneous emphysema is minimal and unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
