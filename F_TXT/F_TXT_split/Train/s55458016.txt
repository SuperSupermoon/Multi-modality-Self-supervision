No preoperative image is presented. There are low lung volumes which may account for the mild prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. There is widening of the superior mediastinum, though this most likely reflects a combination of the AP position and the abundant soft tissues of the patient. Pulmonary vascularity is probably within normal limits and there is no definite pneumonia or pleural effusion.
