ET and oro gastric tubes and left-sided pacemaker again noted, similar to the prior study. Allowing for differences in positioning and lower inspiratory volumes, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Prominence of the right hilum again noted, similar to prior. Again seen is vascular plethora and blurring, consistent with CHF grossly similar to prior. Also again seen is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Small bilateral effusions again noted. As before, there is a band of somewhat more confluent opacity the junction of the right mid and lower zones.
