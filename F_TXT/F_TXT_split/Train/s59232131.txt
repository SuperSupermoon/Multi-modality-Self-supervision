There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular catheter. The tip cannot be visualized due to pacemaker leads, but it at least reaches the upper SVC. The endotracheal tube ends 3.6 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube follows the expected course ending below the diaphragm, although the tip is not visualized. There is gaseous distention of the stomach. Left upper lobe and possibly right lung pneumonia is unchanged. There is diffuse osteopenia.
