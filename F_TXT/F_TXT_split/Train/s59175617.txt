New left thoracostomy tubes have been placed, extending from base to apex. There still considerable atelectasis in the left lung and probably some persistent pleural effusion and air, although the distribution has changed. Widening of the upper mediastinum could be due to adjacent pleural fluid, but mediastinal veins are dilated. Small right pleural effusion is new. Heart is still enlarged.
