Allowing for lower lung volumes, which accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures, there has probably not been a substantial short interval relevant change in the appearance of the chest since the recent study of one day earlier. However, a repeat radiograph at a similar lung volume to the prior radiograph may be considered for more accurate comparison if the patient's clinical status has changed in the last 24 hours.
