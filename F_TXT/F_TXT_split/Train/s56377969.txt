Compared to the prior radiograph from noon, there has been interval removal of left chest tube with essentially unchanged degree of left apical pneumothorax, still moderate. Unchanged cardiomediastinal contours and normal appearing right lung. Branching density in the superior segment of the left lower lobe is still present. This could be further evaluated via CT.
