Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy. Slight increase in opacity in the right mid-to-lower lung may relate to patient positioning. However, underlying infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. There may also be minimal overlying vascular congestion. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Evidence of multiple old right-sided rib fractures is seen. Degenerative change at the bilateral shoulder joints.
