The right upper mediastinal contour is bulging (part of this area is imaged on a CT of the cervical spine performed on the same day, suggesting a cystic lesion in the area), not significantly changed although long-term follow-up is not available. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. The lung fields appear clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
