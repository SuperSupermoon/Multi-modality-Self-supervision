There has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube terminating in the very proximal stomach with weighted portion at the proximal stomach/gastroesophageal junction. There are low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. Previously questioned opacity at the left costophrenic angle is less apparent on the current study and may have related to overlying soft tissue.
