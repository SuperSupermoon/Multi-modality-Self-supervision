The heart is top normal in size. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. Prominence of the hila bilaterally is unchanged. Low lung volumes are present which result in crowding of the bronchovascular vascular structures. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion may be present. Streaky bibasilar opacities are nonspecific and could reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Ossific density within the right acromiohumeral interval may reflect a loose body.
