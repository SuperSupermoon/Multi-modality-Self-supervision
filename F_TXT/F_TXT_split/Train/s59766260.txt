Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis. A dual lead pacemaker is in-situ, a right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. Calcific densities projecting over the right apex are likely due to apical pleural scarring. No pneumothorax seen. Atrophic remodeling of the bilateral proximal humeri is likely related to the superior subluxation of the glenohumeral joints.
