Portable semi-erect chest radiograph demonstrate persistent low lung volumes. There is moderate pulmonary edema with left lower lung opacification, new since prior chest radiograph dated 1 day prior. This may represent atelectasis versus superimposed pneumonia. The endotracheal tube is not well seen and may be obscured by the chin. There is subcutaneous emphysema in the right supraclavicular region with no evidence of mediastinal air. A right IJ is seen at the cavoatrial junction. A left chest tube projects to the level of the aortic arch. Extensive abdominal free air is noted. Known and unchanged cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax.
