Comparison is made to previous study from ___ at 4:12 a.m. There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 1.7 cm above the carina. This could be pulled back for more optimal placement by 2 cm. There is a nasogastric tube whose tip and side port are below the GE junction. The heart size is within normal limits. There are bilateral pleural effusions and a left retrocardiac opacity and some mild pulmonary interstitial edema. There is also a left-sided central line with the distal tip in the left brachiocephalic vein projecting over the aortic knob. This is unchanged in position from the prior study. No pneumothoraces are present.
