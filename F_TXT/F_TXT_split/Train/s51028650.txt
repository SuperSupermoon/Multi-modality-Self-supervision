An ET tube is present, tip 3.8 cm above the carina. At present, the trachea appears midline. A right IJ central line tip overlies the mid/ distal SVC. There are low inspiratory volumes. There is moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly. Prominence of the mediastinum is noted, in keeping with findings on the prior film and likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Mild left greater right apical pleural thickening is unchanged. The apices are otherwise clear. There is slight upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, suggesting mild interstitial edema. There is patchy opacity at the left lung base and the possibility of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation cannot be excluded. The bulk of the left hemidiaphragm remains visible. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, but no gross effusion. Minimal atelectasis at the right base. Metallic density overlying the right side of the lumbar spine is consistent with known IVC filter, it incompletely evaluated on this study.
