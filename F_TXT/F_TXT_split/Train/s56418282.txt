As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have substantially decreased, likely due to a lesser inspiratory effort. Subsequent crowding of the vascular structures, but mild fluid overload might be present. No overt pulmonary edema. Atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases. No larger pleural effusions.
