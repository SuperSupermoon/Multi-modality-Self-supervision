The endotracheal tube ends 4.1 cm above the carina. Nasoenteric tube extends to the stomach with the tip out of view. Today there are symmetric bibasilar consolidations, previously only on the left, but now at both lung bases. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable with decreased mediastinal vascular congestion and no substantial pleural effusions. The progression of the lung abnormality in the setting of improving cardiac function suggests that the consolidation is not due to cardiogenic edema, but is concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
