Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is obscuration of the bilateral diaphragms worrisome for pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not entirely excluded. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. No definite evidence of pneumothorax is seen. There is central pulmonary vascular engorgement. The cardiac silhouette is not optimally assessed due to the bibasilar opacities, although appears mildly enlarged. The mediastinum is not widened. The aortic knob calcification is seen. Chronic deformity at the right shoulder/proximal humerus is again seen.
