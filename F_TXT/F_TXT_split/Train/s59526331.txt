Interval placement of a right pleural catheter, a right pleural effusion has substantially decreased in size with a residual moderate, loculated effusion remaining. A hydropneumothorax component is present superiorly. There is associated improved aeration of the right lung, with a residual mass-like opacity in the right juxtahilar region, which may be due to a combination of post-treatment change and possibly residual or recurrent tumor, difficult to assess on a portable radiograph. Within the left lung, linear atelectasis is present in the mid lung region. There is no evidence of left pleural effusion.
