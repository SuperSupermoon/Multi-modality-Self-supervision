Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Perihilar edema appears similar on the left allowing for differences in technique between the studies, but there is an increasing area of confluent opacity in the right ___- and infrahilar regions. It is uncertain whether this represents asymmetrical edema or a secondary process such as infectious pneumonia. Moderate to large right pleural effusion has also increased in size. Small left pleural effusion appears similar as well as a patchy area of atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region.
