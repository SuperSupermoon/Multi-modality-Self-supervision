As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are constant. The extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, notably at the level of the left lung apex, and, to a milder degree, at the right lung apex, are constant. Due to projection effects, the right costophrenic sinus appears to be blunted but there is no evidence of a larger pleural effusion. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette persists.
