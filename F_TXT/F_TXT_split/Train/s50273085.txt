1. Endotracheal tube unchanged in position. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal right atrium, unchanged.

Improvement in mild pulmonary edema with residual mild interstitial edema. Persistent low lung volumes. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the patient rotation on the current examination.
