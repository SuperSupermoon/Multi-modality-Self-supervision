There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates just distal to the clavicles. The patient has had median sternotomy with CABG. A left pectoral AICD remains in place. A newly placed Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the right descending pulmonary artery. Retained pacer leads are in place. There is no pneumothorax. Marked cardiomegaly is unchanged. Bilateral airspace opacities are slightly improved. New retrocardiac airspace opacification is likely due to atelectasis. Extensive splenic artery calcifications are incidentally noted.
