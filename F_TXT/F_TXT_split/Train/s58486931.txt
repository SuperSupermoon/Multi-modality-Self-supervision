In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is extensive respiratory motion that degrades the image. Apparent increase in opacification in the left mid and lower lung zones is worrisome for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Volume loss in the left lower lobe with pleural effusion is probably present. Although the pulmonary vessels are not optimally seen, there is evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
