Overall no significant interval change from the prior exam. The patient is rotated. The ETT tip ends approximately 5 cm from the carina. The right subclavian PICC line ends in the mid SVC. The left pigtail drain projects over the lower left hemithorax. Bilateral left greater right pleural effusions are unchanged. Lung volumes remain low. Opacification of the left lower hemithorax with slight leftward shift despite coexisting pleural effusion suggests substantial atelectasis, overall similar. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No pneumothorax. Opacities in the right hemithorax suggest pulmonary vascular congestion. Right pulmonary edema has since decreased.
