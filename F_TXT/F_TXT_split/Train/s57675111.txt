Intra-aortic balloon pump has been repositioned, with tip now terminating about 3.4 cm below the expected location of the superior aspect of the aortic knob, in the region of the aorticopulmonary window. Endotracheal tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, nasogastric tube, and vascular sheath are unchanged in position. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and is accompanied by improving asymmetric perihilar edema, worse on the right than the left. Moderate right pleural effusion tracking to the apex is also slightly decreased in size in the interval. Questionable layering left pleural effusion.
