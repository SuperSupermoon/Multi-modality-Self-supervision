The cardiac silhouette size is normal and unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Biapical opacities are again noted, with streaky left basilar opacity likely reflective of atelectasis. There may be a trace left pleural effusion as there is blunting of the left costophrenic angle. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema is demonstrated. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
