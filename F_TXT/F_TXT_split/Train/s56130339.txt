Despite the presence of a left basilar chest tube, the large left pleural effusion has increased, and now contributes to near complete opacification of the left hemithorax. Given the lack of appreciable mediastinal shift, there is also likely increased ipsilateral atelectasis. The right lung remains clear. There is no pneumothorax. Metallic clips in the right upper quadrant indicate prior cholecystectomy.
