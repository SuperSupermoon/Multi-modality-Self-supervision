Left-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen with catheter terminating in the low SVC, without evidence of pneumothorax. There is a moderate left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded. The right lung is clear. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given that the left heart border is not fully evaluated given the left base opacity.
