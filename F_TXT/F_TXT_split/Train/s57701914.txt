A single frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Heterogeneous opacity at the right lung base may represent pneumonia or aspiration. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged and the azygous vein is larger. The cardiac silhouette is larger than on the prior study. Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. There is no free air under the diaphragm.
