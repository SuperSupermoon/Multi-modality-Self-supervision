As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube now projects 5.8 cm above the carina with its tip. The position of a left PICC line and of the nasogastric tube are constant. Lung volumes are unchanged. Blunting of the right costophrenic sinus suggests the presence of a small pleural effusion. Also is a left basal retrocardiac atelectasis that is overall unchanged in an area of increased parenchymal opacity in the left basolateral lung. The changes might be infectious in origin and are constant since the previous examination. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Normal hilar and mediastinal contours. An abdominal drain projects over the right upper quadrant. No pneumothorax.
