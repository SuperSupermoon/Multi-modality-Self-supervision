As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are constant. Although the lung volumes remain low, they have improved as compared to the previous examination, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. The patient continues to show signs of mild-to-moderate fluid overload, the presence of a small left pleural effusion with subsequent areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung base are likely. No evidence of interval appearance of new parenchymal opacities.
