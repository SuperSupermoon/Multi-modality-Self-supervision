Single portable AP chest radiograph is provided. Since the prior radiograph, there has been no significant interval change given differences in technique. Prominent interstitial markings as well as opacities in the right perihilar region again seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable given the portable AP projection. Again seen is apical pleural thickening on the left, unchanged from the prior exam. There is scoliosis of the spine.
