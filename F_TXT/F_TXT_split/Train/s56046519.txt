1. Large left and moderate right effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion suggest moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. 2. Asymmetric opacity in the central left upper lobe has somewhat of a "butterfly" appearance of pulmonary edema. However, given the unilateral distribution, the presence of an additional consolidation or mass is likely. Repeat radiographs should be taken after diuresis. Cross sectional imaging may be considered at that point if the diagnosis remains in doubt.
