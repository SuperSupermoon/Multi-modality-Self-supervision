In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Relatively low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle represents either small effusion or more likely pleural thickening. Retrocardiac opacification again most likely represents atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in this region, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
