AP chest compared to 11:28 a.m. on ___: Nasogastric tube is looped in the mid esophagus and needs to be re-positioned. Moderately severe pulmonary edema may have worsened slightly, but most of the interim changes probably due to an increase in volume of moderate right and somewhat smaller left pleural effusion. Left lower lobe collapse and moderate cardiomegaly is stable. No pneumothorax. Right PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
