Newly placed or newly visible endotracheal tube ends just above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 7 cm from the carina and should be advanced 3 cm for optimal placement. Left lower lobe consolidation with volume loss, indicating a component of collapse, is new. A very small amount of air highlighting the left mediastinal border from the aortic arch to the left atrial appendage, is probably pneumomediastinum. This may be a function of positive pressure ventilation. Clinical monitoring is advised prior to any additional imaging, especially because the subsequent chest radiograph available the time of this review, 05:46 on ___, shows no progression of pneumomediastinum. Feeding tube ends in the region of the pylorus. Right upper lung is clear. Right lower lung may be shadowing early consolidation. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
