AP chest compared to 8:16 p.m.: Lateral aspect right hemithorax excluded from the examination, does not warrant repeat study following chest radiograph less than an hour before. Tip of the endotracheal tube has been advanced, ending 4 cm above the carina in standard placement. Moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, mild edema, and bibasilar atelectasis are stable. Left internal jugular line ends at the origin of SVC, and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. A small left pleural effusion is presumed. No evidence of pneumothorax.
