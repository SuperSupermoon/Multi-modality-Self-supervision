Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Elevation of right hemidiaphragm with indistinctness of the lateral third of the diaphragm contour could potentially be due to pleural and parenchymal scarring given the presence of a loculated pleural effusion in this region on the older radiograph. A small chronic right pleural effusion cannot be excluded, and standard PA and lateral radiographs may be helpful for more complete assessment prior to discharge. Lungs and pleural surfaces are otherwise clear.
