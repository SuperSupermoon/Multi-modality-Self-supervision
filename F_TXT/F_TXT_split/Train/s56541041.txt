Single frontal view of the chest was provided. As compared with multiple prior exams, the appearance of the chest is stable with vague basilar opacities, likely representing scarring or atelectasis. The possibility of pneumonia is difficult to exclude though given the stability over time, chronic scarring or atelectasis is favored. No large effusion is seen, though the CP angles are partially excluded bilaterally. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinal contour normal. Tracheobronchial tree calcification noted. Clips to the right of the upper trachea in the superior mediastinum are likely from prior thyroid resection. Bony structures are intact.
