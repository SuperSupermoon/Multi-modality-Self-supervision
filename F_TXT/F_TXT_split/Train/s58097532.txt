1. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube with its tip projecting over the stomach. There are diffuse bony metastases. There is bilateral patchy airspace process with probable associated pleural effusions, right greater than left, which is likely not significantly changed given differences in technique between studies. The left costophrenic angle is not entirely included on this film. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning.
