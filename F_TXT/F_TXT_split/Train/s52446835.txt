AP chest compared to ___ at 4:55 p.m.: There is new mild upper vascular engorgement, and heterogeneous opacification at the base of the left lung accompanied by some volume loss. Findings are difficult to explain with one diagnosis, perhaps aspiration and developing consolidation in the left lower lobe and early cardiac decompensation. Heart size is normal. Pleural effusion is small if any. ET tube is in standard placement. Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
