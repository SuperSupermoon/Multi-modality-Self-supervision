Low bilateral lung volumes. Bibasilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax identified. The size and appearance of the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Minimal lucency along the medial right hemidiaphragm equivocal for tiny amount of residual intraperitoneal air versus basal pulmonary air delineated by adjacent atelectasis.
