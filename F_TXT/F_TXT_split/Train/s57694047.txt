In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again increased opacification in the right upper lobe with associated volume loss. Clearing of this pneumonia should be documented on subsequent images to exclude a central obstructing lesion. There has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends at least to the upper stomach, or crosses the lower margin of the image. Remainder the study is unchanged.
