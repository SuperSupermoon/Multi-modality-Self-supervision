As compared to previous radiograph from less than 2 hr earlier, the the bronchus intermedius and distal right main bronchus are better visualized, likely reflecting removal of secretions at recent bronchoscopy procedure. Right middle lobe and right lower lobe are slightly better aerated but remain substantially atelectatic in this patient who is status post a recent right upper lobe resection. Large right pneumothorax is again demonstrated with indwelling chest tube, as well as a small right pleural effusion and subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall.
