Two frontal images of the chest again demonstrate significant volume loss in the right pulmonary apex and thickened pleura. This could represent remote TB infection but is also concerning for a new neoplastic process. There is also some right upper lobe atelectasis and a small pleural effusion in the major fissure on the right. There are no major changes to the bilateral pleural effusions. Chest tube is seen again in place on the right. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
