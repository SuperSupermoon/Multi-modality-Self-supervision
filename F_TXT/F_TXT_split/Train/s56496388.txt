As compared to prior chest radiograph, lung volumes are decreased causing crowding at the lung bases. Overall, there appears to be interval progression of pulmonary opacities, most prominent at the periphery of the lungs bilaterally. Given the short interval time frame between both studies, findings are concerning for an overlying infectious process. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited. A right-sided Port-A-Cath catheter remains in unchanged position. There is no pneumothorax.
