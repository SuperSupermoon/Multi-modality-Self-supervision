An endotracheal tube is in unchanged position, 5.3 cm from the carina. A right internal jugular sheath is present with the tip in the upper SVC. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip in the stomach. Since the prior exam, moderate right and small left pleural effusion appear grossly stable. There is no new opacity or pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Left-sided rib fractures are again noted.
