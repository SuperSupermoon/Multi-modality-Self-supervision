AP chest compared to ___: Mild interstitial edema and congestion of pulmonary vessels and mediastinal veins are new. Greater opacification at the lung bases is probably a combination of dependent edema and atelectasis, but I cannot exclude infection. Transvenous pacer lead ends in the region of the right ventricular apex. Pleural effusion, if present, is small. No pneumothorax.
