Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Dialysis catheter is seen, terminating at the cavoatrial junction. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Right paratracheal calcification is again seen. There is mild vascular congestion. Patchy left base opacity may represent atelectasis and vascular congestion, although underlying consolidation not excluded. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.
