Endotracheal tube and other indwelling devices remain in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Pulmonary vascular congestion has slightly improved, and bilateral partially layering pleural effusions have apparently decreased in size, although differences in positioning could contribute to this apparent change. Adjacent basilar atelectasis is again demonstrated.
