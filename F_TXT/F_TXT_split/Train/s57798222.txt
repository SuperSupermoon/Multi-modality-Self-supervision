1. Interval appearance of linear opacity at the left lung base as well as streaky opacities in the right lung base, favoring atelectasis rather than an early infectious process. Possible small right pleural effusion. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Right-sided Port-A-Cath remains in place. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. An intramedullary rod with screws is seen in the incompletely visualized proximal humerus. No acute bony abnormality is appreciated.
