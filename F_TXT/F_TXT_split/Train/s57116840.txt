Following placement of a right pigtail pleural catheter, a small right apical pneumothorax has developed. The amount of pleural fluid has decreased, with residual small-to-moderate right pleural effusion remaining. Extensive airspace disease is present in the right mid and lower lungs and could reflect an underlying pneumonic consolidation in this region. Alternatively, reexpansion pulmonary edema could contribute to this appearance. Left retrocardiac opacity has worsened in the interval and likely represents atelectasis. Moderate left pleural effusion is not appreciably changed.
