Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement suggesting volume overload, without overt pulmonary edema.
