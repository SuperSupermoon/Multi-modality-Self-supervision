AP chest compared to 10:48 a.m.: Left jugular Swan-Ganz catheter has been withdrawn to the proximal descending right pulmonary artery, standard placement. Dual-channel right internal jugular catheter ends in the mid SVC. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube ends in the lower third of the esophagus and would need to be advanced at least 15 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. It may be positioned as high because it is looped in the hypopharynx. A loop of tubing in that location is not entirely convincing as the more proximal nasogastric tube, but this is easily evaluated by clinical inspection. Lung volumes remain exceedingly low, but it appears that mild pulmonary edema has improved. Heart is top-normal size, slightly larger than earlier in the day, as is the caliber of the mediastinum suggesting increased intravascular volume. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. These findings were discussed by telephone with the patient's nurse at 2:30 p.m. when the findings were recognized.
