Unchanged alignment of the clips, the valvular replacement and the sternal wires. Minimal increase in extent of the pre-existing pleural effusions. The cardiac silhouette however has not changed in size. The with of the mediastinum has returned for normal. There is no evidence of mediastinal widening and no evidence of an increase in mediastinal radiodensity or the appearance of unexpected mediastinal contours. No pneumothorax.
