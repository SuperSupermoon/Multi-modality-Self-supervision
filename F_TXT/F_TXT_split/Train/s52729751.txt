PA and lateral chest compared to ___: There has been substantial improvement in asymmetric pulmonary consolidation suggesting that it is probably largely pulmonary edema in the upper lungs. The right lower lobe is clearing a region of consolidation much more slowly, and this might be a pneumonia responding to treatment. Small right pleural effusion is stable. There is no appreciable pleural effusion on the left. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. There are multiple bilateral rib fractures in various stages of healing, but no pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends low in the SVC.
