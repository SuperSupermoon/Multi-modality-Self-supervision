In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased bilateral pulmonary opacifications. The appearance could well reflect increasing pulmonary edema that is slightly asymmetric with a preponderance on the right. The right hemidiaphragm is not as sharp, suggesting some increasing pleural effusion on this side. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia or aspiration, especially on the right, would be difficult to exclude.
