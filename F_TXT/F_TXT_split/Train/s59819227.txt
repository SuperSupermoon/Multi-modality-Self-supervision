The study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. Patchy ill-defined opacities in the lung bases appear slightly progressed when compared to the prior study. This could reflect atelectasis as a result of slightly reduced lung volumes compared to the prior study. Additionally, more focal patchy opacity in the right lung base again may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema or infection. There are continued small bilateral pleural effusions as well as a loculated right apicolateral pleural effusion. Remainder of the exam is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. No evidence of pneumothorax. The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, pacemaker placement, and left axillary lymph node dissection.
