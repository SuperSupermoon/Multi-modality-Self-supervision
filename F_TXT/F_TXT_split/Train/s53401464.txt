An endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 1 cm above the level of the carina. Recommend withdrawal by approximately 2 cm for more optimal positioning. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm; however, the side port appears to be in the level of the distal esophagus. Distal aspect of the feeding tube is in the expected location of the proximal stomach. Recommend advancement so that it is well within the stomach. Left base retrocardiac opacity is seen, which may be due to a combination of atelectasis, consolidation, possibly from aspiration or infection. Right basilar opacity is seen to a lesser extent, which may be due to atelectasis. Trace pleural effusions are difficult to exclude. Overall, there are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. There is prominence of the hila which may relate to pulmonary vascular engorgement and which are likely somewhat accentuated by low lung volumes. Above findings regarding the location of the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes were discussed with Dr. ___ on ___ at 6:19 p.m. via telephone.
