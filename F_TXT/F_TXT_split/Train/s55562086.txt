As compared to the previous radiograph, a small-bore catheter is now visible on the left and projects over the region of the left costophrenic sinus. The sinus is blunted by a small amount of pleural effusion. However, the effusion is not substantial. Areas of basal atelectasis. Clips projecting over the left thoracic inlet. No pneumothorax. No other relevant changes.
