Support and monitoring devices are similar in position except for removal of Swan-Ganz catheter and slight repositioning of nasogastric tube coursing cephalad in the fundus. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance, and there is persistent pulmonary vascular congestion. Moderate left pleural effusion has apparently increased in size and is associated with worsening opacities in the left mid and lower lung region. Right basilar opacification and small right pleural effusion are similar.
