Interval reduction in extent of right mediastinal and hilar widening, suggestive of response of known lymphoma to interval therapy. Right upper lobe consolidation and atelectasis have partially cleared with residual peripheral opacification and subtle perihilar opacification remaining. Remainder of lungs are grossly clear, and there is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
