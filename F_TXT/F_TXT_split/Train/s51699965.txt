Interval extubation. Slight decrease in cardiac enlargement, but persistent pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema. Heterogeneous opacities in right lung persist and are likely due to a multifocal pneumonia. Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with a persistent to slightly increased loculated small lateral right pneumothorax, as well as a small dependent persistent pleural effusion.
