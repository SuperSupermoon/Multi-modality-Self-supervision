An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2.8 cm above the carina. Enteric type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A PICC line is present, tip overlying the upper right atrium. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged cannot the aortic knob is obscured, with surrounding soft tissue density, unchanged. There bilateral effusions, with layering, resulting in hazy density in the lower lungs, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. The right effusion may be slightly larger. Artifact overlies the upper right lung laterally, obscuring underlying parenchyma. There is probable mild upper zone redistribution. No obvious pneumothorax. Mild enlargement of the azygous vein (12 mm) suggests right-sided engorgement .
