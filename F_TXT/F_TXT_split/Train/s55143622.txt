Technique is limited due to underpenetration and positioning. Allowing for this limitation, there is no significant change from prioor exams, with stable moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral layering effusions, right worse than left. No pneumothorax. An ICD projects over the upper left hemithorax with a single lead in the right ventricle, unchanged from prior.
