As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in extent and severity of the known bilateral parenchymal opacities, predominating in the subpleural lung zones, with a focus of increased severity at the left lung bases. Given the short interval, the change is likely reflect pulmonary edema overlying pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis. The lung volumes remain low. Mild cardiomegaly.
