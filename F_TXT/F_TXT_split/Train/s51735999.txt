The IJ line has been removed. The right-sided PICC line is still in place. The tip is difficult to visualize on today's study, but is at least in the superior vena cava. There is a moderate left effusion and a tiny right effusion. There is volume loss in both lower lobes. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution and moderate cardiomegaly. Compared to the prior study, the effusion on the left is slightly larger and the volume loss on the right has increased.
