Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Increasing peribronchial opacities throughout the left lung likely represent fluid overload. There is probable increase in small left effusion. NG tube tip is in the stomach. The side port is at the GE junction and should be advanced at least 5 cm for a more standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the low SVC/cavoatrial junction. Right chest tube remains in unchanged position. The appearance of the right chest is unchanged with mass-like consolidations in the right upper and right lower lobes and dense peribronchial opacities in the perihilar region.
