The lungs are well inflated and clear. No nodule, consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax is present. The heart and mediastinal contour are normal. There are two linear lucent lines at the edge of the left pulmonary artery contour may correspond to previously seen pneumomediastinum. Evaluation is limited on a single frontal projection.
