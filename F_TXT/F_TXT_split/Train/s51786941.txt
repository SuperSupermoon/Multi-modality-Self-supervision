Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are larger. No pneumothorax. Heart size normal. Right basal atelectasis has increased. There may have been 1 or 2 small, new focal lesions at the base of the left lung, projecting over the left fifth rib anteriorly, developed between ___ and ___. I cannot be sure whether it does lesions were real, and if they are still present, but when pleural effusions resolved, conventional chest radiograph should be obtained to look for them.
