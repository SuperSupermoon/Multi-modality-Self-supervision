Compared with ___ at ___:47, there is opacity along the right chest wall, slightly increased. On today's exam, there is equivocal irregularity involving at least 1 rib along the lower right chest, as well as a defect in the posterior sixth rib that likely relates to the recent surgery. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is the NG type tube extending along the right mediastinum. Additional linear density likely reflects an epidural catheter. A right-sided chest tube is also present, unchanged. There is mild vascular plethora without frank CHF. Patchy opacity at the left base medially is again noted, possibly slightly increased. Patchy opacity at the right base is similar to the prior film. No gross effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
