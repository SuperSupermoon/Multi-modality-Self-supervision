As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a marked improvement of the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities. However, the opacities are still clearly seen, and, as underlined by the diameter of the vascular structures, likely representing pulmonary edema. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged position of the monitoring and support devices. No evidence of larger pleural effusions.
