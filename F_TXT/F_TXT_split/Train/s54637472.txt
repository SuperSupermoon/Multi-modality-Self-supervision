Moderate right pneumothorax unchanged in size since ___ despite indwelling pleural drainage tube. The oblique orientation of the tube raises question about fissural placement. Lateral view would be helpful in making that determination. The volume of subcutaneous air in the right chest has increased, sometimes an indication of thoracostomy tube malfunction. Consolidation in the right lower lung is long-standing. Whether this is pneumonia, atelectasis, or hemorrhage is radiographically indeterminate. Subsegmental atelectasis at the left lung base has worsened. Heart size is normal. There is no pulmonary edema in the left and no left pleural abnormality.
