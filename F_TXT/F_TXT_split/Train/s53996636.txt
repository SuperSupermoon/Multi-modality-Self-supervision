Pulmonary edema has markedly improved. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube is in standard position. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the upper to mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Pleural plaques are again noted. Increasing opacity in the right mid lung could be atelectasis or pneumonia, attention in followup studies is recommended. Bilateral pleural effusions larger on the right side likely stable allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.
