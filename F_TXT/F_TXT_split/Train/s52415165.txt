Frontal radiograph of the chest shows unchanged right internal jugular and left PICC lines. The right internal jugular central venous catheter persists in the high right atrium. Compared to prior radiograph, the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pleural effusions. The opacity that was seen at the left base has improved in the interim and was likely atelectasis. There is no acute consolidation.
