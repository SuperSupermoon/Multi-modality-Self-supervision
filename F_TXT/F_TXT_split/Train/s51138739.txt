In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The appearance of the previous nasogastric tube, since withdrawn, suggests a large hiatal hernia or intrathoracic stomach. Adjacent to this opacification there is an area of increased opacification at the right base laterally. In view of the clinical setting, this could reflect an area of aspiration. The remainder of the lungs is essentially clear and there is no evidence of vascular congestion.
