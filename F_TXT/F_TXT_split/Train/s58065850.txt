Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Abandoned pacer lead with tip in the right atrium is in unchanged position. Small-to-moderate right and small left pleural effusions associated with adjacent opacities and tracking through the fissures are unchanged. Right middle lobe and lingular opacities have minimally increased, likely worsening multifocal pneumonia. Opacity in the right mid lung is fluid in the fissure. Of note, the lower aspects of the hemithorax were not included on the film.
