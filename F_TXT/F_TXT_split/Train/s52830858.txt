2 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. There are relatively low lung volumes. Some patient motion is seen to the lower right hemi thorax. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissues, but a trace pleural effusion is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen.
