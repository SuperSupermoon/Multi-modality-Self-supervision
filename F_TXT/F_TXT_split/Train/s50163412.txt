The lung volumes are low. There has been interval development of a dense, retrocardiac opacity which silhouettes the descending aorta, concerning for left lower lobe consolidation. Redemonstrated is a persistent opacity within the right middle lobe, unchanged since ___, which may represent a focus of infection versus focal atelectasis. Small, bilateral pleural effusions are noted again. There is no pneumothorax. The heart appears mildly enlarged, although this may be exaggerated by the AP projection and retrocardiac airspace disease. Median sternotomy wires appear intact and well aligned. No acute bony abnormality is detected.
