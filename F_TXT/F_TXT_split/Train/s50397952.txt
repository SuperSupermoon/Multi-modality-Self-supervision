Single frontal view of the chest. Two leads of a left chest wall pacer terminate in stable position in the right atrium and ventricle. An oblong density overlying the mid-heart to the left of the spine may be artifactual but a hiatal hernia or aortic calcification could have a similar appearance. Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal contours are stable. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
