AP chest compared to ___: Heterogeneous opacification in the left lower lobe is most readily explained by aspiration pneumonia. More uniform opacification in the right lower chest could be moderate right pleural effusion or even right lower lobe atelectasis. Upright radiographs would be helpful in distinguishing between these possibilities. ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements and the upper enteric drainage tube coiled in the stomach. No pneumothorax. Heart size normal.
