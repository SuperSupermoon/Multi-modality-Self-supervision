No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is detected on this single frontal view. Linear opacity in the right lung base is unchanged, suggestive of linear atelectasis or scarring. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Cardiac pacing wires are similarly positioned compared to prior on this frontal view only. Widening of the left acromioclavicular joint is chronic, with chronic degenerative change.
