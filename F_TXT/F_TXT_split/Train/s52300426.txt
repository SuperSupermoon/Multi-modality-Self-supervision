A supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval repositioning of the endotracheal tube, which still terminates to low, roughly at the carina an should be withdrawn 2-3 cm. There is improved aeration of the left lung, with persistent atelectasis. Right base consolidation is slightly more pronounced, concerning for developing pneumonia. The remainder of the exam is similar appearance, with a right internal jugular catheter terminating in the mid to distal SVC, a stimulator device projecting over the left chest wall, and a nasoenteric tube extending beyond the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image.
