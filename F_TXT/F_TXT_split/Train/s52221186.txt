AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made to the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. The patient has undergone left-sided anterior thoracotomy and pericardial window creation. A transverse running row of cutaneous surgical clips overlying the left upper abdominal quadrant indicating the entrance for the left-sided thoracotomy. One chest tube in this area terminates in the lower left-sided pleural space. The second tube has a course which suggests its placement within the pericardial space. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. In the right hemithorax, a diffuse hazy density has developed obliterating the right-sided diaphragmatic contours and reaching along the lateral chest wall. This is compatible with pleural effusion layering in the posterior depending portions of the right-sided pleural space. A circular translucency overlying the right lung base compatible with a loculated air bubble top of the thorax as the patient in steep recumbent, almost supine position. Referring physician, ___. ___, was paged at 4:30 p.m. Situation was discussed with Dr. ___ ___ confirmed that pericardium was evacuated from bloody content and that pleural effusions were present at the time of the operation. Confirmed that the patient was in practically supine position at the time of the radiograph.
