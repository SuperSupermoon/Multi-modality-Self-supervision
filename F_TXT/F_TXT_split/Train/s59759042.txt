Again noted are prominent interstitial markings with indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature, minimally increased in comparison to the prior study. There is blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles suggestive of small bilateral pleural effusions. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated. The aorta is tortuous and has calcifications at the arch. No acute fractures are identified.
