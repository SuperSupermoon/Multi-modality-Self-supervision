Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.7 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses into the stomach with tip off the inferior borders of the film. An additional catheter is noted projecting over the midline and terminating at the region of the T1 vertebral body. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is unfolded. Widening of the superior mediastinum may also be accounted for by low lung volumes and supine technique. There is mild pulmonary edema with upper zone vascular redistribution and vascular indistinctness. More focal opacities in the lung bases and right upper lobe may reflect areas of atelectasis but aspiration or infection is not excluded. No large pneumothorax or pleural effusion on this supine exam. No displaced fractures are visualized. Fixation plates and screws are seen within the lower cervical spine.
