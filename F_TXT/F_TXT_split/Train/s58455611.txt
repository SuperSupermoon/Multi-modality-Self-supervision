The ETT is appropriately positioned approximately 4.2 cm above the carina. There is a right IJ catheter, which likely terminates within the right atrium. There is an NG tube, which courses below the diaphragm, however the tip is not visualized on this image. There is complete silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm, likely representing left lower lobe collapse, however superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, which may be projectional. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
