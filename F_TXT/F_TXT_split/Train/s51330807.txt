As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Moderate cardiomegaly, minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially representing a small left pleural effusion. Retrocardiac atelectasis. Signs of mild overinflation with non-characteristic scarring in the right upper lobe. No pulmonary edema. Clips in the cervical region, presumably after surgery.
