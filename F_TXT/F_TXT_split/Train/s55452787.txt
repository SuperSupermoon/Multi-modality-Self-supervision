1. A pacer remains in place. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at thoracic inlet. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Heart remains stably enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. Hilar contours are prominent and when correlated with the recent CT likely reflects a combination of hilar lymphadenopathy and pulmonary artery hypertension. Improved aeration at the left base suggesting resolving atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax, although sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-erect technique.
