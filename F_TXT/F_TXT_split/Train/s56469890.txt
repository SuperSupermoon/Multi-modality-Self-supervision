Endotracheal tube ends above the upper margin of the clavicles no less than 7 cm from the carina and should be advanced 3 cm for more secure seating. The cuff is now inflated in the larynx. Nasogastric drainage tube ends in nondistended stomach. Right internal jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. Left PIC line ends in the upper right atrium and would need to be withdrawn 4 cm to reposition it in the low SVC, if desired. There is no pneumothorax. Lung volumes are extremely low, making it difficult to determine whether bibasilar consolidation is due to pneumonia or atelectasis. Borderline interstitial pulmonary edema is stable. No pneumothorax.
