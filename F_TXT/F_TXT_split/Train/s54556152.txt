Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Stable bibasilar opacities are present, likely secondary to atelectasis or aspiration. Small left-sided pleural effusion is stable. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Endotracheal tube ends 2.7 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach with the last side port below the GE junction. Pneumoperitoneum resolved. Right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
