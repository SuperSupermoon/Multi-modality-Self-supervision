A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes and a mildly enlarged heart. Diffuse bilateral opacities are consistent with severe pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion is seen, though difficult to evaluate given overlying opacity. There is no pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
