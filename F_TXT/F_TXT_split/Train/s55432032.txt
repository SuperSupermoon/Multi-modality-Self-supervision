Since the recent radiograph from earlier today, an endotracheal tube is been advanced, now terminating 7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube has also been advanced, but side port is still proximal to the GE junction level. Exam is otherwise remarkable for new heterogeneous opacities in the right lower lobe, potentially due to acute aspiration event and less likely asymmetrical edema.
