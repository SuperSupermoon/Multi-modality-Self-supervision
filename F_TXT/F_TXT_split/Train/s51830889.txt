Severe cardiomegaly is chronic, but the lungs are generally clear, pulmonary vasculature, and mediastinal veins are normal and there is no pleural effusion. Mild atelectasis at the right base is unchanged. Severe resorptive and erosive changes both shoulders are long-standing. The right humeral head has been entirely resorbed and is severely subluxed, if not dislocated. Clinical correlation advised.
