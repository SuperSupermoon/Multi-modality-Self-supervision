Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increased opacification of the bilateral bases extending to the mid lungs, consistent with pulmonary edema, but underlying infection cannot be excluded. There are small bilateral pleural effusions which have increased slightly in size as compared to the prior study. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
