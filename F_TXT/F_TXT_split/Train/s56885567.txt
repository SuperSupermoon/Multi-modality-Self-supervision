There is an opacity in the right upper lobe, a portion of which is wedge shaped and grossly similar to the recent CT on ___, accounting for differences in technique. However, more superiorly near the apex, there is also increasing hazy alveolar opacities. This is new from the preoperative chest radiograph on ___, and therefore unclear whether this represents worsening airspace disease or a component of post biopsy hemorrhage. The remainder of the lungs are otherwise similar compared to ___. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is top-normal.
