No prior study is available for direct comparison. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 3.8 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. There is a nasogastric tube whose distal tip and side port are below the GE junction and within the body of the stomach. Heart size is within normal limits. There is some prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. There is some patchy opacity at the left base which may represent atelectasis or developing infiltrate. Followup to resolution is recommended. There are no pneumothoraces.
