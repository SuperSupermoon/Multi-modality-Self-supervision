Previous moderate pulmonary edema has nearly resolved. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly little changed. Left PIC line ends in the upper right atrium, at a level 7.5 cm below the carina and should be withdrawn to cm to reposition it in the low SVC if desired. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
