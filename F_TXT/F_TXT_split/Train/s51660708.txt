There is no pneumothorax. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and right apical radiation fibrosis changes are stable. There may be an increased small right pleural effusion. Aeration of the residual right lung is decreased, with worsening opacification, which might be attributed to decreased lung volumes compared with the prior study. Asymmetric pulmonary edema or superimposed pneumonia are possible in the proper clinical setting. The right apical small collection of air and fluid is unchanged.
