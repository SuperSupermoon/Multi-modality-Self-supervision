A right-sided PICC line is again seen with the tip terminating in the right axilla unchanged from prior chest radiographs. The PICC needs to be repositioned for proper placement in the low SVC. Mild pulmonary edema has improved from ___ but persistent. Pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis obscure the costophrenic angles. Low inspiratory lung volumes are unchanged. Prominence of the mediastinum suggest an ectatic thoracic aorta. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged in the setting of low lung volumes.
