Tip of endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube has been removed with development of mild-to-moderate gastric distention. Heart is mildly enlarged and is accompanied by worsening pulmonary vascular congestion and widespread asymmetrically distributed alveolar opacities. These findings most likely represent asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but differential diagnosis includes massive aspiration and rapidly progressive pneumonia. A sharply defined lucency has developed at the right lung base adjacent to the diaphragm contour and is associated with an apparent localized area of subcutaneous emphysema in the adjacent chest wall. This raises the concern for a basilar pneumothorax, which could be confirmed with a left lateral decubitus view of the right lung. Dr. ___ was telephoned to discuss this result at 8:15 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.
