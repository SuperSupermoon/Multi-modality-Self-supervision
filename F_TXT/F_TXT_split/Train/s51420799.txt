AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The ET tube tip is in unchanged position, approximately 6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm with its tip being at least in the stomach. Surgical drain is projecting next to the NG tube. Bilateral pleural effusions, bibasal atelectasis are unchanged as well as the position of the left subclavian line. Assessment of the mediastinum is difficult due to severe dextroscoliosis.
