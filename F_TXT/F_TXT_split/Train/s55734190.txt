As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. The pre-described interstitial markings have increased in severity. These interstitial markings are now accompanied by an increasing diameter of the pulmonary vasculature, increased peribronchial cuffing and increased perihilar haze. Overall , the findings are now suggestive of mild to moderate pulmonary edema rather than of a pure airways disease. In addition, areas of mild atelectasis have newly appeared at both lung bases. There is blunting of the left and right costophrenic sinuses, potentially indicating minimal pleural effusion. The abnormalities were observed at 12:26 p.m., ___. At the same time point, the referring physician, ___. ___, was paged for notification. The findings were subsequently discussed over the telephone.
