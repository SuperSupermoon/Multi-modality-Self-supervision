A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. There are patchy bibasilar opacities which are presumably atelectasis/scarring and similar to prior exam; however, pneumonia cannot be excluded. Prominence of the pulmonary arteries, suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension are unchanged. Heart size is normal in size. There is no strong evidence for pulmonary edema.
