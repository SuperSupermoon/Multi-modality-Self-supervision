Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. Subcutaneous emphysema is extensive, unchanged since the prior study. Within the limitations of the presence of subcutaneous emphysema, there is no definitive evidence of left pneumothorax after removal of the left chest tube. Aortic valve is noted in the expected position. The mediastinum is unchanged in appearance. Vertical lucency along the sternum is redemonstrated, with the width of less than 3 mm, unlikely to represent dehiscence at this point. Small amount of bilateral pleural effusion is most likely present.
