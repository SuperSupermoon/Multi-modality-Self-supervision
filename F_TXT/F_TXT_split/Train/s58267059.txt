As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The patient still presents with low lung volumes and mild fluid overload as well as with a markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette and subsequent areas of bilateral basal opacities. The presence of minimal pleural effusions cannot be excluded. Overall, there is no relevant change as compared to the previous image.
