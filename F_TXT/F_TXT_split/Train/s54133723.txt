As compared to the previous radiograph, the transparency of the lung parenchyma has increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. This improvement is visible on both the right and the left. However, a small retrocardiac atelectasis persists and the size of the cardiac silhouette is still enlarged. No evidence of pneumonia. The ___ device and the endotracheal tube are in unchanged position.
