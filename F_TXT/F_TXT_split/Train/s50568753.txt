Patient is status post left upper lobe wedge resection with postoperative changes noted. There has been interval removal of the right IJ central line. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Opacity at the left lung base, not significantly changed compared to multiple prior studies, likely reflects layering pleural effusion. There is minimal pleural effusion on the right. Focal opacity at the right mid to lower lung is worsening and may reflect pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.
