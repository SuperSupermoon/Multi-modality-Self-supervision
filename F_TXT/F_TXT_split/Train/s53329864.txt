Combination of new interstitial and ground-glass opacity in the lower lungs, greater pulmonary vascular distention and persistent mediastinal venous engorgement points to pulmonary edema, and also explains the new moderate left and small right pleural effusions. Lobulation to the pulmonary hila is presumably due to transient vascular distension, but should be re-evaluated after treatment of edema to exclude adenopathy. No pneumothorax.
