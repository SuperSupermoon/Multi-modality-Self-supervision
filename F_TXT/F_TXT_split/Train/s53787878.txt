As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube has been removed. The pre-existing right pneumothorax is no longer visible, the presence of a minimal air-fluid level at the very apex of the right lung suggests some minimal air inclusion in the pleural space. The second chest tube on the right is in unchanged position. The extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion is constant. Also constant are areas of moderate atelectasis at the right lung base. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged appearance of the left lung.
