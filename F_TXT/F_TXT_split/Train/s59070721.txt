Substantial consolidation of the right lower and right middle lobe is likely atelectatic in the post-operative setting; however, infection cannot be excluded. A component of pleural effusion may possibly add to this right lower lung consolidation. The right lung apex and left lung are clear. There is no pneumothorax. The right heart border is partially obscured by the adjacent consolidation; however, the heart size is likely normal with normal mediastinal and hilar contours.
