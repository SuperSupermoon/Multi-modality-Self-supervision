Endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina, Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the region of the right ventricular outflow tract, and nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Left-sided chest tubes are in place with a small left apical pneumothorax. A localized area of increased opacity is present in the left supraaortic region at the site of recent surgical repair of a known aneurysm. Attention to this region on short-term follow up radiographs is recommended. Mild interstitial edema involves the left lung to a greater degree than the right, and note is also made of atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region as well as subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall.
