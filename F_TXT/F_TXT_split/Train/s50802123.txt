In comparison with study of earlier in this date, the pulmonary vascular congestion appears somewhat improved. The hemi diaphragms are not sharply seen, raising the possibility of layering effusion with volume loss in the lower lungs. Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it is extremely difficult to assess for possible right middle lobe pneumonia. If the condition of the patient would permit, a lateral view would be most helpful for further evaluation.
