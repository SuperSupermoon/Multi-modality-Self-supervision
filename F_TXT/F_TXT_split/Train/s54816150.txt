AP portable upright view of the chest. An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located approximately 4.3 cm above the carina. An NG tube extends into the left upper abdomen though the tip is positioned only 7 8 cm beyond the GE junction. Advancement may result in more optimal positioning. A left hilar mass is noted with volume loss and increased ground-glass opacity within the right lung most notable on the left mid and upper lung. Findings are concerning for malignancy with postobstructive collapse and/or pneumonia and CT U is recommended to further assess. Left lung is clear. Chronic bilateral rib deformities are noted. No large effusion on this supine radiograph. No definite signs of pneumothorax. Extensive thoracic spinal fusion hardware noted.
