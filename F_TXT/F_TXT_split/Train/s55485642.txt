There may be a small region of new peribronchial opacification in the left midlung. I would recommendconventional chest radiographs at full inspiration. Heart size top-normal unchanged. Lobulation and hyper attenuation of the left hilus suggests calcified lymph nodes. Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC.
