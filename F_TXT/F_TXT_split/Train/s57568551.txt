Lung volumes are low. There is chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Cardiac silhouette size appears mild to moderately enlarged, as seen previously. The mediastinal contour is similar. Hilar contours are relatively unchanged with no evidence for pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity in the right lung base likely reflects an area of atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. Minimal atelectasis is also noted in the retrocardiac region. There may be a trace right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified, though assessment of the medial aspect of the lung apices is somewhat obscured by the patient's chin overlying this area. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
