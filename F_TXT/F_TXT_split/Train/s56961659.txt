In comparison with study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube appears to extend only to the upper stomach. The side hole is not sharply seen, though it probably is above the esophagogastric junction and the tube should be pushed forward. Continued hyperexpansion of the lungs with areas of increased opacification at the bases, consistent with areas of consolidation. Relative paucity of vessels in the upper lobe persist, consistent with severe emphysema.
