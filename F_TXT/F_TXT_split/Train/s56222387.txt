The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and left subclavian central line remain in place. The heart remains upper limits of normal in size and is less globular in configuration than on the prior study making pericardial effusion less likely. There is diffuse airspace process which may represent severe pulmonary edema, although aspiration or hemorrhage could also have this appearance. Lucency in the left deep costophrenic sulcus is less apparent and given that this is a semi-upright study, likely is projectional as there is no evidence of a pneumothorax on the current examination up near the apex.
