Compared with prior radiograph, lung volumes are lower accentuating the moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette. Indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion and there is mild pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Multiple lines and drains overlie the lower thorax and upper abdomen, likely relating to recent surgery.
