In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. There is continued opacification at the left base consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Less prominent effusion and atelectasis is seen on the right. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, possibly with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Given the changes in the cardiac size and pulmonary parenchyma, the possibility of a basilar or retrocardiac opacification consistent with pneumonia is difficult to exclude on this single frontal image.
