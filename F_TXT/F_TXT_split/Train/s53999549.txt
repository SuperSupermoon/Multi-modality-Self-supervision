In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the monitoring and support devices. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal. Opacification bilaterally most likely reflects layering pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, more prominent on the right. Retrocardiac opacification silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. Probable mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
