Worsening, now almost complete opacification of the right hemithorax, likely due to a combination of known loculated right pleural effusion and a combination of collapse and consolidation within the right middle and right lower lobes in this patient with known right upper lobe resection. The possibility of acute plugging of the bronchus intermedius should be considered, and bronchoscopy may be helpful in this regard. Additionally, there is worsening pulmonary vascular congestion and increasing interstitial edema in the left lung as well as a slight increase in a small to moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent left retrocardiac atelectasis.
