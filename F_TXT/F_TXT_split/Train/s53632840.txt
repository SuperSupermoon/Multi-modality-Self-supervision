Severe pulmonary edema has changed in distribution. It may have improved slightly since earlier in the day. Small right pleural effusion is stable. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged but mediastinal vascular distention may have improved slightly. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric tube can be traced as far as the level of the diaphragm, but I cannot tell whether it needs to be advanced to move all the side ports into the stomach. .
