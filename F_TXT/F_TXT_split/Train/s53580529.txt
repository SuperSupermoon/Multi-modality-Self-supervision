There is apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette likely in part due to pectus deformity seen on prior film. Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is again noted. Surgical clips project over the right paratracheal region and there is associated right hemithorax volume loss. There are also surgical clips projecting over the left lung base, potentially within the overlying soft tissues. Lungs are clear without consolidation or edema. No acute osseous abnormality.
