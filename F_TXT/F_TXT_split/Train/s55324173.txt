AP chest compared to ___, 9:48 a.m.: Both the apex and lateral aspect of the lower left hemithorax are excluded from the examination, so pneumothorax cannot be evaluated in those regions. The imaged portions of the pleural space are normal. Mild atelectasis at the left base is stable. Lungs are otherwise clear. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Tip of the endotracheal tube is in standard position, and an upper enteric drainage tube ends in the distal stomach.
