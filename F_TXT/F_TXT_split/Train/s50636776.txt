Following recent transbronchial biopsy procedure of a right juxta hilar mass, the mass is less well defined, and surrounding opacities have worsened. This could be due to post procedural hemorrhage or secondary process such as aspiration or infection. No definite pneumothorax is identified. Small curvilinear opacity adjacent to the fourth posterior right rib appears to extend beyond the pleura and may reflect a structure external to the patient. However, considering recent procedure, repeat radiograph would be helpful to exclude an atypical pneumothorax. Exam is otherwise similar to the prior study except for new linear atelectasis at the left base.
