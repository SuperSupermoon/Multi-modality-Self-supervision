As compared to the previous radiograph, the current image is taken in a highly rotated patient position. As a result, hyperlucency of the left lung apex without definite signs of pneumothorax is seen. The pre-existing opacity at the right lung apex is unchanged. Lung volumes have minimally decreased, but the pre-existing signs suggesting fluid overload have decreased. No evidence of pleural effusions, interposition of colon between the liver and the abdominal wall. Unchanged position of the right internal jugular vein catheter. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
