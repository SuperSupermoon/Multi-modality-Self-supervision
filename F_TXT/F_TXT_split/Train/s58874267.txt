As compared to the previous radiograph, the appearance of the cardiac silhouette, the monitoring and support devices, the retrocardiac atelectasis and the remaining lung parenchyma are unchanged. Only the right lung base has slightly increased in radio transparency, reflecting improved ventilation. No other relevant changes.
