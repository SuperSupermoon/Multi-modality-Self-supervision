Comparison is made to prior study from ___. The endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and right IJ central line are unchanged in position. The distal tip of the right IJ line is again in the proximal right atrium. This could be pulled back 1-2 cm for more optimal placement. There are no pneumothoraces. There is small pleural effusion on the right side. There is some prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of pulmonary edema, stable.
