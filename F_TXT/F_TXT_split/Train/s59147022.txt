An endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina. An enteric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view. A left subclavian catheter terminates in the right atrium and could be withdrawn 2-3 cm for positioning in the low SVC, if desired. A right chest tube is unchanged in position and directed superiorly. There is no definite pneumothorax. In comparison to 2 hours prior, there has been collapse of the right upper lobe with superior displacement of the minor fissure. The right middle and lower lobes remain well-aerated. The left lung is clear. No pleural effusion.
