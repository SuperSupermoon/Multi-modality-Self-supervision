As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. There are areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases. Pre-existing scarring in the perihilar lung regions and in the upper lobes bilaterally is minimally more severe than on the previous image. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
