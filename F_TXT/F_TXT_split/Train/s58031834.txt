Combined consolidation and atelectasis within the lingula has minimally improved as evidenced by new visualization of a small portion of the left heart border. However, an adjacent area of opacity at the left lung base has slightly worsened. Bilateral upper lobe predominant emphysema is again demonstrated. Volume loss and architectural distortion in the right lung are consistent with previous right upper lobe lobectomy changes with some associated pleural and parenchymal scarring.
