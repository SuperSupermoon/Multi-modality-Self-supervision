AP chest compared to ___: There has been no change in severely low lung volumes, moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary and mediastinal venous engorgement. Mild pulmonary edema has also been relatively constant. The combination of low lung volumes and the vascular plethora could hide small lung nodules such as septic emboli. If that is a clinical concern, then chest CT scanning would be indicated. A large bore right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium, as before. No pneumothorax.
