No previous images. The tip of the endotracheal tube lies above the level of the clavicles, approximately 8.4 cm above the carina. There are relatively low lung volumes with the cardiac silhouette at the upper limits of normal in size. No vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. The left hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen, suggesting some pleural fluid and atelectasis at the left base. Minimal atelectatic changes are seen at the right base. The nasogastric tube is somewhat difficult to see, though it appears to be coiling within the fundus of the stomach.
