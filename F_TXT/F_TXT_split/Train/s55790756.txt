1. Right basilar chest tube remains in place. There is right lateral pleural thickening and blunting of the right costophrenic angle which likely reflects pleural fluid and thickening. A more elliptical opacity in the right mid to lower lung is also stable and may represent loculated fluid within the fissure or partial middle lobe collapse. Overall, there has been no significant interval change in appearance of the right lung. Left lung continues to demonstrate some patchy retrocardiac opacity which could reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. Heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
