Vascular access catheters are unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study. No pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion seen. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged compared to the prior study. There is persistent linear atelectasis at the left lung base, there has been interval resolution of the right basal opacity which is likely therefore reflected atelectasis. There is a new airspace opacity at the left costophrenic angle which likely reflects an additional area of a atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
