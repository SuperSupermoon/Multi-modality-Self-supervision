1. Left internal jugular, Swan-Ganz catheter in unchanged position. Nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Two left-sided chest tubes remain in place. The endotracheal tube has a radiographic component which appears to terminate in the proximal left main stem bronchus. If this is a single-lumen tube then pull back of approximately 5-6 cm would be advised. However, upon speaking with the patient's nurse, ___, on ___ at 11:50 a.m., she reports that this is a dual lumen endotracheal tube, although the second radiographic component is not definitely visualized. Coiled radioopaque material projecting over the left mid lung is again seen, which is concerning for a retained sponge or surgical packing vs. being external to the patient. Clinical correlation is advised. ___ was notified of this finding on ___ at 10:27 a.m. by phone. There is likely a small layering right effusion. There continues to be indistinctness of the left vasculature, which likely reflects asymmetric pulmonary edema in this recently postoperative patient status post median sternotomy with AAA repair and CABG. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
