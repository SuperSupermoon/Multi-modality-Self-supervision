A portable AP radiograph of the chest depicts new diffuse opacification of left lung, likely secondary to mild edema produced by the operation. The left mid lung field is slightly denser, which may represent persistence of the loculated pleural effusions seen on the prior radiograph from ___. Two left basilar and one left apical pleural drainage catheters are present. There is a small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis. Very mild right lower lobe linear atelectasis or scarring is unchanged. The right lung is otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax and the heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
