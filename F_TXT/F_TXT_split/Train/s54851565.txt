AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Tracheostomy cannula as before. In addition to the previously existing NG tube, another second tube has been advanced and passes through the esophagus, seen to terminate in the distal stomach pointing towards the duodenum. The termination point of the line, however, is not included in the image field. Chest findings are unaltered and again demonstrate bilateral pleural effusions. They are slightly more basally oriented in comparison with the previous study, which can be explained that the patient's position was changed from supine to semi-erect. There is no evidence of new pulmonary infiltrates or pneumothorax.
