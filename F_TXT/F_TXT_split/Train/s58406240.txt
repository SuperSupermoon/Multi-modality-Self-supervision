Exam is limited due to low lung volumes, portable technique and overlying soft tissues. Streaky left basilar opacity is likely atelectasis. Somewhat linear right midlung opacity is obscured by overlying chest wall port. There is no large confluent consolidation or obvious effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
