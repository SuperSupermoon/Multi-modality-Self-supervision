No previous images. Relatively low lung volumes accentuate the degree of enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with previous CABG procedure and intact midline sternal wires. No definite vascular congestion. The discordancy raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. There is some increased opacification at the left base consistent with some combination of atelectasis and small effusion. Suggestion of an area of increased opacification at the right base that could represent a developing consolidation.
