Compared with ___ at 05:16, I doubt significant interval change. An ET tube tip lies approximately 5.8 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip and side-port beneath diaphragm. Left subclavian PICC line tip lies at the SVC/RA junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution and minimal bibasilar atelectasis, similar to the prior film. No pneumothorax detected. Biapical pleural thickening again noted. Lumbar spine fixation hardware is again noted .
