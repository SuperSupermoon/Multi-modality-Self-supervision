A right IJ line sheath remains, following removal of a Swan-___ catheter. A right thoracostomy tube is present. The lung volumes are low, resulting on bronchovascular crowding. No pneumothorax is detected. There is an increased left retrocardiac opacity, likely reflecting atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. A small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
