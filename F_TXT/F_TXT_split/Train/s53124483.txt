The cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with lymphadenopathy again noted. Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries likely reflects pulmonary arterial hypertension. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. New patchy opacity in the right lung base could reflect an area of infection or atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
