In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The appearance could reflect severe pulmonary edema, though other coexisting process such as pneumonia or ARDS would be impossible to exclude radiographically. Tracheostomy tube and hemodialysis catheter remain in place. Retrocardiac opacification with poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
