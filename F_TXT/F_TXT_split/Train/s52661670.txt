Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and dilatation of the right pulmonary artery have increased, small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are new, and there is mild pulmonary edema in the central right lung. There is no pneumothorax. Overall, findings suggest biventricular cardiac decompensation rather than pneumonia. Left trans subclavian right atrial biventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in their positions, continuous from the left pectoral generator.
