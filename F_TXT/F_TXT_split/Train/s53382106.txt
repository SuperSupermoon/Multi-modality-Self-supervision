As compared to the previous radiograph, the left PICC line is in unchanged position. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. The signs of moderate to severe pulmonary edema, with a strong interstitial component, have decreased in severity. Edema, however, is still moderate. Blunting of the costophrenic sinus could be caused by a small pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No new focal parenchymal opacities.
