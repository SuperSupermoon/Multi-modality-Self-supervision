Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. An enteric tube courses to the body of the stomach. The AICD lead terminates in the right ventricle.

Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. No pneumothorax. Left pleural effusion is presumed, but not large. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch is an incidental finding.
