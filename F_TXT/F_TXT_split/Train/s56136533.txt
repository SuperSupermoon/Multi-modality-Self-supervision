Stable cardiomegaly and persistent diffuse airspace opacities involving the left lung to a much greater degree than the right. Overall, this appears similar to the recent radiograph. Moderate left pleural effusion appears slightly larger, and small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Chronic volume loss and scarring in right upper lobe appears similar.
