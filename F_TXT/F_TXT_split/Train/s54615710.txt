In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5.1 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. There has been the development of increased opacification at the right base medially. This could represent volume loss in the right lower lung, though the appearance could certainly represent a developing pneumonia with aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting. The left lung is clear and there is no appreciable pulmonary vascular congestion.
