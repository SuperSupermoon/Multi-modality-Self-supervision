Cardiomediastinal contours are without change and demonstrate a large hiatal hernia, shown to better detail on prior CT. Worsening predominantly linear bibasilar opacities are accompanied by adjacent small pleural effusions or pleural thickening. Apparent bronchial wall thickening in right middle and lower lobes could be due to aspiration in the setting of a hiatial hernia; alternatively, this could reflect airway infection given history of bronchiectasis provided by ICU team. Lung volumes are increased suggesting COPD. Biapical pleural and parenchymal scarring is similar to an older chest radiograph ___ ___.
