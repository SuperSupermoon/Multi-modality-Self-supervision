Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. Persistent cardiomegaly and widening of vascular pedicle. Bilateral combined alveolar and interstitial opacities appear minimally improved, with persistent more confluent opacities in the right lung base medially with adjacent elevation of right hemidiaphragm. Considering the presence of longstanding interstitial fibrosis, observed findings could represent acute exacerbation of chronic lung disease. Alternatively, this may reflect chronic lung disease complicated by infection, edema or ARDS.
