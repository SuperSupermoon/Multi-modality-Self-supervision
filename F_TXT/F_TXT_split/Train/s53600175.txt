In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with left ventricular configuration and dual-pacer with leads appropriately placed in the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle. No evidence of vascular congestion. Retrocardiac opacification probably represents atelectasis and possible small effusion. Atelectatic changes are also seen above the elevated right hemidiaphragm. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
