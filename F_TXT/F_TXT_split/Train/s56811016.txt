No previous images. Endotracheal tube tip is at the upper clavicular level, approximately 7.2 cm above the carina. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and there is some engorgement of central vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. There is some asymmetry of opacification with more opacification at the left base. This could reflect atelectasis, though the possibility of supervening pneumonia should be seriously considered if there are appropriate clinical symptoms. A band of atelectasis is seen at the right base.
