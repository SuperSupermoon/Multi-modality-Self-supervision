Cardiac silhouette appears top normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Both lungs show no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Minimal left basilar atelectasis is noted. Slightly prominent right hilum is better evaluated on subsequent CT. Two small calcified nodules are noted in the left upper lobe, which may be granulomas. A surgical clip is noted projecting over the right upper apex.
