As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube projects 3 cm above the carina with its tip. Otherwise, there is no relevant change. The other monitoring and support devices are constant, with the exception of a nasogastric tube that has been newly inserted. Course of the tube is unremarkable. No complications, notably no pneumothorax.
