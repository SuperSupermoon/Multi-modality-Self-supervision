There is complete opacification of the left hemi thorax. In combination with left-sided volume loss and surgical clips, findings are suggestive of prior left pneumonectomy. Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 2.8 cm from the expected region of the carina which is not well visualized. Hazy opacity projects over the right lung. This could represent a combination of infection edema or layering effusion. Right-sided central venous catheter projects to the left of midline, exact location is difficult to assess given altered anatomy. Cardiac silhouette for similar reasons cannot be assessed. No acute osseous abnormalities.
