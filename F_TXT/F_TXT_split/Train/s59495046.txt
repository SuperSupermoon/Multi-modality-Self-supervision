No previous images. There are relatively low lung volumes with tortuosity of the descending aorta and what could be a calcified pleural plaque at the left base. No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion. What appears to be a single channel pacer extends to the region of the apex to the right ventricle. There is a shoulder arthroplasty on the left and severe degenerative changes in the right shoulder.
