As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The endotracheal tube is still positioned too high and should be advanced by 1-2 cm. The lung is better ventilated than before, but pleural effusions and basal areas of atelectasis as well as signs of fluid overload are still present. The patient shows no evidence of newly appeared parenchymal opacities in the interval. No pneumothorax.
