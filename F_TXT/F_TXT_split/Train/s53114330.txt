There has been interval intubation with the endotracheal tube terminating 4.1 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube courses inferior to the diaphragm and extends beyond the imaged field. The heart remains mildly enlarged and there is mild central pulmonary vascular congestion. Bibasilar atelectasis and trace bilateral pleural effusions are noted. There is no pneumothorax identified. The upper lungs are grossly clear. No acute fractures identified. Note that the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax is excluded on this radiograph.
