Given the patient's age, I doubt that the minimal interstitial abnormality visible is acute edema. There is atelectasis at both lung bases, left greater than right. Heart is mildly-to-moderately enlarged, comparable to the size on the chest CT in ___, which also showed substantial aortic valvular calcification, suggesting stenosis. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. Cement vertebroplasty noted at multiple levels in the thoracic spine, as well as severely degenerated right shoulder.
