Frontal radiograph of the chest shows stable bilateral alveolar opacities with unchanged ECMO catheter, endotracheal tube, and enteric tube. The endotracheal tube tip projects roughly 8 cm from the carina, and appears different from the previous x-ray likely due to the patient's chin now being up. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
