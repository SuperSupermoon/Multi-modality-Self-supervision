The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach. The heart is normal in size. The aortic arch is calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. The extreme left costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded, but there is no evidence for pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is patchy left basilar opacity which is most likely to represent minor atelectasis. Two small apparent nodular densities project over the left mid lung and may be artifactual or potentially could represent true lung nodules, however. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Gallstones project over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
