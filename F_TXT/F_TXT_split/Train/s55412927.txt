New diffuse bilateral opacification, although mildly asymmetric. Cardiomegaly, perhaps somewhat increased. Differential considerations include acute respiratory distress syndrome stemming from pneumonia, pulmonary edema or diffuse pneumonia. However, given how mild the pneumonia appeared only three days ago and rapid onset of diffuse opacification with cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema may be favored. Clinical correlation is recommended, however. Low positioning of endotracheal tube and proximal positioning of nasogastric tubes, which could be repositioned somewhat for more optimal positioning if clinically indicated.
