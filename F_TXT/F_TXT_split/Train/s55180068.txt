The lungs are moderately well inflated. Bilateral perihilar interstitial opacities with moderate cardiomegaly and small left pleural effusion is noted. Heterogeneous opacity in the left mid lung is present. No right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable. Calcified aortic arch is present. Severe degenerative disease of the right shoulder is noted. There is a new stent projecting over the left upper hemi thorax at the level of the clavicle, likely related to hemodialysis.
