AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided. As seen previously, there are bilateral pleural effusions slightly increased on the left and stable on the right. The subjacent opacities in the lower lungs could represent atelectasis versus pneumonia. The upper lungs are well aerated. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures are intact. TIPS partially imaged in the right upper quadrant.
