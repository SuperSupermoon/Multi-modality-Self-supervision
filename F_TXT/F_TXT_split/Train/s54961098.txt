AP chest compared to ___: Large scale opacification previously limited to the right mid and lower lung zones now involves all of the right lung and the mid and lower portions of the left, accompanied by increasing moderate bilateral pleural effusion. Heart size is normal and mediastinal veins are not particularly enlarged. Pulmonary edema would be the simplest explanation, but in the absence of indications of volume overload, one should also consider concurrent pneumonia. Right PIC line ends low in the SVC, feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective positions; the ventricular lead ends above the floor and in the mid portion of the cavity of the right ventricle. No pneumothorax.
