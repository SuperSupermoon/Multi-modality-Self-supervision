Left internal jugular central venous catheter is seen, terminating in the proximal SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. Patchy left basilar opacity is more conspicuous as compared to the prior study which may be due to overlap of vascular structures although underlying aspiration or developing infection are not excluded. Cavitary structure previously seen in the right mid to lower lung is more conspicuous on prior studies including that earlier today. No pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
