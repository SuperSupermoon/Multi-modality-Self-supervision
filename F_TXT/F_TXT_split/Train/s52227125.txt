As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of pulmonary edema have slightly decreased in severity. Mild fluid overload, however, is still present. The lung volumes remain low and the cardiac silhouette, particular the left ventricle, continued to be enlarged. There is no larger pleural effusion and no evidence of pneumonia. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged in extent.
