Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiac size is partially obscured by the lung abnormalities. Mediastinum is unchanged. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Right PICC tip in the mid SVC. Large central supraclavicular catheter is in standard position. Left apical chest tube is in place. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm, likely in the stomach. A drain projects in the left upper quadrant. Increased density of the left hemithorax is due to layering pleural effusion. Few radiolucencies in the right lower lobe might represent areas of cavitation. Right upper peripheral opacities have minimally improved. Right perihilar opacities are unchanged. Left perihilar opacities have improved. If any, there is a small left pleural effusion. Right humeral fracture is again noted.
