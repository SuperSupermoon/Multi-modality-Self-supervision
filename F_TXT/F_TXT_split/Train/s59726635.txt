In comparison with the study of ___, there is more coalescence of opacification at the right base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm. This is consistent with volume loss in the right lower lobe, probably with pneumonia as suggested by the recent CT scan. Less prominent opacification at the left base could represent atelectasis or multifocal pneumonia. No evidence of cardiomegaly or appreciable vascular congestion.
