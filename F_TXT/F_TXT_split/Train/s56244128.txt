AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are lower after tracheal extubation which may explain to some extent the apparent increase in moderately severe pulmonary edema, but this does suggest cardiac decompensation or volume overload. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. Post-operative cardiac silhouette is slightly wider now than it was earlier when the patient was intubated. There is no pneumothorax.
