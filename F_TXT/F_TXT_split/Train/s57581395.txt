Interval placement of nasogastric tube with its tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach. There is increasing patchy opacity predominantly at the right base and to a lesser extent at the left base with increasing layering right pleural effusion. Although these findings may represent partial lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion, pneumonia at the right base cannot be entirely excluded. There is some interstitial prominence, right greater than left, although there is no evidence of peribronchial cuffing to suggest pulmonary edema. Therefore, the significance of this finding is uncertain and can be further evaluated on followup imaging. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. No pneumothorax.
