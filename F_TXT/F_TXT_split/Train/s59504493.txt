A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. The left Port-A-Cath ends in the lower SVC. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is smaller than on the prior study, though still with moderate cardiomegaly, probably due to resolution of a pericardial effusion. Pulmonary vascular engorgement has decreased, and there is no pulmonary edema. Surgical clips project over the left upper quadrant.
