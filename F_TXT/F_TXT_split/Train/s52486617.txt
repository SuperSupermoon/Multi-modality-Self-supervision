Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Multifocal predominately linear atelectasis is present in both lower lungs. A more focal patchy opacity in the left retrocardiac region may reflect more extensive atelectasis, but differential diagnosis includes aspiration and developing infectious pneumonia. Small pleural effusions are also noted.
