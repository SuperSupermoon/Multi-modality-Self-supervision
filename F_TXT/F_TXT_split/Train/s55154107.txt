AP chest compared to ___ at 4:53 p.m.: Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn to standard position. Nevertheless, severe left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened. This could be the residual of the contralateral intubation documented earlier in the day, but poor definition of the left bronchial tree suggests retained secretions. ___ be a small left pleural effusion, not unexpected in the setting of lower lobe collapse. Atelectasis in the right lung is minimal. Heart size is indeterminate, probably top normal. Contour of the mediastinum in the region of the AP window should be reevaluated when the lung is fully expanded. Many healed left rib fractures are present. No pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends low in the right atrium. No evidence of mediastinal bleeding.
