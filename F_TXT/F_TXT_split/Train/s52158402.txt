As on the prior study, there are very low lung volumes. Retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm is constant, concerning for infection or sequelae of aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting. Streaky opacities at the right lung base are unchanged and may represent atelectasis. There are bilateral pleural effusions which appear unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
