As compared to the previous radiograph, a second PICC line has been inserted into the left pleural space. The previously seen lateral line suggesting pneumothorax is now no longer clearly visible. The bases of the left lung appears better expanded than on the previous image. Also improved distal ventilation of the right lung. However, cardiomegaly and moderate right pleural effusion persists. There are very extensive bilateral air collections in the soft tissues, with the creation of multiple hyperlucent lines, so that the assessment for potential pneumothorax is clearly limited.
