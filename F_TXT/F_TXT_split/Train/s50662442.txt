The persistent interstitial infiltrative abnormality involving most of the left lung and the lower right lung has varied from day today, but not significantly improved. An overlay of pulmonary edema has made it appear worse at times, today for example accompanied by small pleural effusions larger than on ___. Heart size is only top-normal, and mediastinal veins are generally not dilated. The diagnosis of the pulmonary infiltration escapes me. Left PIC line ends at the origin of the SVC and a right supraclavicular central venous dialysis line ends in the mid and lower SVC.
