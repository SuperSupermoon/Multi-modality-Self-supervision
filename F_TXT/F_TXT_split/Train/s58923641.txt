As compared to the previous radiograph, there is massively increasing right pleural effusion, with a mass effect and displacement of the mediastinal structures towards the left. The tracheostomy tube and the nasogastric tube are in constant position. The left lung is unremarkable, with the exception of small areas of retrocardiac atelectasis.
