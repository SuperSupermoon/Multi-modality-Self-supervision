AP chest compared to ___: Poor expansion of the post-operative right lung has not improved, small basal layering component of pleural effusion has been replaced with air, and the larger apical component of persistent pleural space is essentially unchanged and largely filled with air. Left lung is mildly hyperemic but there is no consolidation, atelectasis or appreciable edema. Heart size is normal, smaller today than yesterday. ET tube and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements.
