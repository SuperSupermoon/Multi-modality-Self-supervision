Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.1 cm from the carina. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Patchy opacity within the left lung base likely reflects an area of atelectasis, somewhat improved compared to the prior study. Tubular radiopaque density projecting over the heart size may be external to the patient. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
