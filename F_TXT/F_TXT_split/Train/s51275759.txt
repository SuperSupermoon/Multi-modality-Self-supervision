Allowing for differences in technique, there has not been a relevant change in the appearance of the chest since recent study of 1 day earlier. Bilateral pulmonary nodules and masses, some demonstrating cavitation, are grossly unchanged and remain concerning for widespread metastatic disease in this patient with history of colon cancer. Dominant left lung lesions may have a pleural component and note is also made of a persistent small left pleural effusion. Lower right lateral rib abnormality could potentially be metastatic as well. Consider chest CT if not already performed outside.
