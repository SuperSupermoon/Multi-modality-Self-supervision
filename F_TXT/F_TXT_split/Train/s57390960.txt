The extreme upper edge of the right and left chest is excluded from the film. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.1 cm above the carina, at the level of the mid clavicular heads. A right IJ central line is present, tip overlying cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax detected. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal, not significantly changed. Innumerable small, irregular opacities are seen throughout both lungs, with a somewhat peripheral distribution. In addition, there appear to be slightly coarsened interstitial markings diffusely in both lungs. These are similar, but, on the left, slightly more pronounced. No obvious cavitation is appreciated. No left pleural effusion. The right lower chest is excluded from the film, but no gross right effusion is seen.
