An overlying trauma board and support devices obscure the radiograph. The endotracheal tube ends 7 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular line ends in the upper superior vena cava. The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged. Mild widening of the mediastinum is likely positional. There is no right pleural effusion. The left costophrenic angle is not included on the film. Diffused increased opacity in the left lung may be due to positioning or a layering pleural effusion. There are right-sided rib fractures. There are no focal opacities. No pneumothorax identified. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
