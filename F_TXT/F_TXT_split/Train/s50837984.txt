AP chest compared to ___: Variations in the severity of apparent bibasilar consolidation over the past several days suggest that dependent edema and atelectasis are playing a larger role radiographically than pneumonia. Any pneumonia is most likely in the right lower lobe posterior basal segment. Currently, pulmonary vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema are still present, severe cardiomegaly is chronic, and there is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Tracheostomy tube and right PIC line are in standard placements and a feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
