Single erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The left hemidiaphragm remains elevated. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which could be due to a small pleural effusion. Left retrocardiac opacity is seen, which may be due to underpenetration, although underlying consolidation and/or pleural effusion, atelectasis not excluded. There is prominence of the central vasculature and the interstitium suggesting pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified.
