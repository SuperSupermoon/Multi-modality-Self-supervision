NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. ET tube tip is in standard position, 5.1 cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper right atrium, can be withdrawn a couple of centimeters for more standard position. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Worsening opacities in the left lower lobe are consistent with worsening atelectasis when compared to prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved. Atelectasis in the left upper lobe medially is unchanged.
