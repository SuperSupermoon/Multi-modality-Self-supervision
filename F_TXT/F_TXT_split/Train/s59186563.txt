Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Cardiomegaly is severe but unchanged associated with bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis. No change in the mediastinal appearance is seen, but there is slight interval increase in vascular engorgement that may reflect worsening in interstitial pulmonary edema/volume overload. No pneumothorax.
