Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema. More confluent opacities are present at the lung bases, and could reflect dependent edema, aspiration, or infectious pneumonia. Followup PA and lateral radiographs may be helpful in this regard when the patient's condition permits. Probable small left pleural effusion, unchanged.
