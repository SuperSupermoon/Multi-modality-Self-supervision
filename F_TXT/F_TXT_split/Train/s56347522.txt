Bilateral main stem bronchial stents are in position. Left perihilar and medial right apical masses appear similar. There is also unchanged left basilar opacification. There has in fact been little, if any, change since the prior radiographs aside from decreased volume loss at the left base and substantially decreased pleural effusions since the prior CT on the left.
