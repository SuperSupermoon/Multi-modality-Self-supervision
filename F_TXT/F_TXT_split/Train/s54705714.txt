A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. Aeration of the left base has minimally improved since the prior exam two days ago. A left basilar retrocardiac opacity continues to obscure the left hemidiaphragm. No new consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is present. Soft tissue density surrounding a left chest pacer corresponds with the clinically noted pacer pocket hematoma. A single cardiac lead projects over the right ventricle. Cardiomegaly remains mild. The aortic arch and mitral valve anulus are calcified.
