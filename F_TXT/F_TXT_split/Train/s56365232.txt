In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. There are even lower lung volumes with opacification at the bases most likely reflecting areas of atelectasis, more prominent on the left, with possible associated pleural effusions. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
