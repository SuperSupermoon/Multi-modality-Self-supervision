One portable AP view of the chest. There are low lung volumes which crowd the pulmonary vasculature. Within that limitation, the lungs are grossly clear without any obvious consolidation. There is no pneumothorax. There is no large pleural effusion. Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
