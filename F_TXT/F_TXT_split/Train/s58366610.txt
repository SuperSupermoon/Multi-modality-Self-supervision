The lung volumes are low which causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Bilateral, right greater than left, lower lobe opacities most likely represent atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A vascular stent projects over the trachea at the level of the clavicles. The trachea is deviated to the right. Enlargement of the mediastinal and cardiac contours may be due to technique.
