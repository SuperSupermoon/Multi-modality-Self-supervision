The lungs are low in volume, but clear. Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable with normal heart size. Displaced fracture of the one of the left lower ribs is noted without definite pneumothorax or pleural effusion on this supine film. Note, the right costophrenic angle is excluded, but the patient was___ transferred to the operating room, so repeat images were not obtained.
