As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs of overinflation have minimally increased. On a background of minimal fluid overload, there is no evidence of new parenchymal opacities that have occurred in the interval. However, the patient is slightly rotated and the assessment of the image is minimally limited. Therefore, if the clinical complaints persist, a short-term radiographic followup should be performed, if possible in frontal and lateral projection. No cardiomegaly. Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
