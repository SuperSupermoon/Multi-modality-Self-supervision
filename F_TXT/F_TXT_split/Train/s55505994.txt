The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs appear clear. Prior healed rib fractures are noted on the left. A severe thoracolumbar vertebral compression fracture, probably T12, shows no evidence for change. There is, however, below that level, moderate to severe new subchondral sclerosis at the level below, probably L1-L2, suggesting coinciding degenerative change, with milder changes at the intervening level, likely T12-L1.
