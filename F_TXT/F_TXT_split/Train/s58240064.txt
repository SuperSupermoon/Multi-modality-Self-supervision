Comparison is made to the prior study performed on ___ at 8:05 a.m. No definite pneumothorax is seen on this semi-upright study. There is mild improved aeration of the lungs with decrease in right-sided pleural effusion. There is hardware overlying the sternum. A tracheostomy tube, right-sided subclavian catheter, and stent are again visualized and unchanged in position.
