Previously reported biapical pneumothoraces have nearly resolved. Asymmetrical pattern of pulmonary edema has substantially improved and currently affects the right lung to a greater degree than the left. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are present with adjacent atelectasis, the latter slightly worse on the right, but markedly improved on the left since the prior study.
