Compared with earlier the same day, multiple drains and tubes been removed. No pneumothorax is detected. A right IJ central line tip is again seen near the SVC/RA junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, patchy opacity at the right lung base, and small bilateral effusions are also similar to the prior film. 2 punctate radiodensities overlying the region of the left mainstem bronchus presumably represent postoperative changes, possibly small surgical clips.
