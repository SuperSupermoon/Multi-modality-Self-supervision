In comparison with study of ___, the tiny right pneumothorax has cleared. Opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis. Left chest tube is in place and there is no pneumothorax. Opacification in the apical region is again seen and may be slightly larger, consistent with fluid-filled apical cap. Poor definition of the hemidiaphragm on the left is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Endotracheal tube and central catheter are unchanged. Dobbhoff tube coils in the fundus. Nasogastric tube has a similar course and the tips of these two devices are projected at virtually the same position.
