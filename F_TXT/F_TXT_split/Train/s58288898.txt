The mild pulmonary edema is improved from four hours ago. The bibasilar atelectasis and mild cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal. A new right PICC terminates in the upper SVC just beyond the confluence of the right brachiocephalic vein and the SVC.
