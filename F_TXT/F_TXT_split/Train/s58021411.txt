Tracheostomy tube and feeding tube remain in place. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance with persistent marked widening of right superior mediastinal contour, corresponding to known large thyroid mass. This has been more fully characterized by recent MRI exam. Worsening right lower lobe opacity probably represents atelectasis, but coexisting infectious pneumonia is possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Lungs are otherwise clear.
