AP portable upright chest radiograph obtained. The pacer and AICD devices are again seen projecting over the bilateral chest wall with catheter extending into the right ventricle and coronary sinus. Midline sternotomy wires and prosthetic cardiac valve unchanged. The heart remains markedly enlarged. There is slight worsening of pulmonary interstitial edema compared with the prior exam. There is consolidation again noted at the right lung base which is similar to prior. Calcified lesion again noted in the left upper quadrant, which is compatible with a calcified splenic cystic lesion.
