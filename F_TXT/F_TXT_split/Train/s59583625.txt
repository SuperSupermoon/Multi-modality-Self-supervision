As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. Mild fluid overload, however, persists and zone of increased radiodensity is still noted at the right lung bases. On the left, there is unchanged extent of a pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly. No larger pleural effusions. Unchanged position of the right internal jugular vein catheter and of the right pectoral pacemaker.
