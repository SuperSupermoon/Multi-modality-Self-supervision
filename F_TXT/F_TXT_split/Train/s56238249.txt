As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, reflecting improved ventilation. The pre-existing pulmonary edema has further decreased in severity and extent. This decrease is particularly obvious at the right lung basis. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No larger pleural effusions.
