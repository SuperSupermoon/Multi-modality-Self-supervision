Lung volumes are somewhat low on the right with right basilar atelectasis. The trachea is central. Endotracheal tube is in-situ, terminating approximately 5 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. A right sided PICC terminates in the distal SVC. There is prominence of the bilateral hila and upper lobe pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild congestive heart failure. No frank pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen. No consolidation.
