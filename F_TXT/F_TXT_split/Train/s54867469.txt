There is mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Diffuse hazy opacities at the lung bases bilaterally could reflect atelectasis. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is somewhat limited due to overlying opacities. However, there is probable mild cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax or focal consolidation identified.
