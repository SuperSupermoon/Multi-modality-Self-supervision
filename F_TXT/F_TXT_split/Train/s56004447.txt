Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from ___. Exam is limited secondary to patient positioning, her chin overlies the right upper lung and jewelry obscures the left upper lung. There is suggestion of faint patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region. This could potentially represent atelectasis; however, developing consolidation is not excluded. Nodular opacity identified at the right lung base. Included visualization of the right lung is otherwise grossly clear. Cardiac silhouette is stable. Post-vertebroplasty changes identified in the lower thoracic spine. Osseous structures are otherwise grossly unremarkable.
