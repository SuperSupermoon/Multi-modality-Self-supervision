In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle could reflect some small effusion or overlying soft tissues. The medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen, without adjacent areas of increased opacification, consistent with clearing of prior atelectasis in the region. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
