Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The position of the left chest tube is unchanged. There is interval improvement in the subcutaneous air. Within the limitations of this study with overlying subcutaneous air, no appreciable progression of pneumothorax is seen, and currently, only minimal amount of apical pneumothorax is demonstrated. Tracheostomy tube is in place, unchanged in appearance.
