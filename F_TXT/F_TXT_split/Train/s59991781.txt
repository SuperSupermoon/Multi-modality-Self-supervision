A right pleural effusion and an area of atelectasis and parenchymal consolidation at the level of the right hilus, both centrally and peripherally, however, persist. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Old humeral fracture on the right, not visible on the prior chest x-ray, and left-sided humeral head replacement.
