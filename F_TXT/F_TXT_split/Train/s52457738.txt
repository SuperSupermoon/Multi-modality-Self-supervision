As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The tracheostomy tube, the nasogastric tube and the left subclavian access line are in constant position. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. There is unchanged evidence of air inclusions in the left and right lateral soft tissues. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities, notably in the left upper lobe and at both lung bases, are stable. There is no evidence of newly appeared parenchymal opacities. The diameter of the pulmonary vessels still indicates a minimal fluid overload.
