In comparison with the study of ___, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been pulled back so that the tip is in the pulmonary outflow tract. Obliquity of the patient makes it somewhat difficult to compare the appearance of the heart and lungs, though there is probably little change. Other monitoring and support devices are stable and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Hazy opacification at the left base suggests layering pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis. Minimal if any elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
