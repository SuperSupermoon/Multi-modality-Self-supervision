The volume of the right lung has improved but there is focal opacification at the base which could be pneumonia. Small amount of fluid has collected in the possible postoperative pneumatocele, which is overall unchanged in size. Atelectasis at the base of the left lung has not resolved. Left upper lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is a normal postoperative appearance.
