Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a decrease in the bilateral reticular interstitial markings of the lungs. There has also been interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions. These findings suggest a resolving pulmonary edema. There has also been interval increase in the density of the previously seen right hilar, right lower zone, and right upper zone opacities. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
