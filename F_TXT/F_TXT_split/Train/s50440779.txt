Lung volumes are low. Heart size is accentuated by the low lung volumes, and is likely mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion, and the hilar contours are unremarkable. Minimal linear and streaky opacity in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
