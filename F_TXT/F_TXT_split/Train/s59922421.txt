There is increased opacity in the right lung base, likely a combination of moderate pleural effusion and associated consolidation. Findings may reflect atelectasis though aspiration or pneumonia are also within the differential given the clinical history. The remainder of the lungs appear clear. There is no vascular congestion or overt edema. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Evaluation of the cardiac size is limited due to basilar opacity. No pneumothorax is evident. Degenerative changes of the bilateral shoulder joints are noted.
