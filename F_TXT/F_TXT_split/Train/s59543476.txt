As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been slightly advanced. The tip of the tube now projects 5.3 cm above the carina. The course of the nasogastric tubes is constant. Also constant is the position of a left internal jugular vein catheter. A double-lumen right internal jugular vein catheter now replaces the previous intravascular device. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The extensive left-sided parenchymal opacity with parts of consolidations and air bronchograms is overall unchanged in extent and severity. There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting a small left pleural effusion. Unchanged is the atelectasis at the left lung base, in retrocardiac location. The right lung continues to appear normal. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
