There is a left upper chest pacer device with single lead projecting over the right ventricle. There are no apparent abnormalities associated with the device. The mediastinal silhouette and bilateral hila are normal. The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal. There are diffuse bilateral airspace opacities with indistinctness of pulmonary vasculature which likely represents increased pulmonary vascular pressures with moderate pulmonary edema. However, in the setting of fevers and concern for sepsis, especially given left lower lobe volume loss/opacification, this appearance is also concerning for bilateral pneumonia. There is a probable small left pleural effusion. There is no right effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
