There is no pneumothorax. Moderate right pleural effusion is larger, including a fissural component, despite the persistence of a right apical pleural pigtail catheter projecting over the right upper lung. Without a lateral view, I cannot verify that the catheter is internal. Right lower lobe consolidation has probably improved since ___. Severe cardiomegaly has also improved. Mild pulmonary edema has decreased and what may have been questioned as left upper lobe consolidation is clearing. Small to moderate left pleural effusion is presumed, but unchanged. ET tube is in standard placement, with the chin slightly flexed. Esophageal drainage tube ends in the upper stomach. Right jugular line ends in the right atrium, at a level approximately 7 cm below the carina and would need to be withdrawn 3 cm to reposition it in the low SVC, if required.
