As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient develops progressive left lower lobe atelectasis, potentially combined to a small left pleural effusion. A pre-existing opacity at the right lung base, potentially caused by aspiration, is more extensive than on the previous image. No pneumothorax. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position.
