In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, lung volumes are increased. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Previously reported interstitial abnormality is less apparent, potentially due to better expansion of the lungs with reduced crowding of bronchovascular structures. Lungs are remarkable for a subtle area of opacity in the left suprahilar region, potentially due to an early or developing pneumonia given clinical suspicion for infection. Widespread osseous metastases are a known finding.
