Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Since ___, pleural effusions are smaller with adjacent atelectasis, right more than left. Vascular congestion persists. A right subclavian line is unchanged in position. Spinal hardware is incompletely evaluated. No pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable allowing for differences in position and technique. A section of tubing projects over the right axilla. We cannot determine what it is or where it goes. If it is intended to be intra-thoracic or central, it is not, ending at the junction of the second posterolateral rib and scapula.
