There are relatively low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities are seen which may be due to atelectasis; however, early infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to pleural thickening/fluid. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There may be minimal pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
