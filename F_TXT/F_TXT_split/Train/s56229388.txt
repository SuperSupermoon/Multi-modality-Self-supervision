Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube has been removed and a tracheostomy placed. Right atrial, right ventricular, and left ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are in stable position. Right PICC tip is not well visualized. PEG is present below the diaphragm. Consolidation at both lung bases has increased, compatible with worsening pneumonia. Indistinct appearance of the costophrenic angles is compatible with moderate bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
