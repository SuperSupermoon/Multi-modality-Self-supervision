A nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach, with the side port beyond the gastroesophageal junction. An enteric feeding tube loops once in the stomach, courses inferiorly into the duodenum and out of the field of view and the tip can be seen in the proximal jejunum. A tracheostomy tube is appropriately positioned. A left subclavian triple-lumen central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. There are persistent small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. There is improved aeration in the upper lung fields resulting from resolution of mild pulmonary edema. The mediastinal width has also decreased, suggestive of resolution of mild hypervolemia. There is no pneumothorax.
