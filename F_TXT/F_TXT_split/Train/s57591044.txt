Severe bilateral perihilar pulmonary edema has not improved. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. Heart size normal. Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right jugular and right PICC lines both end in the upper right atrium and would need to be withdrawn 2.0 cm for repositioning in the low SVC, if desired.
