CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. No ET tube is identified on the current examination. A right IJ central line is present, tip over distal SVC. There is a moderately large layering right effusion. There is diffuse opacity in the right lung, with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm. While some of this could relate to the layering effusion, I suspect the presence of underlying parenchymal opacities. In addition, there is diffuse patchy increased parenchymal opacity in the left lung. No left-sided effusion. Incidental note is made of mild left convex scoliosis in the lower thoracic spine. Compared with upright film from ___ at 14:32 p.m. and allowing for differences in positioning, I doubt significant interval change.
