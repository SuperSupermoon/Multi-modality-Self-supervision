In comparison to the most recent radiographs, there is increasing left retrocardiac opacity, likely a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, but infection should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. The loculated right pleural effusion with intrafissural component in the major fissure is unchanged with persistent adjacent right basilar lung opacity. A left-sided IJ terminating in the SVC and right basal parenchymal opacities. Again demonstrated is free intraperitoneal air related to the recent G-tube placement. Heart size and hilar contours are stable.
