The endotracheal tube has been advanced in the interim and the tip now is 6.8 cm above the carina at the thoracic inlet. The right IJ approach Swan-Ganz catheter is likely situated at the main pulmonary artery. Remaining support and monitoring devices including bilateral chest tubes, enteric tube, and a mediastinal drainage catheter are unchanged. Median sternotomy wires are again noted. There has been interval increased collapse at the left lung base with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and volume loss. The right lung is essentially clear. No large pneumothorax identified.
