CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Compared with ___, the left chest tube has been removed. A left-sided pigtail remains present, unchanged in position. Much of the left lung apex is obscured by overlying bony structures. No definite pneumothorax identified, but the possibility of a tiny residual pneumothorax would be difficult to exclude. Again seen is upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora and patchy opacities at both bases consistent, with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and possible small left effusion. Allowing for technical differences, the findings in the lungs are quite similar to the prior film. Also again seen are multiple known bilateral fractures.
