Endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and left-sided PICC line are unchanged in position. Study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. However allowing for this, there has been no interval change. There is again seen elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and bilateral pleural effusions. There remains prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothoraces are identified.
