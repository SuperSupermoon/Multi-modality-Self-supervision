There has been no improvement in lung and pleural abnormality since ___. Compared to ___ when chest CT showed multi focal pneumonia moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe collapse, the lungs appear more radiodense today. Some of the could be due to increasing effusions, but I suspect most of it is worsening pneumonia and perhaps the on set of pulmonary edema. Left lower lobe is still collapsed, perhaps the right as well. The heart is mildly enlarged. Azygos distension reflects increased intravascular pressure or volume. ET tube, right PIC line, and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements respectively. No pneumothorax.
