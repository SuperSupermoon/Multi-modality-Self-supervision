A new left subclavian central venous catheter terminates at the mid SVC. The tip of the endotracheal tube remains situated 2.5 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is again seen with the side port canal above the GE junction and should be advanced by at least 9 cm to place the side port below the GE junction. Lung volumes are slightly improved although there is persistent moderate pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
