AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Comparison demonstrates that the previously existing left-sided internal jugular approach central venous line has been removed. The right-sided central venous line remains in unchanged position. No pneumothorax has developed. No new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates can be identified. The previously existing pulmonary vascular congestive pattern has further decreased. The lateral pleural sinuses are free, but the supine position of the patient makes evaluation of pleural effusion impossible.
