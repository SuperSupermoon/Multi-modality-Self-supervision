Patient positioning is suboptimal. There are low lung volumes. Bilateral opacities, right greater than left, and indistinct pulmonary vasculature is compatible with mild to moderate pulmonary edema. There are small pleural effusions, left greater than right. Bibasilar atelectasis is worse on the left with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, likely a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. There is prior median sternotomy with partially visualized intact wires. There is no large pneumothorax.
