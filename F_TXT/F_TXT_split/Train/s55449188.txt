Support and monitoring devices are similar in position with tip of intra-aortic balloon pump about 8 mm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob.

Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities appear similar and most likely represent severe pulmonary edema. Small pleural effusions are unchanged, and there is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
