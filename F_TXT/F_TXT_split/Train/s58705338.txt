There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 4.7 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with side port in the left upper quadrant in the expected location of the stomach, inferior aspect of the tube is not included on the image. The patient is rotated to the left. There has been interval placement of a left subclavian central venous catheter which appears to terminate in the region of the distal SVC/cavoatrial junction; however, the distal aspect of this takes a hairpin turn, which is not typical. This finding was discussed with Dr. ___ at 7:40 p.m. on ___ via telephone. Bilateral layering pleural effusions are seen with associated atelectasis. Perihilar opacities have increased in the interval, which may be due to pulmonary edema. Bilateral pulmonary opacities likely representing combination of pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and atelectasis, although underlying infectious process or aspiration is not excluded.
