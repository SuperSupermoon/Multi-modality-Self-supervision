No previous studies for comparison. There is a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip is in the right atrium. This could be pulled back 3-4 cm for remarkable placement. The side port of nasogastric tube is below the gastroesophageal junction. The tip of the endotracheal tube is 3 cm above the carina. There is increase in pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of pulmonary vascular edema. There are more confluent opacities within the left mid and lower lung fields, which may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or developing consolidation.
