The endotracheal tube is positioned high in the trachea, approximately 9.5 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip in the stomach. A right internal jugular venous catheter is in unchanged position. The lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation. Within the limitations, there are no new opacities, pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum.
