A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a left PICC terminating in the mid to upper SVC. The heart is again at least moderately enlarged. Bilateral diffuse opacities are improved compared to ___, but again could represent mild pulmonary edema or resolving multifocal pneumonia. No new opacity is present. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
