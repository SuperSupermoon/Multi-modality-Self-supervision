There is a right-sided PICC line with the distal lead tip in the mid to distal SVC. There are low lung volumes on the right side with large loculated right-sided pleural effusions with extension to the long apex. This appears unchanged since the prior study. The left lung is well aerated. No pneumothoraces are seen.
