There is opacification of approximately ___ of the left hemithorax with aeration at the left lung apex and a meniscus, suggesting that this is due to a large pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis. Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. There is rightward shift of mediastinal structures. There is a small right pleural effusion and vague opacification of the right lung base, which is improved but not entirely resolved compared to prior. No pneumothorax is detected. Heart size cannot be well evaluated in the setting of overlying left pleural effusion. Aortic knob calcification is seen. The stomach bubble appears to be inferiorly displaced relative to the right hemidiaphragm, suggesting downward mass effect on the left hemidiaphragm by the left pleural process. Pigtail projecting over the right upper quadrant is incompletely imaged.
