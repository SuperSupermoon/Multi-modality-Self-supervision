As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral interstitial opacities have increased in severity and extent. They are now more severe on the left than on the right, with a relatively extensive left lower lobe opacity. The opacity is indicative of a combination of pulmonary edema and infection, as suggested in the previous report. There is no evidence of coexisting complications, such as larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
