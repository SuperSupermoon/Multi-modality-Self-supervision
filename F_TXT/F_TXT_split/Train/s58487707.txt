AP chest compared to ___, 5am: A small bore drainage catheter projects over the right diaphragmatic region, but cannot be localized on this single frontal view. Generalized edema has improved slightly, particularly in the right lower lung since earlier in the day, and there is less pleural fluid on that side. I would strongly recommend conventional chest radiographs if feasible to look for subtle manifestations of pneumothorax. Moderate left pleural effusion is stable or slightly larger since 5 a.m. Heart size is normal. Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
