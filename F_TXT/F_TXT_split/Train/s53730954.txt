There has been interval placement of a left chest tube with tip terminating near the apex. Previously noted large left pneumothorax has substantially reduced in size, with probable small residual pneumothorax noted. Moderate size right pneumothorax is unchanged. There is persistent atelectasis of both lung bases, not substantially changed in the interval. Extensive pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema is re- demonstrated as well as free intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal air within the upper abdomen. Enteric tube tip is coiled within the stomach. Oral contrast material is noted within the stomach. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pulmonary edema is evident. No fractures are identified.
