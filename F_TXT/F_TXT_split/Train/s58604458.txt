The heart is normal in size. There is a new moderate sized hiatal hernia with streaky opacities in the left lower lobe which can probably be attributed to associated atelectasis. In addition, there is a small left-sided pleural effusion. Although a small portion of the right costophrenic sulcus is excluded, there is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right side. There is no free air.
