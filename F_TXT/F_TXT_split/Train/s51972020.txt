Semi erect positioning reduces sensitivity of the chest radiograph for detecting free intraperitoneal air or pneumothorax. Lateral decubitus views may be helpful given clinical suspicion for these entities. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is present as well as large right and moderate left pleural effusions, which have been more fully characterized by recent CTA of the chest 1 day earlier.
