A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube tip is difficult to see, but probably ends at the thoracic inlet. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. Heterogeneous bilateral opacities in the left upper lobe and at the bilateral lung bases are compatible with pneumonia. Prominence of the right hilum is noted. Pulmonary vasculature is normal without evidence of pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No osseous abnormality is identified.
