Tubing from nasal cannula as well as multiple wires from monitoring devices are noted throughout the chest. Overlying the right supraclavicular region there is a small catheter, likely an EJ line. The lungs are well expanded. There is a linear opacity across the right lower lobe which was present on previous exam suggesting scarring/atelectasis. Left basilar atelectasis is unchanged from prior. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. The aorta is tortuous. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Bony structures appear intact.
