There is minimal opacity in the left lower lung which is stable from multiple prior studies, and likely represents scarring or atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
