Compared to the prior film, the left-sided chest tube has been removed. Again seen is the superiorly convex contour, with some associated density, abutting the left hilum in the region of the chain sutures. The degree of associated opacity has improved. This is not clearly a pneumothorax margin, as vessels project beyond it, though it is difficult to exclude some form of loculated pneumothorax in this setting. The density has been postulated to represent hemorrhage at the site of the chain sutures, but is not fully characterized on the basis of this exam. Otherwise, there appears to been some interval clearing of atelectasis at the left lung base. Minimal stranding at both bases remains present, as does slight tenting of the left hemidiaphragm. The right lung is otherwise without focal infiltrate or gross effusion. The minimally displaced fracture of the right ninth rib Lat is unchanged compared with a preop film dated ___ and probably unchanged compared with in chest x-ray from ___. The cardiomediastinal silhouette may be very slightly smaller. Doubt CHF.
