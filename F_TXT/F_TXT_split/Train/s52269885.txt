Comparison is made to previous radiograph performed 10 hours earlier. There is a Swan-Ganz catheter with its lead tip at the main pulmonary artery origin. The endotracheal tube and feeding tube are appropriately sited. There is again seen a left-sided pleural effusion and left atelectasis. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. There are no pneumothoraces.
