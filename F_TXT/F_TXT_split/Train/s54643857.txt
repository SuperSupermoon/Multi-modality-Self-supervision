Pulmonary vascular congestion O was more pronounced on ___. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. There is no mediastinal venous engorgement. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable on the right, increased on the left. A wedge-shaped area of consolidation in the right lower lung is probably unchanged. I am not sure where this is but it is probably chronic atelectasis in the right lower lobe. Remainder of the lungs essentially clear. No pneumothorax. Left PIC line ends in the upper to mid SVC.
