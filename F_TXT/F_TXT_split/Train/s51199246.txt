Right internal jugular large-bore catheter continues to have its tip in the right atrium. The heart remains enlarged and somewhat globular in appearance which may reflect cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion should also be considered. There has been interval improvement in aeration in both lungs with residual multifocal patchy opacities which likely reflect a combination of pulmonary edema and infarcts. The pleural effusions have overall decreased in size. No pneumothorax.
