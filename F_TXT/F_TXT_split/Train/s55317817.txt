A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC. There is persistent visualization of multifocal parenchymal opacities, most confluent in the right mid lung but also affecting the left midlung. There is persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. Although difficult to localize, I suspect there is a small amount of air in the mediastinum. Small left pleural effusion.
