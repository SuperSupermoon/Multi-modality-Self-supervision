Single AP supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a right internal jugular central line. No evidence of pneumothorax. The line appears to terminate within the mid SVC. There is re- demonstration of a right-sided Port-A-Cath which is in unchanged position. Patient is rotated. Allowing for this, overall appearance of bilateral lungs and mediastinal structures is unchanged when compared to chest radiograph obtained 5 hr previously. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted as is low lung volumes. Patchy right perihilar opacity again seen.
