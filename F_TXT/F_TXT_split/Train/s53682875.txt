A chest tube overlies the base of the right lung. There is a small right pleural effusion and adjacent pulmonary opacity at the right base, which likely reflects atelectasis. Multiple rounded opacities are seen throughout both lungs consistent with known pulmonary nodules, better appreciated on recent chest CT from ___. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is no left effusion. Small hydropneumothorax at the right apex.
