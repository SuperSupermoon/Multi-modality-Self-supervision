AP chest compared to ___: Although heart size and mediastinal caliber are normal and unchanged, pulmonary vascular engorgement in the upper lobes has increased. This suggests that the combination of septal lines and more confluent opacity in both lung bases is pulmonary edema. A concurrent pneumonia is a possibility and should be reevaluated after treatment of cardiac decompensation. Left subclavian dual-channel catheter ends in the upper SVC. Small pleural effusions are presumed. No pneumothorax.
