The very small left apical pneumothorax has increased compared with the prior study of ___, now moderate in size. Allowing for rotation there is no apparent midline shift. There are stable atelectatic changes at the left apex and both lung bases. A moderate left pleural effusion is increased with associated compressive atelectasis. The density of the left mid lung likely represents loculated pleural effusion, however consolidation cannot be ruled out. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no pulmonary edema.
