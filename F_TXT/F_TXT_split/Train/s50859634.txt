Following removal of a right-sided chest tube, there is no visible pneumothorax. Moderate right pleural effusion is similar to the prior study, but adjacent atelectasis in right middle and lower lobes has slightly worsened. On the left, patchy and linear atelectasis at the base has slightly improved. Oral contrast is seen within the patient's neoesophagus and also within the tracheobronchial tree consistent with aspiration, more fully documented on separately dictated barium swallow study of the same date. In addition several punctate foci of barium are present lateral to the neoesophagus overlying the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. It is uncertain whether these foci are intraluminal or extraluminal.
