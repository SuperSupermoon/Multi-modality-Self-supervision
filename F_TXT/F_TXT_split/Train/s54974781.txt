Overall, there is improvement compared to most recent study. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in appropriate position. Endotracheal tube ends in the low trachea above the carina. Multiple mediastinal drains are again seen and in place. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Extensive packing material in the mediastinum obscures the view of the other material. The mediastinum is still wide but decreased compared to most recent study. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Likely left pleural effusion layers posteriorly, however, has decreased. Mild pulmonary edema has decreased. Atelectasis in the left lung base and right upper lobe is decreased.
