A single portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. As before, there is a right tunneled internal jugular dialysis catheter, ending in the low right atrium. A right vascular stent projects over the right scapula/clavicle, not significantly changed. A small left pleural effusion may be slightly increased. A small right pleural effusion is not significantly changed. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly persists. The mediastinal contours are normal. Opacification at the right lung base is similar in appearance to prior radiographs and could be atelectasis and/or scarring. No focal consolidations are noted. There is fullness of the pulmonary vasculature without frank pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
