Coarsened interstitial opacities at the lung bases bilaterally are indicative of interstitial lung disease as seen on prior chest CT. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Mediastinal contours are stable, including indentation/rightward shift of the lower trachea by the aortic arch. Increase in density of the right lung base opacity may represent superimposed pneumonia. No large pleural effusion.
