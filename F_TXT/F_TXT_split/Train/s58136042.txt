Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to CT pulmonary embolism that was obtained the same day earlier. Heart size cannot be assessed due to extensive parenchymal consolidation that appears to be overall unchanged as compared to several hours ago. The ET tube tip is 1.8 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
