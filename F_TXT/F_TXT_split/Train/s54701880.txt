Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for low lung volumes. Lungs are grossly clear. Left costophrenic sulcus is not well demonstrated, and the possibility of a small left pleural effusion should be considered. Focal narrowing of the trachea is present at the thoracic inlet, and could reflect a post-intubation edema as the patient has recently been extubated, but intrinsic stenosis is also possible. Attention to this area and short-term followup radiograph is suggested. If persistent, consider CT trachea.
