Following drainage, moderate right pleural effusion has substantially resolved with mild-to-moderate persisting atelectasis and small right pleural effusion. A tiny right apical pneumothorax and small loculated pneumothorax in the right lower lateral lung is present. There are two chest tubes, one reaching all the way till the right apex and another placed at the right lung base. Left lung is clear. Increased coarse hyperdensity in the right hypochondriac and epigastric region is from a prior chemoembolization for a known HCC. Subcutaneous air around the right hemithorax and neck is consistent with recent pleuroscopy and pleurodesis.
