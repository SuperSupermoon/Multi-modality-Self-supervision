The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including cardiac enlargement. There is a persistent pleural effusion on the left, but with substantial decrease.

The left lung apex, as well as the entirety of the right lung ,appear well-aerated and clear, as before. There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right.
