Heart size has increased from the prior study, now appearing mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contour is unchanged. Diffuse alveolar opacities with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness is most compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. Addition a there is a moderate left and small right bilateral pleural effusions, new in the interval. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect compressive atelectasis, but infection or aspiration is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. No pneumothorax is seen. Vascular calcifications are in the region of both axilla. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
