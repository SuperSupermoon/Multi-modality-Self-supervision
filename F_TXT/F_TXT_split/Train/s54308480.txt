Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina. Heart size is normal. Centrally distributed opacities in both lungs are present and were not evident previously in the juxtahilar and basilar portions of the lungs that were included on the prior abdominal CT. Considering the apparent rapidity of development, major differential diagnosis is multifocal aspiration and a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. A component of co-existing atelectasis is likely in the bases. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
