Interval change in pleural catheter with placement of pigtail pleural catheter terminating in the mid right hemithorax. Associated decrease in size of right pneumothorax with residual small-to-moderate apical lateral pneumothorax remaining, with apical visceral pleural line just below the third posterior right rib. Patchy and linear opacities at the lung bases most likely represent atelectasis, and note is made of an apparent small left pleural effusion.
