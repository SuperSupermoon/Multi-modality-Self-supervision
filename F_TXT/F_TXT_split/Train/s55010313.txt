Patient is status post spinal fixation. Multiple monitoring and supporting devices are reidentified, including a right-sided central line ending in the lower SVC, an endotracheal tube ending approximately 5 cm above the carina, and an NG tube which ends below the gastroesophageal junction with the tip out of view. There has been interval removal of a right-sided chest tube, without evidence of pneumothorax. The right lung is clear. In the left lung, there has been interval development of perihilar and lower lung opacities, with obscuration of portions of the right hemidiaphragm margin. An oblong silhouette projecting over the left upper lung is likely external to the patient.
