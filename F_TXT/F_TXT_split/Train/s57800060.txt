In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The patient has taken a slightly better inspiration. Nevertheless, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with relatively mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion would have to be considered. Hazy opacification at the bases could reflect small layering effusions with compressive atelectasis. Patchy area of increased opacification in the right upper zone is consistent with mass with calcification seen on prior CT study.
