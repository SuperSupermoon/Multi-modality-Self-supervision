Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. There may be a right lower lung opacity which could represent pneumonia, however it may also simply be due to patient positioning. IVC is in the inferior cavoatrial junction. Left pleural thickening is better seen on recent CT scan.
