As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Areas of increased radiodensity are seen projecting over the left lung apex, in particular at the level of the ventral part of the first left rib as well as the aortic arch. These areas have not increased in extent and severity as compared to the previous examination. In the interval, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation, with subsequent decrease in extent of a pre-existing right basal atelectasis and a small left retrocardiac atelectasis. No new parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
