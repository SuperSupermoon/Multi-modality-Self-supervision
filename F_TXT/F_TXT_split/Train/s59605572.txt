Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated slightly to the right. There is opacification of most of the right hemithorax with volume loss seen, possibly underlying fluid; underlying consolidation is not excluded. Correlate with history of prior procedure to the right hemithorax. There is a trace left pleural effusion. The right aspect of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well assessed due to the right hemithorax opacity, although the left aspect of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. The left hilum is slightly prominent, which may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement. Single-lead left-sided pacemaker, with lead extending to the expected position of the right ventricle.
