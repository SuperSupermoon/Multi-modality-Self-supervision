Assessment is limited due to positioning. Allowing for this limitation, there is a vague focal opacity in the left lower lung which was not present in prior torso CT. No other focal opacities are identified. Calcified lymph nodes are seen in the left hilum. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Please refer to recent CT for description of no thoracic spine fracture not appreciated in this exam.
