Trachea is slightly more displaced to the right partly caused by the tilted position of the patient and left lower lung atelectasis. Left subclavian dialysis catheter has been removed. Tracheal coronal diameter is narrowed as shown on previous CT. There is no pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is dense opacity projecting in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen measuring 18 mm, possibly in the bowel.
