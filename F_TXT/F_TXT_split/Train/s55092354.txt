Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The left costophrenic angle was not included in the field of view. The imaged portion of the lungs demonstrates overall unremarkable cardiomediastinal silhouette. The lung volumes are low with minimal right basal atelectasis. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No definitive evidence of pneumonia is present. Repeated radiograph might be beneficial for precise characterization of the right lung base.
