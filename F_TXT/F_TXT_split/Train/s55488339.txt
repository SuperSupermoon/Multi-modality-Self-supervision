Single portable AP radiograph through the chest was obtained. This demonstrates clear lungs bilaterally with no focal opacities suggestive of infective process. There has been interval removal of left-sided IJ. Persistent and unchanged prominent right superior mediastinum is identified. The heart appears within normal limits in size. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The right acromioclavicular joint appears slightly widened, stable since prior examination.
