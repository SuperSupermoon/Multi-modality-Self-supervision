There are no prior chest radiographs available for review. It is unclear whether an endotracheal tube is in place. Esophageal drainage tube ends in the stomach and would need to be advanced about 10 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Heart is moderately enlarged, pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature is engorged and mild edema is present in the right lower lobe. Pleural effusion is presumed, but not substantial.
