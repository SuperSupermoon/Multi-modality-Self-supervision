Endotracheal tube terminates 3.9 cm above the level of the carina, in satisfactory position. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, terminating in the left upper quadrant, in the expected position of the stomach, however the side port is at the level of the GE junction. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
