Compared to ___ chest radiograph, asymmetrically distributed bilateral airspace opacities involving the left lung to a greater degree than the right have worsened in the interval. Small right apical pneumothorax is again demonstrated with right pleural catheter in place. Moderate left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion appear increased compared to the recent radiograph, although positional differences limit comparison between the studies.
