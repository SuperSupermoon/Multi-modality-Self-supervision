Patient is rotated somewhat to the left. Enlargement and indistinctness of the hila suggest pulmonary vascular engorgement with probable mild pulmonary edema. Left perihilar opacity is seen. There is plate like left mid lung opacity which may be due to atelectasis/ scarring. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to a small pleural effusion versus pleural thickening/scarring. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are quite enlarged, possibly accentuated by mediastinal lipomatosis as well as AP technique.
