Tip of right PICC terminates in the mid superior vena cava. Heart size is normal. Lungs are clear except for a nonspecific patchy opacity at the right lung base, likely corresponding to a focal area of atelectasis in the right middle lobe on recent CT of one day earlier. Known pleural effusions are seen to better detail on the recent CT.
