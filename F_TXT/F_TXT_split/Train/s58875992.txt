Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance including tortuous and calcified aorta. There is interval improvement in the left perihilar opacity but unchanged right upper lobe opacity, findings that are most likely consistent with resolving pulmonary edema, but right upper lobe consolidation cannot be excluded as a representation of pneumonia. Continued attention to this area is recommended on the subsequent studies.
