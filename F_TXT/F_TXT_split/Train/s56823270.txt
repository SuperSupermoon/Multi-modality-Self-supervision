The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and relative lucency of the lungs consistent with pulmonary emphysema. Fiducial marker is again seen in the right upper lobe. In the right mid lung, there is a 6 mm nodular opacity which represent a pulmonary nodule versus vascular structure. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Old left-sided rib deformities are again seen.
