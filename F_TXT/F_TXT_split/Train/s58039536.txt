Left subclavian central line has its tip in the low SVC, unchanged from the prior examination. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The ET tube is approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. Low lung volumes with bilateral airspace opacities are noted. This is consistent with pulmonary edema, improved since most recent prior examination. Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis; however, pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting. There is no pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly, increased since most recent prior examination.
