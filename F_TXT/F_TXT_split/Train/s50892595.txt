Patient is rotated to the left. There are relatively low lung volumes. Obscuration of the bilateral costophrenic angles may be due to overlying soft tissue, although trace pleural effusions are difficult to exclude. Patchy medial right base opacity has been present over multiple priors and most likely relates to overlying vascular structures although underlying consolidation is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. Aorta knob is calcified. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.
