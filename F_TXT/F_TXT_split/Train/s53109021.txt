Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. Bibasilar opacity, mild and likely reflects atelectasis, though small effusions are impossible to exclude. Patient is rotated to the right, which limits evaluation. Allowing for technical limitations, there is no definite sign of pulmonary edema or new consolidation since prior exam. The heart size cannot be assessed. Bony structures appear intact.
