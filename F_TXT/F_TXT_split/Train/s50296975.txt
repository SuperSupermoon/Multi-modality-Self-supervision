Right basilar chest tube remains projecting over the right basilar hemi thorax. Extensive subcutaneous gas appear slightly increased from the prior study, located within the right lateral chest wall, the neck bilaterally, as well as tracking along the pectoralis muscles bilaterally. No pneumothorax is visualized. Lungs are hyperinflated with marked emphysematous changes again seen in the upper lobes. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Remote fracture of the right mid clavicle is re- demonstrated.
