Single portable supine view of the chest demonstrates relatively low lung volumes. Theendotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.0 cm above the level of the carina, and could be retracted aproximately 1 cm. A nasogastric tube is also seen coursing below the level of diaphragm and out of view. No focal consolidations, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not significantly changed since the prior study.
