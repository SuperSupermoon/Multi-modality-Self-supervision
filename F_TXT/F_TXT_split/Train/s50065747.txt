Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___, read in conjunction with concurrent chest CT, reported separately. Chest CT shows that the substantial increase in the now very large left pleural effusion, probably hemorrhagic, combines with complete occlusion of the left main bronchus by retained secretions to collapse nearly the entire left lung. Moderate right pleural effusion is also larger and right lower lobe atelectasis is more severe than evident on the conventional chest radiograph. There is no pneumothorax. Right PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. Tracheostomy tube is midline.
