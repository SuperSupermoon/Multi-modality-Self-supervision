Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.7 cm above though a chronic area enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the distal stomach. Left base opacity is seen which could be due to aspiration or infection. A small left pleural effusion is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. The right lung is clear. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
