A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter is in place with tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction. A metallic vascular stent is seen projecting superior to the aortic knob which is calcified. Multiple postsurgical changes are present within the lungs, including chain sutures within the righ upper lobe, presumably from prior lobectomy, as well as mediastinal clips in this area. Within the left lung, there is a spiculated mass within the upper lobe, as well as pleural thickening and a large left pleural effusion which obscures the left heart border. Within the right lung, there is perihilar indistinctnes, reflecting mild pulmonary edema. Note is made of surgical clips within the left neck as well. There is slight tracheal deviation, possibly due to enlarged thyroid.
