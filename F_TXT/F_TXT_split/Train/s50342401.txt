There are increasing perihilar and parenchymal opacities consistent with worsening moderate pulmonary edema. There are likely layering bilateral effusions, left greater than right, with persistent retrocardiac consolidation likely reflecting partial lower lobe collapse. Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are stable. Left-sided Port-A-Cath unchanged in position. No large pneumothorax is appreciated.
