There is a left internal jugular central venous catheter which courses across the midline and terminates in the expected location of the right subclavian vein. There is no pneumothorax. Increased linear opacities are seen in the right lung base, compatible with atelectasis superimposed on a background of diffuse chronic interstitial lung disease. Heart size is normal. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Enlarged on the right hilum is compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy, as seen previously.
