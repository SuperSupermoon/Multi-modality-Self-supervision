Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube which terminates in the right mainstem bronchus which needs to be retracted approximately 5 cm to terminate 4 cm above the level of the carina. There is left lower lobe atelectasis/collapse with volume loss on the left, and leftward shift of the mediastinal structures. An orogastric tube courses through the esophagus and below the diaphragm, terminating in the stomach. A catheter tube overlies the left lung base. The right lung is well-expanded with a linear area of atelectasis within the right lung base. There is no pneumothorax. No pleural effusion is present on the right and a small to moderate pleural effusion is present on the left. There is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
