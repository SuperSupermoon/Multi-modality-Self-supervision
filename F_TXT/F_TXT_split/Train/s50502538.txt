AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging: Cardiomegaly is severe. Heterogeneous opacification throughout both lungs, accompanied by right pleural effusion is most easily explained by pulmonary edema, but other possibilities abound such as drug reaction, hemorrhage, or multifocal pneumonia. The transvenous right atrial pacer lead terminates more medial than the expected location of the normal right atrial appendage. It could be in a gigantic right atrium or running through the tricuspid valve toward the pulmonary outflow tract of the right ventricle. No pneumothorax.
