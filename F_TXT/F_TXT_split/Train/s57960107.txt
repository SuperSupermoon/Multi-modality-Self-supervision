The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta appears tortuous, but the aortic knob appears distinct. Widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to technique and low inspiratory volumes. No pulmonary edema, focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or large pneumothorax is present. Multiple bilateral displaced rib fractures are noted involving at least ribs 4 through 8 on the left, and rib 4 on the right.
