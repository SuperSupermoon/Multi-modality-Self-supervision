CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An air-fluid level overlies much of the cardiac silhouette, consistent with a large hiatal hernia. An NG tube extends beneath diaphragm and overlies the mid abdomen, slightly to the left of midline. There is probably background pulmonary hyperinflation. There is moderate cardiomegaly. No overt CHF, frank consolidation or gross effusion. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be present. If there is high concern for the exact configuration of the stomach and hiatal hernia, further assessment with cross-sectional imaging would be recommended.
