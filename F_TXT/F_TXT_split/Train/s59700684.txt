Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube terminating along the upper margin of the clavicles, located no less than 3.5 cm above the carina, appropriate in location. A left basal approach pleural catheter traverses medially with tip terminating at the margin of the mediastinum. The lung volumes remain low, with mildly increased bibasal atelectasis since two days ago, but stable since one day prior. Dense retrocardiac opacities persist, compatible with left lower lobe collapse. A small left pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Mild bronchovascular crowding is accentuated by low lung volume. The heart is top normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
