AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph obtained. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located approximately 3 cm above the carina. NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen with the distal side port at level of the GE junction. A left subclavian central venous catheter is seen with its tip at the level of the superior vena cava. Bilateral chest tubes are in place with the tips approximating the lung apices. No large pneumothorax is seen. There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema involving the chest wall and neck soft tissues. Lower lung opacities likely represent atelectasis. No obvious rib deformity is seen.
