Lung volumes are low which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. Mild pulmonary edema is present with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is incompletely assessed. No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted within the thoracic spine.
