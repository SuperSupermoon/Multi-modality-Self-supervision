Patient is status post median sternotomy. A left-sided pacer device is noted with lead terminating in the right ventricle. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is similar to the previous study. The aorta remains tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable, and the pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
