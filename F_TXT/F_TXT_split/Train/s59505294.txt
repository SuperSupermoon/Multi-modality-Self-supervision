Left-sided pacemaker/AICD device is noted with leads terminating in right ventricle and region of the coronary sinus. There is moderately severe cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires, similar to the prior study. Compared to the prior study, there is new vascular plethora and blurring, consistent with CHF interstitial and possible early alveolar edema. In addition, there is vascular plethora blurring about both hila. There is a small to moderate right effusion, larger than on the prior study. There is atelectasis at the right base and in the right mid zone and the possibility of a subtle infectious infiltrate at the right base cannot be entirely excluded. On the left, there is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, without frank consolidation, significant left base atelectasis or gross effusion. The extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.
