Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours. Patient is intubated with endotracheal tube terminating 2.8 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is coiled within the fundus. Bilateral low lung volumes identified with increased opacification within the right lung base compared to next preceding study, may represent atelectasis, though given unresponsive state, aspiration is a consideration. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.
