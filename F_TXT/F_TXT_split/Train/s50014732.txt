Single AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained. Low lung volumes significantly limit the evaluation. Allowing for this, bronchovascular crowding likely accounts for the relative increase in bronchovascular opacities in the lower lungs. No definite sign of pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with top normal heart size. Bony structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
