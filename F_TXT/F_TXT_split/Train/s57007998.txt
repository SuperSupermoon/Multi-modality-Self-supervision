Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Multifocal poorly defined pulmonary opacities are again demonstrated, with increased confluence in the left upper lobe but improved aeration in the left lower lobe due to a combination of improving pulmonary opacities and apparent decrease of left pleural effusion. Pulmonary and pleural abnormalities on the right appear relatively similar to the prior study. Observed findings in the lungs are in keeping with the history of pneumonia.
