The patient is status post sternotomy. A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device is in place, with leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, as before. An aortic stent graft is partly visualized along the upper abdomen. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Irregular pulmonary architecture is suggestive of emphysema. Scarring is similar at each lung apex including subpleural thickening. There is no evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No free air is demonstrated.
