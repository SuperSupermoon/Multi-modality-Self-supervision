Endotracheal tube remains 2 cm above the carina with the chin in the neutral position and should be retracted to ovoid bronchial intubation. Right and left internal jugular catheters end in the mid SVC. Nasogastric tube ends below the diaphragm but the tip is out of view. Otherwise, there is no change from the prior study with opacification of the right hemithorax. Left basilar opacification is also similar. The left upper lung zone is clear. The right costophrenic angle is excluded from view, but there may be a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
