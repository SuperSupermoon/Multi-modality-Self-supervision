AP portable upright view of the chest. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing 4.4 cm above the carinal. A dextroscoliosis of the T-spine is noted. The heart is prominent though this could be due to supine portable technique. Lungs are clear. No supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax. The bony structures appear intact. Calcification projecting over the heart likely resides within the mitral annulus.
