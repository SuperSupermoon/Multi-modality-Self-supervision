AP chest compared to ___ at 8:19 p.m.: Endotracheal tube is in standard placement. Lung volumes have improved, which may account for improvement in pulmonary edema which is probably responsible for the bulk of airspace opacification in the lungs, although the more intense consolidation in the right upper lobe could be due to concurrent pneumonia. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach. Small left pleural effusion is new or newly apparent, and right pleural effusion is presumed. Although the pleural sulcus is excluded from the examination.
