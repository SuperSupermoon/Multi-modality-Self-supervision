The diameter of the tracheostomy tube cuff is consistently greater than the expected diameter of the trachea, suggesting tracheomalacia. Right PICC ends in the low SVC. NG tube in the decompressed stomach. Complete opacification of the left hemithorax due to left lung collapse is unchanged since at least ___ and has occurred previously. The left margins of the cardiomediastinal silhouette are obscured and the volume of any left pleural effusion is indeterminate. A small right pleural effusion is new or increased.
