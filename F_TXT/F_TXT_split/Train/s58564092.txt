In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. Right pigtail catheter remains in place and there has been no reaccumulation of pleural fluid. No pneumothorax is appreciated. There is some increasing opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm. This is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lung and possible small effusion. Monitoring and support devices are otherwise unchanged.
