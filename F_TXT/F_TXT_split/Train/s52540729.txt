Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged accompanied by pulmonary vascular engorgement, perihilar haziness and peripheral septal lines, consistent with widespread pulmonary edema. More confluent, asymmetrically distributed opacities in the lower lobes, right greater than left, may reflect asymmetrically distributed dependent edema, but followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful to exclude a pneumonia in the right lower lobe given clinical concern for infection. Small-to-moderate right and small left pleural effusion are also noted.
