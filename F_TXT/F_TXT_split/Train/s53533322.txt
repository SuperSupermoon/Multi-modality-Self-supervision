As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of very low lung volumes with a tracheostomy tube and the left PICC line. Alignment of sternal wires is constant. There are substantial bilateral pleural effusions, potentially minimally increasing on the left. Signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema continue to be present. The extent of the bilateral basal areas of atelectasis is constant. No new parenchymal opacities.
