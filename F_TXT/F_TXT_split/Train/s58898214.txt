Comparison is made prior to ___. There is a questionable tiny right pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Bibasilar atelectasis larger on the left side have increased. If any there are small bilateral pleural effusions. Radiolucent seen in the medial aspect of the upper and mid left hemithorax likely represents air in the pericardium and pneumomediastinum. Sternal wires are aligned. Of note, there is still present two pacer leads but they appear to end both in the right atrium. Prior ICD located the right ventricle is not longer visualized.
