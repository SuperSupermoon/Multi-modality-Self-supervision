Previously right lower lobe has substantially re-expanded. consolidation in that region may be transient, due to residual atelectasis and re-expansion edema, but should be followed to exclude developing pneumonia. Heart size has increased, but still normal and there is greater distention of mediastinal veins and pulmonary vasculature, all pointing to increased intravascular volume. No pneumothorax.
