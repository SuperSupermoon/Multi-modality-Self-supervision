Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. There is mild pulmonary edema, similar compared to the most recent exam. Small left pleural effusion is likely present. There is no pneumothorax identified. Evaluation of the extreme lung apices is obscured due to the patient's chin overlying this region. No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
