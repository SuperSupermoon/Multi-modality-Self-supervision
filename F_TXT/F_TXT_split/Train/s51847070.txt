No previous images. Left chest tube is in place and there is opacification at the left base consistent with pleural fluid and atelectatic change. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. No definite evidence of pneumothorax. There is hyperexpansion of the lungs suggesting chronic pulmonary disease in this patient with a previous CABG and dual-channel pacer. Of incidental note are several old healed rib fractures on the right.
