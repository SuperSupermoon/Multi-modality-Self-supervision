As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices including the endotracheal tube, are in unchanged position. Unchanged mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly, with retrocardiac atelectasis. The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No other new parenchymal opacities, notably none suggesting pneumonia.
