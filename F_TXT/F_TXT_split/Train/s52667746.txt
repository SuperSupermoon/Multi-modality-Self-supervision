AP chest compared to subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and mild pneumomediastinum presumably reflect recent esophageal surgery. There is no appreciable mediastinal widening and no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Lung volumes are quite low reflected in bibasilar atelectasis and responsible for pulmonary vascular crowding. I doubt there is pulmonary edema. Heart size is normal. Nasogastric tube passes into the upper abdomen and out of view passing a surgical drain. No pneumothorax.
