Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient's chin obscures the lung apices, particularly the right lung apex, obscuring the view. There are low lung volumes. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. The bones are diffusely osteopenic, making evaluation for subtle fracture suboptimal.
