There is mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette. Bilateral hilar enlargement is present. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Moderate pulmonary edema is demonstrated with vascular indistinctness, and small bilateral pleural effusions. Opacification of the lung bases likely reflects compressive atelectasis although pneumonia is not excluded. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
