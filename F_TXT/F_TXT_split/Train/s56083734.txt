A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea and enteric tube terminating in the stomach. A left PICC has been repositioned, now terminating in the mid to low SVC. Heart size remains moderately enlarged. Retrocardiac atelectasis and mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Right pleural fluid is minimal, if any. Lucency along the left upper lung is likely related to an overlying skin fold.
