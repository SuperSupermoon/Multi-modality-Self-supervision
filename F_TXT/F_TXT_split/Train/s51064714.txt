A right chest tube is present at the right lung base. The appearance is not suggestive of a conventional pigtail catheter. Small area of hazy opacity at the right lung base could reflect a combination of atelectasis and minimal pleural fluid. No gross effusion is identified. Of note, there is a small right apical pneumothorax. On the left, there is minimal pleural fluid and minimal basilar atelectasis. No left apical pneumothorax. Borderline upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not enlarged. Background COPD again noted.
