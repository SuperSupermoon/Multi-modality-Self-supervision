Endotracheal tube terminates 3.6 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of view. Streaky right base opacity is worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration versus atelectasis given adjacent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The left lung is grossly clear. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged, likely exaggerated by AP technique. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
