Indwelling support and monitoring devices are remarkable for removal of right subclavian catheter with no visible pneumothorax. Tip of left subclavian catheter is directed towards the lateral wall of superior vena cava, without change. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly improved from the prior exam. Left perihilar haziness probably reflects asymmetrical edema, but radiographic followup would be helpful to exclude a developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
