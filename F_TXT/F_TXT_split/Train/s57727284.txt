In comparison to the prior radiograph performed less than 1 hr ago, there has been no significant interval change in positioning of the nasogastric tube, which terminates in the distal stomach/ proximal duodenum. Bronchovascular markings are slightly accentuated by low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis, although infection could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. No substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
