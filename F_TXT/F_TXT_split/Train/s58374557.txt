Compared with the immediate prior radiographs, there is little change. Large layering right pleural effusion, severe pulmonary edema, and moderate cardiomegaly are unchanged. There may be slight improvement in left-sided opacities, compatible with either edema or atelectasis, although superimposed consolidation cannot be ruled out. A left IJ Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. A right subclavian central venous catheter tip ends in the right atrium, and a left IJ introduction sheath ends at the level of the left brachiocephalic vein. Endotracheal tube ends 5.6 cm from the carina and the enteric tube and side port end within a decompressed stomach. The right basilar pleural drain is in unchanged position.
