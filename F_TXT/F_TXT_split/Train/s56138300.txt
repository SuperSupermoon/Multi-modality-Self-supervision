Bilateral extensive heterogeneous opacities throughout the lungs consistent with aspiration have improved on the right and worsened on the left. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. The mediastinum is widened, mediastinal lymph nodes were better seen on prior CT. Biapical pleural thickening is asymmetric larger on the right, stable. Denser consolidation in the left lower lobe could be atelectasis or a larger area of aspiration. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
