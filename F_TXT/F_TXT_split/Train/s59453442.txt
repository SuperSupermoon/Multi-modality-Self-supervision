The lungs are well expanded. There is interval development of asymmetric mild pulmonary edema, right greater than left. Alternatively, this could be a symmetric pulmonary edema with a right lower lobe pneumonia, but this is less likely. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
