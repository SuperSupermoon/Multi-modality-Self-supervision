Lung volumes are low which result in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Linear opacities at the right base are most likely atelectasis. There is blunting of the costophrenic angles, slightly worse on the left, possibly due to small pleural effusions or pleural thickening. A curvilinear thin radio-opaque density, possibly a wire, is seen projecting over the right hilus. An apparent inferior epicardial wire is unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the prior study with mild cardiomegaly. A large hiatal hernia is present. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Osseous structures are intact.
