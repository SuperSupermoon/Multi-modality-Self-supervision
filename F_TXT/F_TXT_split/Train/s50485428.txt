Supine portable chest radiograph was obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates in the mid trachea. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of view. Right internal jugular catheter terminates in the upper SVC. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Increasing bibasilar opacities could be due to hypoventilation resulting in atelectasis; however aspiration should be considered. Cardiac size and mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
