A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates mediastinal fiducials with decreased size of right mediastinal prominence, as well as interval placement of an enteric tube which terminates in the distal esophagus. This can be advanced approximately 12 cm to place the side hole beyond the gastroesophageal junction. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is mild pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is appreciated. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
