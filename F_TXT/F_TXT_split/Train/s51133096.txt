As compared to the previous image, no relevant change is seen. Moderate cardiomegaly. Retrocardiac and right basilar atelectasis. Low lung volumes, no pneumonia on the current radiograph. Slightly increased density zone at the right lung bases is likely caused by patient rotation. No pleural effusions.
