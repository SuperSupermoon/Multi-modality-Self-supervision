1. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position, although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not visualized on the current study. There are layering bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, most likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Low volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning and technique. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
