1. The right chest tube remains in place. There is a stable small right apical pneumothorax. Post-operative changes in the right hemithorax with associated volume loss are unchanged. There is a layering left effusion with associated retrocardiac opacity most likely reflecting partial lower lobe compressive atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given differences in patient positioning. Interval decrease in gas within the right neck soft tissues.
