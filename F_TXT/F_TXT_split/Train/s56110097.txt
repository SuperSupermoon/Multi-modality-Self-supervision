Compared to most recent prior exam, there has been no significant interval change. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and mild interstitial edema persist. Bibasilar atelectasis persists. Heart and mediastinal contours are similar. Right internal jugular, left internal jugular, esophageal catheter, and endotracheal tube are similarly positioned, with endotracheal tube tip approximately 5 cm above the carina just above the level of the clavicles. No pneumothorax is detected on this view.
