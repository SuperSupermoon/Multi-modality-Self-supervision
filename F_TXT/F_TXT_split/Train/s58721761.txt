There are low lung volumes. This slightly limits assessment of lung bases where there are streaky opacities likely reflecting atelectasis. The heart size is top normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted. Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
