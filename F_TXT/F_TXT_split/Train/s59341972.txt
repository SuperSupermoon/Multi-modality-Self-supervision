Tiny right-sided pneumothorax seen on cervical spine CT earlier this same date is not well appreciated on chest radiograph. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Chronic deformity of the right mid clavicle is seen which may be from prior trauma.
