In comparison with the earlier study of this date, little change in the appearance of the endotracheal tube, which is positioned just above the clavicles and could be pushed forward. PICC line is unchanged. Again there is soft tissue gas in the left supraclavicular region. The gas previously seen along the left heart border is difficult to demonstrate, though this may be due to the relative obliquity of the patient rather than to any improvement. Indeed, there is a suggestion of a similar outer margin adjacent to the lower left heart border that is not as well seen as previously. No evidence of pneumothorax. There also appears to be a small amount of subcutaneous gas along the upper chest wall on the right.
