Pulmonary edema is mild and heart size is top- normal. Most of the opacification in the chest is due to persistent pleural effusion, moderate to large on the right, smaller on the left and atelectasis, most pronounced in the left lower lobe. There has not been much change over the past several days. ET tube tip at the thoracic inlet approximately 6 cm from the carina is acceptable position. Two esophageal catheters, one a feeding tube and the other probably a drain pass below the diaphragm and out of view. Right jugular line ends in the right brachiocephalic vein, just above the origin of the SVC. A left jugular catheter ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax.
