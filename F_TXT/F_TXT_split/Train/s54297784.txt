1. Right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. Status post median sternotomy. The heart remains markedly enlarged, most likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded. There continues to be more focal patchy opacity in the right mid and lower lung, which may reflect areas of patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. A more focal nodular opacity in the left mid lung is once again apparent and may represent an area of loculated fluid or patchy atelectasis. There is cephalization of the vasculature consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension, but no overt pulmonary edema is present at this time. No large pleural effusions. Retrocardiac streaky opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
