Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Interval removal of the endotracheal tube, right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, mediastinal and pleural tubes and nasogastric tube. Patchy retrocardiac opacity likely reflects partial lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of a small effusion. Interval decrease in pneumopericardium. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema.
