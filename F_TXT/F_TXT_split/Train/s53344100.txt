CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.No previous ___ radiographs on PACS record for comparison. Rotated positioning. The patient is status post sternotomy. There is marked cardiomegaly. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is slight patchy increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. No gross effusion identified. A right-sided dual-lead pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle. Rounded density overlying the right upper quadrant noted. Is there an iatrogenic structure, eg, G-tube balloon to account for this ?
