In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. Continued low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. There is increased opacification at the right base with silhouetting hemidiaphragm. This could reflect pleural fluid and atelectatic changes. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. As on multiple previous studies, there is a peripherally calcified rounded density projecting over the liver.
