There are diffuse heterogeneous opacities in the bilateral lung fields, more prominent in the perihilar distribution. There is also moderate cardiomegaly. Hilar and mediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be ruled out due to overlying opacities. There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature.
