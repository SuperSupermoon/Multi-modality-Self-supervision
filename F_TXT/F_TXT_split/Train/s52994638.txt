In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in satisfactory position. There is some improved aeration at the left base and decreased fluid loculating along the left lateral chest wall. Apical opacification on the left persists. The right lung is essentially clear except for small area of opacification at the base. This most likely reflects atelectasis, though aspiration would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
