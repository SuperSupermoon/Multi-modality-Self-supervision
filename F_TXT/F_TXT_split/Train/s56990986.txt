The trachea is poorly delineated. Allowing for this, the tip of the ET tube lies approximately 4.6 cm above the carina. An NG type tube is present, extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film. A right IJ central line is again seen, tip overlying mid SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Allowing for low lung volumes, no definite CHF. Bibasilar atelectasis. No gross effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
