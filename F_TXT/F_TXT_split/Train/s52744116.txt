Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates hypoinflated lungs with crowding of vasculature and right lower lobe atelectasis. No focal opacity. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is top-normal due to patient positioning and low lung volumes. Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable. Curvilinear lucency along the right hemidiaphragm is most consistent with atelectasis.
