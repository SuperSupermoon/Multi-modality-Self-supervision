A right IJ central catheter is again noted, unchanged from prior exam. The lungs are well expanded. There is generalized pulmonary edema. A right lower lobe consolidation is seen, which may represent atelectasis. There is a right pleural effusion. Cardiomegaly is increased from prior exam. Pulmonary vascular engorgement is seen, without frank edema. Persistent opacity in the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, have decreased slightly from the prior exam. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
