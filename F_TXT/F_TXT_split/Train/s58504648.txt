Lung volumes are low, accentuating the bronchovascular structures and limiting assessment of the cardiovascular status of the patient. Although mild pulmonary vascular congestion may be present, there are no areas of interstitial or alveolar opacities to suggest the presence of pulmonary edema.

Calcifications are present along both hemidiaphragms and appear to be intra-abdominal rather than pleural on prior CT abdomen of ___.
