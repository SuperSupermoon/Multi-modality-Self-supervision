Tracheostomy tube remains in place. A left subclavian PICC line has its tip at the cavoatrial junction unchanged. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the stomach with the tip not identified. Left chest tube remained unchanged in position with its tip at the apex. Left subcutaneous emphysema of the chest wall is not as well visualized on the current examination due to differences in positioning. There is focal airspace consolidation with an associated blunted left costophrenic angle noted at the left base, which likely reflects progression of partial lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of a pleural effusion, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning.
