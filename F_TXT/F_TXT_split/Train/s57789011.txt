A right-sided PICC is in-situ, unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study. Precise localization of the tip is not possible as in the cardiomediastinal contour is obscured by right middle and lower lobe atelectasis. There is persistent prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild congestive heart failure. No frank pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax seen.
