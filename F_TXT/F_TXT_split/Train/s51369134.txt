Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Lungs are grossly clear with no new areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia allowing for overlap of structures in the left juxtamediastinal region due to patient's rotation. If strong clinical suspicion for pulmonary infection persists, repeat non-rotated radiograph may be helpful to more fully evaluate this region.
