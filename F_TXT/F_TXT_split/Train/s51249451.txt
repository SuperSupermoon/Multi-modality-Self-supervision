As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of pulmonary edema have decreased in severity. The monitoring and support devices are constant, except for the hemodialysis catheter that has been removed. The patient now has bilateral small pleural effusions as well as bilateral areas of basal atelectasis. The atelectasis is more severe on the left than on the right. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No evidence of pneumothorax.
