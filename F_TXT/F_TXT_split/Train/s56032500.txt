Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Worsening opacities are present at both lung bases, and are accompanied by slightly increasing small pleural effusions. Etiology for the lung parenchymal abnormalities is uncertain, but could be due to atelectasis, aspiration, or developing infectious pneumonia. Followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
