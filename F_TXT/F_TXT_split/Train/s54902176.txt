As compared to prior studies, the left lung demonstrates longstanding diffuse homogeneous opacities characterized as ground glass infiltrations on prior chest CT which appear stable and unchanged. Somewhat heterogeneous opacities on the right have evolved, with increased consolidations in the lateral aspect of the right lung. This process seems to fluctuate on day-to-day basis, based on concurrent cardiac function. These findings may be related to pneumonitis, less likely an infection, and raises the possibility of a drug reaction and/or toxic exposure.
