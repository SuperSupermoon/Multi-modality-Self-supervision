AP chest compared to ___: Previous asymmetric pulmonary edema continues to improve. Mild cardiomegaly stable and small bilateral pleural effusions have increased. I am not entirely sure whether the residual consolidation at the lung bases, particularly the right, is simply residual edema and atelectasis or whether there was a component of pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. No pneumothorax.
