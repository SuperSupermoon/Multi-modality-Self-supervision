Single portable view of the chest. No prior. Right IJ line is identified with tip in the proximal right atrium. There is no visualized right apical pneumothorax. No definite left pneumothorax. There is, however, horizontal line at the left lung base suggesting air-fluid level, raising possibility of hydropneumothorax. Alternatively, this could be due to relatively flat diaphragm and effusion. Mild blunting seen at the right cardiophrenic angle as well. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch. Mitral annular calcification is also noted.
