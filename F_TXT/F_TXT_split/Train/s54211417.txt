Lung volumes are substantially lower today despite new intubation, ET tube in standard placement. Poor definition of the airway lumens is not a new finding, but does raise concern for retained secretions, and there is considerable new atelectasis at both lung bases, left greater than right. Pleural effusions small if any. No pneumothorax. Severe cardiomegaly is exaggerated by lower lung volumes. Right PIC line ends low in the right atrium. Nasogastric drainage tube ends in the upper portion of a nondistended stomach.
