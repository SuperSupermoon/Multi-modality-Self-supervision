A left chest wall Port-A-Cath is present, the tip projecting over the cavoatrial junction. There is new elevation of right hemidiaphragm with hazy opacities projecting throughout the mid to lower right lung zones possibly reflecting combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis/ consolidation. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified in the left lung. The size of the cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.
