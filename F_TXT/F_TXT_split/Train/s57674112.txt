AP chest compared to ___: Atelectasis in the left lung base above the severely elevated abdominal contents has improved. The gas collection projecting to the left of the cardiac silhouette is in a hollow viscus. Either the left hemidiaphragm remains markedly elevated or there is still substantial herniation of abdominal contents into the left chest. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable, but the degree of rightward mediastinal shift which was most pronounced prior to hernia repair is less pronounced today. Mediastinal vasculature is engorged and there is a small left pleural effusion, but no pulmonary edema. The esophageal drain ends above the plane of abdominal contents in the left hemithorax, unchanged since the earliest postoperative studies. Right jugular line ends low in the SVC. If there is uncertainty as to the position of the left hemidiaphragm or status of the previous diaphragmatic hernia, CT scanning is recommended, but determining the function of the diaphragm would require either ultrasound or fluoroscopy.
