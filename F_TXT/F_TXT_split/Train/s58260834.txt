Overall, there has been no significant interval change of the diffuse nodular and patchy bilateral airspace opacity compared to the prior exam performed at 4:35 p.m. on the same day. The mediastinum overall appears widened. There is a right-sided internal jugular line with the tip in the mid SVC. The aortic knob again appears to be calcified.
