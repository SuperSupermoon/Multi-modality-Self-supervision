AP chest compared to ___ and chest radiographs from ___: ___ opacification in the right mid and lower lung zones has worsened, while background interstitial pulmonary edema has improved, strongly suggestive of probably pneumonia. Of note the pulmonary interstitium has been consistently abnormal in the past, raising the possibility of a baseline interstitial lung disease which should be evaluated after clearing of the current cardiopulmonary abnormality. Heart size is normal and mediastinal veins are not dilated. Pleural effusion is small on the right, if any. No pneumothorax.
