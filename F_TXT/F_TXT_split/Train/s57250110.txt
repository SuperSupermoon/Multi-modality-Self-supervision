AP chest compared to ___: A transient pulmonary edema on the ___ and ___ has resolved and not recurred, though heart remains substantially enlarged. Pleural effusions are small if any. The residual opacification at the base of the left lung could be a combination of remaining edema and atelectasis but raises concern for early pneumonia and should be followed closely. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements respectively. The upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach but should be advanced at least 8 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction. No pneumothorax.
