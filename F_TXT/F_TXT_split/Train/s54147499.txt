Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. There is continued interval improvement of the large left upper lobe pneumonia. Increased opacification of the left base may represent atelectasis, however pneumonia can be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. There is a small right-sided pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. A left-sided PICC line ends in the distal SVC. A granuloma in the right upper lung is unchanged.
