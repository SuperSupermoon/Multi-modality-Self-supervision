On a bedside, semi-upright chest radigraph, the cardiomediastinal silhouette has the expected postoperative appearance. Lung volumes are low. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Moderate, dependent right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis are slightly larger since the prior study. Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.
