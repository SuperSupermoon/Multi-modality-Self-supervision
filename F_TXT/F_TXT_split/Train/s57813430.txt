LEFT PICC HAS CHANGED IN POSITION, NOW MAKING AN ABRUPT SUPERIOR AND MEDIAL TURN AT THE LEVEL OF THE RIGHT TRACHEOBRONCHIAL ANGLE. PRECISE POSITIONING OF THE CATHETER IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE ON THE SINGLE VIEW, BUT IT IS MOST LIKELY LOCATED WITHIN THE AZYGOS VEIN. ALTERNATIVELY, IT COULD BE COILED WITHIN THE LEFT BRACHIOCEPHALIC VEIN. LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH WOULD BE HELPFUL TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THESE LOCATIONS. EXAM IS OTHERWISE REMARKABLE FOR LINEAR BIBASILAR ATELECTASIS, SLIGHTLY IMPROVED ON THE RIGHT.
