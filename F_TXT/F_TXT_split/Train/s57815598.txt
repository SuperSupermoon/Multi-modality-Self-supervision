AP single view of the chest was provided. All the monitoring devices are unchanged and in standard position. Lung volume is still low, with interval increase of lower lung opacification for increased dependent lung edema. Heart size is minimally larger since prior CXR, this interval increase might be due to pericardial effusion. Minimal enlargement of the upper mediastinal border is normal postoperative appearance after cardiac surgery. There is a new, small left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Focal atelectasis in the periphery of the right upper lobe is stable. Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.
