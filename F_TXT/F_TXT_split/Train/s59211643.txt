Compared with the immediate prior study of ___, pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular congestion have improved, both now mild. The right hilum is persistently enlarged, but looks arterial perhaps due to left heart failure. The previous left-sided nodule is not appreciated on the present study. Conventional PA and lateral radiographs will be helpful for further assessment when clinically feasible. There may be a small left pleural effusion. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The heart is stably top-normal in size.
