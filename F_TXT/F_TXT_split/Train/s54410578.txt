The ET tube and right IJ central venous line are in appropriate position. The gastric tube ends outside the view of this radiograph. The bilateral hilar continue to be enlarged secondary to known lymphadenopathy as seen on CT scan. Lung volumes continue to be low, and the left hemidiaphragm is obscured secondary to volume loss. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
