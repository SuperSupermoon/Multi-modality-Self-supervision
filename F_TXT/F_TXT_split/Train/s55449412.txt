AP chest compared to ___: Upper enteric drainage tube has been withdrawn into the chest. Either the patient has had a gastric pull-up or the esophagus is distended. There is no dilated stomach in the abdomen. A second drainage catheter, presumably percutaneous, crosses the midline at the level of the liver edge. Left lower lobe is densely consolidated, presumably atelectasis. Upper bowel loops which previously projected over the cardiac silhouette are now opacified, presumably full of fluid. There is no pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion is likely. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged, and moderate cardiomegaly persists. No pneumothorax. Both shoulders are severely degenerated.
