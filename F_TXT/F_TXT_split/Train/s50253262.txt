Compared to ___ radiograph, the patient has been intubated with tip of endotracheal tube in standard position. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by worsening asymmetrically distributed bilateral perihilar and basilar confluent opacities, right greater than left. Although potentially due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema, superimposed aspiration or evolving infectious pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Note is also made of bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left.
