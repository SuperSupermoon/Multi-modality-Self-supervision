Lung volumes are low with bronchovascular crowding. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and slight indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature suggesting mild edema. The heart size is difficult to fully assess in the setting of low lung volumes and is AP view and is probably normal in size. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The mediastinum is not widened. No evidence of fractures on this nondedicated exam.
