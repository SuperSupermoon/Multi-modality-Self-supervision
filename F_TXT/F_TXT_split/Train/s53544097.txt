A portable semi-erect AP chest radiograph was obtained. There is cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, as well as a right pleural effusion. No clear focal consolidation is seen, although pulmonary edema makes it difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax or intra-abdominal air is identified. There is no bony abnormality.
