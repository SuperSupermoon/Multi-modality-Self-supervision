Bilateral chest tubes remain in place. Prominent lucency adjacent to side port of left chest tube may represent a loculated pneumothorax, and note is made of a known moderate-sized anterior pneumothorax on recent CT of one day earlier, which likely corresponds to this finding. Adjacent left pleural effusion is small to moderate and atelectasis in lingula and left lower lobe are substantial. Heterogeneous opacities in the right lung have worsened in the interval and are probably due to multifocal pneumonia.
