Again seen is a right basilar opacity silhouetting the right cardiac margin. There is also a retrocardiac opacity as well. Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally suggests persistent bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right as seen on prior. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable. Right sided central venous catheter is again noted. No acute osseous abnormalities.
