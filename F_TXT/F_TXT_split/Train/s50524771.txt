Frontal view shows a new left pleural drain extending from the surface of the elevated left hemidiaphragm laterally to the near apex of the left hemithorax. Previous small pleural effusion has been evacuated, with a small pneumothorax roughly equal in volume in its place. Left perihilar mass and upper lobe atelectasis are probably unchanged. Right lung clear. Heart size normal. Dr. ___ was paged at 1:00 p.m., one minute following recognition of the findings.
