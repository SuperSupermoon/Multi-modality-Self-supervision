Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The aorta remains unfolded with aortic knob calcifications again seen. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are most likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
