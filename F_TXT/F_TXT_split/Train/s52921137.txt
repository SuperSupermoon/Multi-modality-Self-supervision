Pleural catheters remain in place in the right hemithorax, with small right pleural effusion and adjacent basilar atelectasis, but no visible pneumothorax. Left chest tube also remains in place, with persistent small left effusion. Other support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal widening is unchanged. Slight improved aeration in the region of atelectasis in the left retrocardiac area, but otherwise no relevant short interval change since the recent radiograph performed earlier the same date.
