Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. The interpretation of this study is limited. The patient is rotated. Allowing these limitations, vascular congestion has improved. Bibasilar atelectases have improved. There is no pneumothorax. There are no new lung abnormalities. If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are stable. The ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter shift could be seen in the upper SVC. NG tube tip is not well visualized.
