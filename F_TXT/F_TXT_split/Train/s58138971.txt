Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.4 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is noted which courses below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach and off the inferior borders of the film. Heart size is normal. The aortic knob is calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Streaky opacity in the left lower lobe likely reflects atelectasis. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus may suggest a trace pleural effusion. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
