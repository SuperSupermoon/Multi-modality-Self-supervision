AP chest compared to ___:22 p.m. The obliquely oriented right pleural tube has been withdrawn to the point where most proximal side port is probably at the intercostal plane, explaining new subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall along side. Substantial atelectasis persists at the right lung base. Previous interstitial edema has improved. Heart size is top normal, exaggerated by very low lung volumes. No definite pneumothorax. Right pleural effusion is stable, and probably not large. The stomach is moderately distended with gas.
