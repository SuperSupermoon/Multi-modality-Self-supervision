Please note that the right lung apex is excluded from this image. Lung volumes are very low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding and exaggerating mediastinal contours. The heart does not appear enlarged. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, consolidation. A right internal jugular central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction.
