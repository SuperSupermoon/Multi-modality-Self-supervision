AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting upright position. Available for comparison are the next two preceding portable chest examinations of ___ and ___. In comparison with the next preceding study, the patient has now been extubated. No pneumothorax has developed. Again noted is a rather sizable parenchymal infiltrate in the left lower lung field similar to what has been shown on previous examinations as well as an initial chest CT of ___. These densities are compatible with aspiration pneumonitis given patient's history. There is probably some mild cardiac enlargement, but the portable examination and the uncooperative patient added to makes it difficult to establish clear findings. There is no congestive pulmonary vascular pattern in the accessible areas. Lateral pleural sinuses are free, which excludes larger pleural effusions. As on previous examination, there is evidence of an anterior cephalization plate overlying the lower cervical spine area.
