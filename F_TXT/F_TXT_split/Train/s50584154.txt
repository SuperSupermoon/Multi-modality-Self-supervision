Two chest tubes overlying the right hemi thorax, unchanged in position from the prior study. There is a very small right apical pneumothorax. No large pleural effusion is identified. There is mild atelectasis at the right base. A paramedial opacity on the right could represent a small hematoma or pleural collection which is decreasing in size from the prior exam. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. The heart is enlarged however stable in appearance from the prior exam. Note is made of subcutaneous air along the right chest wall consistent with recent procedure.
