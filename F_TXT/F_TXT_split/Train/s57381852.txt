Mild pulmonary edema has worsened. Lung volumes remain quite low suggesting bibasilar opacification could be a combination of edema and atelectasis, but pneumonia is not excluded, particularly on the left. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. Mediastinal venous engorgement is unchanged. No pneumothorax.
