AP chest compared to ___: The questioned right lower lung abnormalities obscured by a new moderate right pleural effusion. Left lung is clear. Heart is moderately-to-severely enlarged. Thoracic aorta is generally large and heavily calcified. No pneumothorax. Therefore, what could have been either a small pneumonia or new pulmonary infarction cannot be assessed by conventional radiographs. I discussed these findings by telephone with Dr. ___ at the time of dictation. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard positions, unchanged.
