A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates that the right-sided pneumothorax is now much smaller, seen as a pleural line only in the apex. The right-sided chest tube is unchanged in position. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged in size; however, it no longer presents as a distinct air-fluid level, also supporting the interval decrease in amount of the pleural air. The lungs are otherwise clear. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
