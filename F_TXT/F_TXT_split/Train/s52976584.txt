AP chest compared to ___: Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened and small right pleural effusion has developed. Upper lungs are clear and there is no pulmonary edema or consolidation there. Heart is largely obscured by elevated hemidiaphragm but probably enlarged. Gaseous distention of bowel loops in the left upper quadrant has worsened appreciably, probably contributing to diminished excursion of the left hemidiaphragm.
