Lung volumes are low resulting in bronchovascular crowding. However, there is new consolidation within the right lung base which is concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. Opacity within the retrocardiac region is similar to prior and likely reflects chronic infection as seen on prior chest CT. Upper lungs are clear. There is no large pleural effusion. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Mild widening of the cardiac silhouette is likely secondary to the AP technique.
