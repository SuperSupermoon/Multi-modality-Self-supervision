There is no recurrence of the right pleural effusion nor is there a left pleural effusion. A tiny linear density at the right apex may represent a small apical pneumothorax. Left-sided pacer leads are in the standard position. A median sternotomy wire and CABG clips are noted. There is obscuration of the right heart border that most likely represents atelectasis in the right middle lobe though pneumonia cannot be completely excluded. Cardiac size is within normal limits. The case was discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ by phone at 12:01 p.m. on ___.
