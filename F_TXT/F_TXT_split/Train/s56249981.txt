In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the position of the transvenous pacer, the tip of which appears to be in the region of the apex of the right ventricle. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there may be minimal engorgement of pulmonary vessels. Relative opacification of the left base could reflect pleural fluid or technical artifact. Of incidental note are surgical clips overlying the outer aspect of the lower left chest, most likely related to the breast.
