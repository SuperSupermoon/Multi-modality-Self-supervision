Single supine view of the chest. Endotracheal tube is seen with tip 5 cm from the carina. Feeding tube passes off the inferior field of view. Vague linear right basilar opacity is most suggestive of atelectasis. Elsewhere the lungs are grossly clear and the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Likely chronic deformity of the lateral right clavicle. Potentially acute deformity of the proximal left humerus is incompletely visualized.
