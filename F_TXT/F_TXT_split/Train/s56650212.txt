Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates increased pleural effusion with atelectasis and/or consolidation in the left lung base. A circumscribed thick-walled cavitary lesion measuring 4.7 cm in the left mid lung is similar as compared to prior exams and well correlated to a large pulmonary abscess on preceding CT from one day prior. The left upper lung and right lung appear relatively well aerated. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits allowing for low lung volumes and AP technique.
