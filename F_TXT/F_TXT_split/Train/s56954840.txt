Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. Bilateral chest tubes have been readjusted. Left pneumothorax is small. Right basal small pneumothorax is unchanged. Right mid lung atelectasis is new. Increasing opacity in the right upper lobe could be atelectasis or aspiration. Worsening opacity and shifting of the cardiomediastinum towards the left is associated with probably collapse of the left lower lobe. Moderate vascular congestion has improved. Other lines and tubes are in unchanged positions.
