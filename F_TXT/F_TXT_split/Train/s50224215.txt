Endotracheal tube has been re-positioned, now terminating 2.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach. Lung volumes are very low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Worsening pulmonary opacities are present within the left perihilar and basilar region with some apparent air bronchograms. Differential diagnosis for this finding includes asymmetrical pulmonary edema, massive aspiration, and developing infectious pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion is new.
