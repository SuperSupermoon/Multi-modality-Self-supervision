Transvenous atrial biventricular pacer defibrillator leads with left pectoral generator are unchanged. Right IJ central line with tip over the upper right atrium is unchanged. Right-sided chest tube is new. No pneumothorax is detected. The patient is status post sternotomy, with a large cardiomediastinal silhouette, similar to the prior film. Again seen is opacification at the right base which likely represents a combination of a right effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. The right pleural effusion may be very slightly smaller. Faint blurring in the upper zones bilaterally likely reflects CHF, also similar to the prior study. Equivocal area of more confluent density in the upper right lung laterally, though I suspect that this is artifact due to overlying iatrogenic device. There is atelectasis in the retro cardio region, similar prior. No gross left effusion.
