Low lung volumes are present. Heterogeneous opacities at the right lung base are most consistent with an infectious process. Minimal patchy and linear opacity is also noted in the left mid lung field. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are normal. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Given that the right heart border is seen through these opacities, the process is likely in the right lower lobe.
