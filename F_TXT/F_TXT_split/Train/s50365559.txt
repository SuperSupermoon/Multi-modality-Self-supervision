An AP frontal portable view of the chest is obtained. There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating in the mid SVC, without evidence of pneumothorax. No pleural effusion is seen. There is an ill-defined focal opacity at the left mid lung of unclear clinical significance. Suggest oblique views for further evaluation to assess it persists and if it appears pulmonary, then CT may be indicated. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
