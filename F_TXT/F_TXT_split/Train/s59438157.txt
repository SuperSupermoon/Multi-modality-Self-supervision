Since the prior exam, the enteric tube has been pulled back. The tip is still in the stomach, though the side port is above the gastroesophageal junction. A left PICC is in unchanged position with the tip in the upper-to-mid SVC. Pulmonary edema has resolved. There is no opacity to suggest pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette size is at the upper limits of normal, and unchanged.
