AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The patient is extubated as previously visible ETT cannot be identified anymore. A right subclavian approach central venous line is now seen reaching to the lower SVC area. An NG tube is seen as before reaching well below the diaphragm. Marked cardiomegaly as before and deviation of the endogastric tube in the esophagus to the left, indicative of left atrial enlargement. Comparison is made with the lung fields with the preceding examination, there is now much more marked perivascular haze surrounding the pulmonary vasculature indicative of pulmonary edema. Increased haze on the bases can also be explained by increasing pleural effusions layering posteriorly. No pneumothorax is seen. Advanced degenerative changes in both shoulder joints as described before.
