Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Since the prior study, there has been significant interval enlargement of now globular cardiac silhouette, raising concern for underlying pericardial effusion. There may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. No definite focal consolidation is seen. The left costophrenic angle is not well seen, which may be due to overlying soft tissue, although a small pleural effusion is not excluded. No pneumothorax.
