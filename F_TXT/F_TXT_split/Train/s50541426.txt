As compared to the previous radiograph, the very extensive consolidations in the left lung have further increased, causing near total opacification of the left hemi thorax, associated to substantial volume loss. The tip of the endotracheal tube is within 1 cm of the carinal and should be pulled back by approximately 2 cm. The position of the left PICC line is constant. On the right, the apical parenchymal opacity is unchanged in extent and distribution.
