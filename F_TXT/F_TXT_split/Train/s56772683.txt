As compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff catheter has been replaced. The new catheter shows a normal course, the tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach. The right PICC line has obviously been pulled back and the tip now projects over the right axillary vein. Replacing the line should be considered. Unchanged evidence of a minimal right pleural effusion with areas of atelectasis at the right lung bases. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis. No pneumothorax. No overt pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumonia. The alignment of the sternal wires is constant.
