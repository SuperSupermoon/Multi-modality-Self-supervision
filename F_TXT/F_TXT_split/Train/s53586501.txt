Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. A right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, distal tip not well seen, but likely terminating in the mid SVC. No focal consolidation or hemothorax is seen. The costophrenic angles are not sharp, particularly on the left, but this may relate to overlying soft tissue. No overt pulmonary edema. The aorta is slightly tortuous and calcified. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
