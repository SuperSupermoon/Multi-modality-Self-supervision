AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The heart is enlarged. There is a prominence of the left ventricular contour to the left and as a typical semicircular calcified shadow within the heart identifies the mitral ring there is considerable left atrial enlargement with double contour within the heart shadow on the right side. The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern and some increased interstitial markings on the bases but no conclusive evidence for any pleural effusion as the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. No evidence of new acute pulmonary infiltrates are present and no pneumothorax exists in the apical area. In comparison with the next preceding chest examination of ___, findings appear to be stable.
