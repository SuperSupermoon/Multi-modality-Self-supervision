Atelectasis is noted at the left lung base. In addition, indistinctness of the right heart border may be due to infection versus atelectasis. A better evaluation would be provided on a chest CT, which has already been ordered. A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid-to-low SVC. Endotracheal tube terminates 3.8 cm above the carina. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. No large pleural effusion. Cardiac size is normal limits.
