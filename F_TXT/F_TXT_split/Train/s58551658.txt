Right-sided chest tubes remain in place. No pneumothorax is appreciated. There are increasing patchy opacities at both bases which could reflect atelectasis, although aspiration and pneumonia should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient positioning. Biapical pleural thickening likely reflects postinflammatory changes.
