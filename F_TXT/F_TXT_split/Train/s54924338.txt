Study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation and the patient's chin projecting over and obscuring the lung apices. Lung volumes are low. The heart remains mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The aorta is tortuous. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There has been interval improvement in aeration of the right lung base, but persistent patchy opacities are seen within the left lung base. No large pleural effusion is seen, but a small left pleural effusion cannot be completely excluded. No pneumothorax. No acutely displaced fractures are seen. A remote right-sided rib fracture is noted.
