Lung volumes are extremely low which leads to bronchovascular crowding. There is bibasilar atelectasis and vascular congestion. There may be patchy opacity in the right mid lung, which could be related to vascular congestion but cannot exclude consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting. The heart is top-normal in size. There is no pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion.
