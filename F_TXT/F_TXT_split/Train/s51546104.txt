AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained a day earlier. The left PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance. Widespread parenchymal opacities appear to be unchanged or minimally worse in the lung bases, potentially reflecting different phase of respiratory cycle. Bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present.
