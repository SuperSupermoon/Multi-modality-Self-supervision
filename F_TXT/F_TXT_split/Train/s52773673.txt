A portable AP radiograph of the chest once again demonstrates extensive subcutaneous emphysema throughout the thorax. A left chest tube is unchanged in position and the previously seen pleural edge is no longer visualized, indicating resolution of the pneumothorax. Minimally displaced fractures of the posterior left second and fifth ribs are once again seen. There is no pleural effusion, and the hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Right middle lobe atelectasis persists, but the lungs are otherwise clear.
