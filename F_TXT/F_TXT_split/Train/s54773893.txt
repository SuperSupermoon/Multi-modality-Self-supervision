Following recent bronchoscopy, there has been slight improved aeration in the right mid and lower lung, which remains densely consolidated, however. Large partially loculated right pleural effusion is unchanged. Within the left lung, interstitial edema has slightly improved, but left retrocardiac opacity and adjacent pleural effusion are unchanged.
