A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the lower SVC. Surgical sutures are seen in the right upper lung. There are new, moderate interstitial and airspace opacities at the lung bases, right greater than left. Given the development of mild pulmonary edema in the upper lung fields and slight increase in heart size, this is largely credited to new, moderate pulmonary edema. The right hemidiaphragm shows a peculiar shape, probably from dysfunction secondary to the hepatic abnormalities. This finding could explain the more focal opacity in the right lung base as asymmetric pulmonary edema, however, aspiration is also a possibility. Continued attention to this area after diuresis is recommended. A small right pleural effusion is unchanged. These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 9:43 on ___ by telephone 5 minutes of discovery.
