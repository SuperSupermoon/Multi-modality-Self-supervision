Left lung base opacity is seen with a slight shift of the mediastinum to the left, may be due to underlying atelectasis, known pulmonary mass with possible pleural effusion, underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude. The lungs are otherwise hyperinflated suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Slight increase in markings at the right lung base is similar compared to the prior study. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unremarkable. No pneumothorax is seen.
