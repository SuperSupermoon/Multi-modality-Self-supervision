There has been interval retraction of the endotracheal tube, which is now 12 cm from the carina, above the thoracic inlet. This should be advanced by 5-6 cm for more appropriate positioning. The right PICC line and enteric tubes are unchanged. Lung volumes remain low and pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged, mild. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
