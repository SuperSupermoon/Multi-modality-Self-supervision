The left PICC tip sits at the confluence of brachiocephalic veins. The heart size is within normal limits. An angular curved density projecting over the heart is felt to be external to the patient. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The lung volumes are mildly low but clear of consolidation. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax; the right hemidiaphragm appears chronically elevated. An old right rib fracture is nondisplaced. A right upper quadrant abdominal drain is present.
