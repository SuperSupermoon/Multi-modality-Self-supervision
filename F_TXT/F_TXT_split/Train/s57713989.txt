AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained six hours earlier during the same day. The right-sided chest tube remains in unchanged position and terminates in the right apical area. No pneumothorax has developed. The previously identified bilateral basal atelectases remain rather unchanged. Comparison does not demonstrate new infiltrates. No mediastinal shift and no evidence of increase in pleural effusion.
