Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 12:54 p.m. There is evidence of right pleural effusion, overall unchanged since the prior study, potentially with loculated components. For precise assessment of the effusion, decubitus view might be beneficial. Left lung is essentially clear with minimal small amount of pleural fluid potentially present. Right upper lobe consolidation appears to be unchanged and might reflect prior radiation changes as well as potentially infectious process. Given the right hemithorax volume loss, the post-radiation changes with some chronic scarring from prior ulcer infection is the preferable choice. The pacemaker lead terminates in the right ventricle. Extensive calcifications projecting over the left chest wall might be consistent with loose bodies or soft tissue calcifications, dedicated shoulder examination might be considered if clinically necessary.
