In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the upper stomach. The side-port is just distal to the esophagogastric junction. If possible, the tube should be pushed forward about 5-8 cm 4 more optimal positioning. Continued low lung volumes without vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
