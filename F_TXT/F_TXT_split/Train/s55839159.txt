Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a moderate sized left pleural effusion and bibasilar opacities, which may represent atelectasis, however aspiration or pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Additional areas of opacity are seen in the right upper lobe, which again may represent atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia. The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged. No pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach. Endotracheal tube ends 4.5 cm from the carina.
