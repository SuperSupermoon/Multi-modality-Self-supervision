AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: With the chin elevated, tip of the endotracheal tube is less than 15 mm from the carina. It should be withdrawn at least 5 cm. Heart is mildly enlarged and pulmonary and mediastinal vessels are engorged suggesting volume overload, but there is no pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube passes into the upper stomach but the tip is not visible. No pneumothorax.
