Interval increase in size of large layering right pleural collection consistent with hemothorax given history of bloody pleural fluid coming from the chest tube. Right chest tube remains unchanged in position. There is now slight shift to the mediastinal and cardiac structures to the left. There is improved aeration at the left base with interval appearance of patchy opacity in the left mid lung which may reflect an area of atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. Heart remains enlarged.
