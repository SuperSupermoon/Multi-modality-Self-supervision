Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of Swan-Ganz catheter and ETT and remaining right-sided central venous sheath with tip terminating in the upper SVC. There is stable cardiomegaly with improving postoperative pneumopericardium. No chest tubes or mediastinal drains are evident. A fold is identified crossing left ribs ___, possibly a pleural fold due to small apical pneumothorax; however, unable to assess for lung markings beyond this fold due to overlying medical devices. There is redemonstration of prominent interstitial markings and hazy vascular consistent with pulmonary edema with increased lucency in the left upper lobe. However, unclear if this is related to possible pneumothorax or improved aeration. Trace pneumoperitoneum newevident and may be due to previous reported pneumopericardium. Please correlate with any abdominal surgical history, instrumentation and clinical exam. Slightly increased retrocardiac opacity may reflect a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion though in the appropriate clinical setting, infectious process cannot be excluded.
