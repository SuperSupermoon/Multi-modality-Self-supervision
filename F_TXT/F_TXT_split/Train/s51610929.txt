A large right pleural effusion is without substantial interval change from the previous radiograph. There is been interval placement of a right basilar chest tube with tip projecting over the medial right base. There is persistent right basilar opacification likely reflective of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present. Streaky left basilar opacity is re- demonstrated. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
