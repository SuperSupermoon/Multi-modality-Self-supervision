In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued opacification at the right base, consistent with pleural fluid and atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. The right base opacification is improving. There is still probably some small effusion with atelectatic change. Elevation of pulmonary venous pressure persists. The tracheal tube remains in place.
