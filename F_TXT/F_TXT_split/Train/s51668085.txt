As compared to the previous radiograph, the malpositioned Dobbhoff catheter has been removed and replaced by a nasogastric tube. The tube shows a normal course, the tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach, the side port is located approximately 2 to 3 cm distally to the gastroesophageal junction. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Otherwise, the appearance of the lung parenchyma and of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
