A Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. A right IJ central venous catheter now terminates within the right upper atrium. Mediastinal drains, thoracostomy tubes, mediastinal clips, and sternal wires are unchanged in position. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion, without overt edema, is unchaged. There is no pneumothorax.
