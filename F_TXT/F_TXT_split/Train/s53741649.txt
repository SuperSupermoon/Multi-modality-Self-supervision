Compared to the prior study, the allowing for differences in positioning, the overall appearance is similar. As before, there bibasilar opacities, probably with a small right pleural effusion. The degree of opacity at the right base could be slightly in increased. There is vascular plethora, consistent with CHF, similar to the prior study. Again seen is increased retrocardiac opacity at the left base, compatible with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, probably with a small effusion. Question elevation left hemidiaphragm with versus a dense band of atelectasis coursing superiorly to the left chest wall. Dual lead pacemaker again noted, with tips overlying right atrium and right ventricle. No pneumothorax detected.
