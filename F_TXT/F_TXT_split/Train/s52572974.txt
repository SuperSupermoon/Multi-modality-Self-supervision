Single AP frontal chest radiograph was provided. As seen on prior exam, there is a large left hilar mass with hazy opacity within the left lung compatible with left upper lobe collapse. A component of left lower lobe collapse is not excluded. There is increased opacity in the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure which is concerning for pneumonia. Underlying emphysema is noted. Calcified granulomas are seen in the right lower lung. Heart size cannot be assessed. The mediastinal structures are slightly deviated to the left which likely reflects the presence of significant left lung collapse. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
