CHEST, 1 VW There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema which obscures detail of the lungs. Allowing for this, there is a small left pneumothorax, similar, possibly very slightly smaller, compared with ___ at 21:56. There are hazy opacities in the right upper and lower zones and there is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with a small left effusion. There is also pleural thickening at the right lung apex, unchanged. Linear lucency projecting to the left of the spine could represent some mediastinal emphysema.
