Since ___, bilateral multifocal opacities appear worse and may represent increasing pulmonary edema. However, concurrent multifocal pneumonia is not excluded. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to large on the right and small on the left, and associated bibasilar atelectasis are increased. Lung volumes remain low. The tip of an endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina. An NG tube is seen in the stomach and continues out of view. No pneumothorax.
