1. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC unchanged. There is a layering left effusion. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities are now seen suggestive of atelectasis, although a superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There has been interval improvement in the mild perihilar edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
