Right apical air and fluid persists. There is increased opacification of the right lung field, which may represent pleural fluid and/or consolidation. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with rightward mediastinal shift is consistent with right-sided volume loss, as seen previously. Right perihilar mass and left lung nodules are better seen on recent prior CT. Small left pleural effusion persists. Aortic calcifications are noted. The right pleural catheter is similarly positioned. Stent in the right mainstem bronchus is faintly visible.
