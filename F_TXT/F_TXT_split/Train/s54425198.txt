Compared to the most recent prior chest x-ray, no significant change is detected. Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. Again seen is increased retrocardiac density, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. This area of retrocardiac opacity apparently includes the patient's known necrotic lung mass, which was better depicted on the ___ CT scan. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. There is platelike atelectasis at the right lung base medially. Tubing seen overlying the left hemidiaphragm likely corresponds to the the patient's pericardial drain.
