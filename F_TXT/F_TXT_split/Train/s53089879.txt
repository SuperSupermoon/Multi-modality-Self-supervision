NG tube is seen with tip projecting off the inferior field of view, side port is not clearly delineated but is certainly beyond the GE junction. Large amount of gas-filled bowel is seen in the upper abdomen. There is lucency below the right and left hemidiaphragm, potentially within a gas-filled stomach on the left and potentially loops of colon on the right, however, the configuration is slightly different when compared to CT scan and repeat exam is recommended to exclude possibility of free intraperitoneal air given change in appearance. Appearance of the lungs is unchanged and limited due to the severe scoliosis. No large confluent consolidation is identified. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft tissue structures notable for probable proximal left humeral fracture which appears old.
