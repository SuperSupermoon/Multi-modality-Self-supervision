Previous moderate pulmonary edema has substantially improved, with some residual in the right apex, and a larger region in the right lower lobe suggesting concurrent pneumonia. Hyperinflation, increased after resolution of edema, indicates emphysema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Right lower lobe pneumonia was described in the report of the chest CT performed 3 hr earlier.
