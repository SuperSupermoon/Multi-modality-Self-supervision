Endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position. The enteric tube courses along the esophagus and terminates either field-of-view, likely within the stomach. Diffuse, bilateral interstitial opacities are worse than yesterday. There is likely a small left pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged and normal. There is no pneumothorax.
