Patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and mitral valve replacement. Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Patient is also status post right lower lobe wedge resection as well as right mastectomy with soft tissue density projecting over the right chest wall re- demonstrated. Lungs remain hyperinflated with attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the upper lobes compatible with emphysema. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta again noted. Linear opacities in both lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis or scarring. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Right basolateral pleural thickening is again demonstrated along with multiple prior right-sided rib deformities.
