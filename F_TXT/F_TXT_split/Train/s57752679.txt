There are bilateral pleural effusions, right significantly greater than left. There appears to be a slight improvement in the layering portion of this effusion that this may be partially due to positioning of the patient. Mild pulmonary edema, improved from prior. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Enteric tube is seen in the stomach, but the tip extends beyond the inferior margin of the image. Right PICC line is unchanged in position and terminates at the distal SVC. Median sternotomy wires are unchanged in appearance. No acute osseous abnormalities.
