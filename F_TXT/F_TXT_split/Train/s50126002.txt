Left chest tube remains in place. Previously reported basilar pneumothorax is less well visualized, possibly due to positional differences between the exams. Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Improved aeration at the left lung base with near resolution of linear left basilar atelectasis. Slight worsening of atelectasis at the right lung base.
