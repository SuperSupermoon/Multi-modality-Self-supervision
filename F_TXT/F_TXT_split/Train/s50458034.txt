The endotracheal tube ends 5.4 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular introducer and left internal jugular catheter end in the upper SVC. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the pulmonary outflow tract. Two surgical drains project over the right upper quadrant. A Dobhoff tube ends in the stomach, the superior part of which is coiled, projecting over the hypopharynx. Compared to ___, right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis are similar, with mediastinal shift to the right, suggesting atelectasis exceeds the effusion. No left effusion and no large pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
