In comparison with the study of ___, the tracheostomy tube remains in place. The tip of the right subclavian catheter is very difficult to identify, though it appears to be in the mid portion of the SVC. Continued low lung volumes. The left hemidiaphragm again is poorly seen, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
