A single portable frontal upright view of the chest was obtained. In comparison to the prior study, there is increased aeration of the left lung; however dense consolidation persists. Lung volumes remain low. Opacities in the right cardiophrenic angle are largely unchanged and may reflect atelectasis or consolidation. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
