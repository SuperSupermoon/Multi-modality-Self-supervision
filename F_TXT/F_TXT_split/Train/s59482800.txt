AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The ET tube has been replaced by tracheostomy that appears to be central in position as well as the tip being 5.5 cm above the carina. Two chest tubes, right and left are in unchanged position. Bibasal atelectasis is noted, there is slight interval improvement of lung aeration. Subcutaneous air collection is noted bilaterally, left more than right, but no definitive pneumothorax is seen.
