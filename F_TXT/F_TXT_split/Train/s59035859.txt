There is prominent lordotic positioning. There is cardiomegaly. Allowing for technical differences, no definite interval increase in the cardiac silhouette. The mediastinum is also enlarged, but probably unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, with patchy opacities in the left mid and lower zones and right base. The overall appearance is similar to the prior study -- slight apparent worsening in the right upper zone and the left base could reflect technical differences. The differential for multifocal opacities includes multifocal pneumonia. The possibility of a component of CHF cannot be excluded.
