There may be mild hyperinflation. Again seen is multi chamber cardiomegaly. The aortic knob is calcified and calcifications in the upper extremity are noted. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Again seen is linear atelectasis at the left lung base. No focal infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia is identified. No pleural effusions are seen. Slight asymmetry in the degree of hyperlucency of the lungs, greater on the left, may be related to slight rotation. Mild retraction of the minor fissure is noted, but no obvious right upper lobe atelectasis is identified. Of note, there is a rounded density measuring 16 mm in the right infrahilar region. I suspect that this represents a nipple shadow. Equivocal rounded density measuring approximately ___.5 mm overlying the right seventh anterior rib was not seen on the ___ radiograph may be an artifact due to overlap of rib shadows. Rounded lucency in the left humeral head, suggestive of osteonecrosis.
