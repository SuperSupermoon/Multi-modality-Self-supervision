Compared with the prior radiograph there is significant interval improvement of previously of lobular enlarged appearance of the heart. However there is new opacification of the right lower lung, likely combination of consolidation, atelectasis, and pleural effusion. There are also patchy opacities in the left upper lobe on the background of diffuse increased interstitial thickening and vascular congestion. The aorta is calcified as before. Cardiac size cannot be properly assessed in this AP exam. Severe mitral annular calcifications are present, unchanged.
