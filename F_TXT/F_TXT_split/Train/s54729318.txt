Right Port-A-Cath unchanged in position. Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. Overall, there has been substantial improvement in aeration throughout both lungs likely representing a combination of resolving infection and pulmonary edema. There may be a small residual layering right effusion. There is persistent airspace consolidation in the right mid lung and right medial lung base which may reflect residual pneumonia/aspiration. An underlying mass cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is recommended. No pneumothorax.
