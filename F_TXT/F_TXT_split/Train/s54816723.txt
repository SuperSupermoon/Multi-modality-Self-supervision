As compared to prior study of 1 day earlier, lung volumes are slightly increased. Asymmetrical lead distributed perihilar airspace opacities predominantly involving the right lung have slightly improved and may reflect asymmetrical edema with or without coexisting pneumonia. Widespread pulmonary nodules and masses persist, along with intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, consistent with metastatic disease. Bilateral small pleural effusions are present.
