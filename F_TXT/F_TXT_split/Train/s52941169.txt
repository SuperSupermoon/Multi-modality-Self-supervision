ET tube tip is 4.7 cm above the carinal. NG tube tip is 2 proximal, at the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced. Right internal jugular line tip is in the right atrium. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is substantially increased potentially due to very low lung volumes with bibasal consolidations. Nodular opacity in the right lower lobe is not well seen on the previous examination, might represent summation of shadows and should be reassessed on subsequent imaging. The findings might in fact represent a combination of low lung volumes and mild pulmonary edema.
