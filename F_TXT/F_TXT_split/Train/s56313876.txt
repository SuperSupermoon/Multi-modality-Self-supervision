A tracheostomy tube is noted in place. There is a right internal jugular central venous catheter with the catheter tip at the lower SVC. Lung volumes are low. There are increased interstitial markings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. Severe cardiomegaly is again noted. Bibasilar opacities likely are likely representative of bilateral small pleural effusions with atelectasis.
