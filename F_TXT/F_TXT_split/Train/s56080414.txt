AP chest compared to ___ at 12:35 p.m.: Large left hilar mass has grown since yesterday, probably due to limited bleeding, but there has been no change in the extent of left pleural abnormality consisting of fluid and/or tumor in the left major fissure and along the costal and diaphragmatic surfaces of the left lung. Athough there is no indication of bleeding since ___ at 12:35 p.m., pleural or pulmonary bleeding on the earlier examination could have developed after bronchoscopy. Right lung is clear. Leftward mediastinal shift indicates appreciable atelectasis due to the obstructing left hilar mass.
