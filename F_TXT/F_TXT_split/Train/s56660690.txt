Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Component of pulmonary edema has improved. Widened mediastinum has improved. Allowing the difference in positioning of the patient, large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent opacities are grossly unchanged. Cardiomegaly is stable. Right PICC tip is at the cavoatrial junction. NG tube tip is in the stomach.
