There is now almost complete opacification of the right hemithorax, with associated shift of the cardiomediastinal contours towards the right. Considering associated cutoff of the right main bronchus, this is likely due to right lung collapse secondary to central mucous plugging as discussed by phone with Dr. ___ at 11:10 a.m. on ___ at time of discovery.

Interval placement of nasogastric tube, with the tip terminating in the stomach. Dr. ___ has been notified of the right lung findings on ___ at 11:10 a.m. at the time of discovery.
