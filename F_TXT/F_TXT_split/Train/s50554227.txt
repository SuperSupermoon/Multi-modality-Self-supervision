Single frontal view of the chest. Heart size and mediastinal contours are normal. Medial right lung base and retrocardiac opacities are new and consistent with multifocal pneumonia. A spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe is similar to prior. Other known nodules were better evaluated on prior CT. Indistinct appearance of the left hemidiaphragm suggests the presence of a small pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
