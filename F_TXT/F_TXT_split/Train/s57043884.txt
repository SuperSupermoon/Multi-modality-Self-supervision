The patient is status post mitral valve replacement. A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged, with leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. The heart is again enlarged. The main pulmonary artery contour is likewise enlarged, as seen previously. There is dense new opacification of the left mid to lower lung, probably including the left lower lobe and lingula, with a pleural effusion of substantial size, moderate and possibly large. In addition, there is a moderate predominantly central interstitial abnormality with hazy perihilar opacification, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax or clear evidence for pleural effusion on the right.
