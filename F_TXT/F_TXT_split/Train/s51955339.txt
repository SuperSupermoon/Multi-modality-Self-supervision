An NG tube is present, tip extends beneath the diaphragm and overlies the stomach. Low inspiratory volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is new dense increased retrocardiac density, with new obscuration left hemidiaphragm, consistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. A small left effusion is likely present. In addition, rim like opacity at the left lung apex is compatible with pleural fluid. On the right, there is new low opacity remaining the right chest wall, with more focal convexity in relation to the lung surface along the right lower chest wall. The right costophrenic angle is obscured. There is atelectasis at the right lung base. Upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. Incidental note made of mild dilatation of a loop of small bowel in the mid abdomen (4.1 cm diameter).
