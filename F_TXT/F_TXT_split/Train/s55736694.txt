AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm accompanied by persistent severe gaseous distention of stomach and colon, developed between ___ and ___. There is no lobar collapse, so the findings suggest severe progression of diaphragmatic eventration or development of a paralyzed or otherwise non-functioning left hemidiaphragm over the past year. I see no pneumonia or large source of bleeding in the lung. Pulmonary embolism is neither suggested nor excluded by this radiographic appearance. Heart size is top normal, but there is no pulmonary edema or other evidence of cardiac decompensation. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
