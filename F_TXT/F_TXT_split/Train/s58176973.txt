As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an endotracheal tube. The tip of the tube projects 6.5 cm above the carina. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities, predominating on the right, have slightly increased in extent, and now leads to blunting of the right costophrenic sinus. This underlines the suspicion of pneumonia, as expressed in the previous report. No other changes. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
