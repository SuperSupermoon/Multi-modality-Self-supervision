No nasogastric tube is identified on this chest radiograph, but a subsequent chest radiograph performed later the same date documents a tube in place. Interval worsening of left lower lobe collapse, with adjacent persistent small to moderate left pleural effusion as well as slight increase in nonspecific left perihilar opacification. Small, partially layering right pleural effusion is apparently new. No other relevant changes.
