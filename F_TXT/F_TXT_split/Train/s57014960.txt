A single portable AP supine view of the chest was obtained. There is interval placement of a second chest tube in the right lung, directed towards the right apex. The left chest tube is stable in position. Small biapical pneumothoraces are unchanged in comparison to the most recent study. Scattered areas of plate-like atelectasis in both lungs and intra-abdominal free air, with extension into the mediastinum and the soft tissues of the body wall and neck are largely unchanged.
