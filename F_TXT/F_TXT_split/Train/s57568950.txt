Compared to chest radiographs on ___. ET tube, nasogastric tube are in standard placements. Indwelling right subclavian central venous infusion catheter ends in the right atrium. Small right pneumothorax is a little larger, and subcutaneous emphysema in the adjacent right chest wall unchanged, with no repositioning of the right lateral basal pigtail drainage catheter. There is no appreciable right pleural effusion. Lung volumes remain quite low and moderate atelectasis persists at both lung bases. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has nearly resolved. Previous mediastinal widening has improved, probably a function of better lung volumes.
