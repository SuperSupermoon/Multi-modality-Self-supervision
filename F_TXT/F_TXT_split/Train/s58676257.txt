Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate increase in left basilar opacity, consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis. Previously seen left upper lobe atelectasis has improved. There is fluid seen in the minor fissure along with associated atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax seen. Cardiac silhouette is unchanged but is partially obscured by the left pleural effusion. Widened mediastinum is unchanged from previous imaging. Pacer is seen in the left anterior axillary position with intact leads following the expected course to the right atrium and right ventricle. There has been interval removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter and a right IJ sheath is in place. The patient has been extubated since prior imaging. Again seen are a left-sided chest tube and a mediastinal drain. There has been interval increase in bowel gas.
