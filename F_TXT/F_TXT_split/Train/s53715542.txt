AP chest compared to ___: Low lung volumes exaggerate the widespread pulmonary abnormality. The bibasilar and right upper lobe predominance suggests this is largely due to multifocal pneumonia, but there does appear to be a component of interstitial pulmonary edema even though heart size is normal. Small pleural effusions are presumed. No pneumothorax.
