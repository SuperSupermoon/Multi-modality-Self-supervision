There is stable moderate cardiomegaly. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. Bilateral hila are not well seen. Diffuse bilateral nodular appearing airspace opacities likely represent pulmonary edema, however this appearance is nonspecific and differential includes alveolar hemorrhage in addition to disseminated Wegener's or multifocal infection, possibly septic emboli. Difficult to exclude trace pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
