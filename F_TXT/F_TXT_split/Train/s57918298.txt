Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Tracheostomy appears in appropriate position. Left PICC terminates in the mid SVC. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Irregular opacities overlying both lung bases, right greater than left, are compatible with infection. The left costophrenic angle is excluded but no substantial pleural effusion is visualized. No pneumothorax.
