The lungs are well expanded. There is bilateral hilar indistinctness consistent with central vascular engorgement but no overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the right cardiophrenic angle as well as in a paramediastinal location in the left mid lung are seen. Loss of definition of the vessels in the retrocardiac region is also apparent. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior.
