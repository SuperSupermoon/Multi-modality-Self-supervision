As compared to the previous radiograph, there is substantial improvement. The patient has received an endotracheal tube. The tip of the tube projects approximately 6 cm above the carina. The patient also has a left internal jugular vein catheter and a right central venous catheter. There are bilateral pleural effusions and signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, but the pre-existing severe pulmonary edema has decreased in severity. The size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be large.
