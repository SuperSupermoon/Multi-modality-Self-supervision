Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is a nasogastric tube whose distal tip and sideport are below the GE junction. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 5.4 cm above the carina. There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity and bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. Bibasilar atelectasis is also present. There is no overt pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces. Overall, these findings appear stable.
