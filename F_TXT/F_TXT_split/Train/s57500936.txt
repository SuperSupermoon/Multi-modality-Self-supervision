Similar appearance of left apical hydropneumothorax, as well as adjacent parenchymal opacities related to post-RFA site and post-operative site in this patient status post partial left lung resection. Marked worsening opacification in lower right hemithorax involving right middle and right lower lobes may reflect a combination of atelectasis and effusion, but co-existing infectious consolidation is possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has increased in size as well in the interval.
