Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm and is coiled within the stomach. Endotracheal tube and right subclavian central line are unchanged in position. There is interval increase in bilateral airspace disease consistent with worsening pulmonary edema. Layering bilateral effusions are also again seen with associated bibasilar airspace opacity most likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stable given differences in patient positioning. No pneumothorax.
