In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification at the right base extending to the perihilar region. This could represent increasing volume loss in the right lower lobe, though in the appropriate clinical setting it could easily be a manifestation of developing pneumonia. Continued opacification in the retrocardiac region with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle. This is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe with pleural fluid. However, in the appropriate clinical setting it also could be a manifestation of developing consolidation.
