The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent prior study. The pulmonary vasculature is indistinct with new patchy opacification, predominantly in the bilateral lung bases, which likely reflect a combination of subsegmental atelectasis and mild to moderate pulmonary edema. There is increased retrocardiac opacification. Small pleural effusions cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Note is again made of calcification at the aortic knob. An ovoid metallic object again projects at the right lung base along the right cardiac border, unchanged from the prior study. A metallic coil is noted in the periphery of the right lung base, which is also stable.
