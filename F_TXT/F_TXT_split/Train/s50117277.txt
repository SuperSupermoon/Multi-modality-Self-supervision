Re-identified are bilateral glenohumeral prosthetic devices. There is significant rightward rotation of the patient on the current radiograph. Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable, reflective of moderate cardiomegaly. There is pulmonary vascular congestion and possibly early or mild pulmonary edema. There is bibasilar atelectasis. There is no definite focal lung consolidation, however the right lung is at least partly obscured medially and at its inferior aspect due to patient rotation, making evaluation of the right lung difficult. There is no pneumothorax. There is no sizable pleural effusion, although difficult to exclude trace left pleural effusion.
