Portable semiupright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis which is unchanged from the prior study. Again seen is some engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature, consistent with pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. A right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction.
