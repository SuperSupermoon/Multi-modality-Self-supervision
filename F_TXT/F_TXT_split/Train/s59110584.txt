A right-sided PICC terminates in the right axillary vein. A tunnel dialysis catheter is seen. In the left internal jugular, terminating in the right atrium. Lung volumes remain low. There is persistent airspace opacity in the right lower lung, likely related to atelectasis as there is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion. Prominence of the pulmonary vascular is consistent with congestive heart failure. There is moderate cardiomegaly. A pigtail drain is seen in the left upper quadrant. No pneumothorax seen. A tracheostomy is unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study.
