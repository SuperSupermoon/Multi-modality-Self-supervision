Patient is rotated to the left. Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Prominence and indistinctness of the hila suggests pulmonary vascular engorgement. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may in part relate to overlying soft tissue, although small pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis may be present. Patchy left basilar opacity may represent combination of vascular congestion and basilar atelectasis with possible small pleural effusion, although underlying consolidation is not excluded. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.
