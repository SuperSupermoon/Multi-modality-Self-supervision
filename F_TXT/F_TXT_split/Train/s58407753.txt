As compared to the previous radiograph, there is almost unchanged hyperlucency in the region of the left lung apex. However, no pleural line can be securely identified. The pre-existing opacities on the right appear slightly progressive, predominantly given an increase in diameter of the pulmonary vasculature. On the left, the pre-existing parenchymal changes are constant, with exception of a small decrease in extent of a pre-existing pleural effusion. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged right PICC line and feeding tube.
