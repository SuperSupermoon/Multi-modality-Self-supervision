The patient is intubated. The endotracheal ends 4.3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube follows its expected course although the tip is not visualized. A right Port-A-Cath and left internal jugular catheter end in the mid SVC. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged on the left and slightly increased on the right with adjacent atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded. Mild cardiomegaly persists. Soft tissue density adjacent to the lateral aspect of the aortic knob is newly appeared, unlikely to be caused by known prevascular lymph nodes. This in conjunction with the left pleural effusion are concerning for dissection.
