Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates an enlarged cardiac silhouette, likely exaggerated due to technique. Again seen are vague bilateral patchy opacities, in the appropriate clinical context, that could represent multifocal pneumonia. There is mild indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature without definite interlobular septal thickening or pleural effusions.
