AP chest compared to ___: Upper enteric tube ends in the region of the pylorus, in a completely decompressed stomach. The transverse colon in both flexures are filled with stool. There is no pneumoperitoneum. Lungs are clear, cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces unremarkable. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is new, probably explained by a subphrenic process. A section of tubing, roughly 4 cm long, projects over the right heart on chest radiographs since ___, presumably a long coronary stent. Unfortunately, the lateral view on ___, does not show it, so I cannot localize it, but unless its identity is known to the clinical service, it needs to be investigated with imaging to exclude a retained catheter fragment in the right atrium. Fluoroscopy would be the easiest. A right PIC line ends at the origin of the SVC and a transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their courses, unchanged. I discussed the findings at length by telephone with Dr. ___ at 9AM.
