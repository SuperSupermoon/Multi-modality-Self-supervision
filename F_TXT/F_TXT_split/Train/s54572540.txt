Lung volumes are within normal limits and unchanged compared to the prior study. There are persistent bibasilar opacities with ring shadows consistent with bronchiectasis. Appearances are consistent with the patient's known pulmonary fibrosis. Difficult to exclude superimposed infection however the the appearances are grossly similar when compared to the prior study. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen. The visualized bony structures are unremarkable in appearance.
