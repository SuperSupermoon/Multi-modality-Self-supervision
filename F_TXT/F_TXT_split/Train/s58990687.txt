1. A persistent consolidation in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe is seen and is concerning for pneumonia. There are bilateral effusions, left much greater than the right and therefore it is possible that some of the left lower lobe consolidation could reflect compressive atelectasis rather than an acute infectious process. There continues to be indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature which has slightly worsened suggesting an element of superimposed pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to the diffuse airspace process.
