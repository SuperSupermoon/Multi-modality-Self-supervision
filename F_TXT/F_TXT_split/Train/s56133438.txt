New left-sided chest tube is seen entering the left lateral thoracic wall and ending in the left upper lung region. Compared with prior exam there has been nearly complete evacuation of the left-sided pneumothorax. Small amount of subcutaneous gas is secondary to a chest tube placement. The lungs are well inflated without focal opacities. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion. No right-sided pneumothorax is present.
