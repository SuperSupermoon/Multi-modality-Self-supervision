AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained earlier. The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Heart size is normal. Mediastinum is slightly widened, unchanged. As compared to the prior study, there is slight interval improvement in widespread parenchymal opacities which are still present, substantially involving lungs bilaterally. Sclerosis within the left humerus is most likely related to prior surgical treatment. They might potentially reflect improving pulmonary edema, but attention to those areas to exclude the possibility of infectious process is recommended. As previously mentioned, the lower thoracic vertebral fractures can be seen on current examination.
