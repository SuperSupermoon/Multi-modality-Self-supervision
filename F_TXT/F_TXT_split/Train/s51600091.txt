As compared to the prior examination, there has been no significant interval change. The patient is status post VATS right hilar nodal biopsy, and there is no overt pneumothorax identified. A right chest tube is in unchanged location. Small, bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Allowing for differences in the patient positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
