Lung volumes are low and pulmonary vasculature is engorged. More focal abnormalities in the right lung could be contusion or atelectasis. There is no lobar collapse or appreciable pleural effusion and no evidence of pneumothorax. Heart is top-normal size. ET tube ends above the clavicles, no less than 6.5 cm from the carina and should be advanced 2.5 cm for more secure positioning. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
