A pacemaker/ICD device has two ventricular leads and a single right atrial lead. The device projects over the right upper hemithorax. The heart is moderate-to-severely enlarged. The main pulmonary artery contour is prominent. The aortic arch is calcified. The diaphragmatic contour on the left is indistinct but the significance is difficult to judge given cardiomegaly. The lungs are difficult to assess in this area and it is also difficult to exclude a small left-sided pleural effusion. However, there is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right. Otherwise, aside from streaky lingular atelectasis, the visualized lungs appear clear. Mild rightward convex is curvature centered along the mid thoracic spine. Surgical clips project along the left axilla.
