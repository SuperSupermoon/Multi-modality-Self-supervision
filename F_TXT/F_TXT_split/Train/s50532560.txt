As compared to the previous radiograph, there is slightly increased bilateral lung volume, likely reflecting either improved ventilation or increased respiratory pressure. The signs suggesting pulmonary edema are improved, but mild edema is still present. No pneumothorax. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions.
