In comparison with study of ___, there is diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications in a pattern consistent with the clinical diagnosis of congestive failure. Cardiac silhouette is more prominent, though some of this may be due to the portable supine position. The left hemidiaphragm is poorly seen, suggesting some layering pleural effusion on this side. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude supervening pneumonia. The endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 5.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach.
