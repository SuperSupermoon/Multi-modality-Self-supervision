In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is an placement of a nasogastric tube that extends at least to the upper stomach. The side-port is not definitely seen and it cannot be definitively determined that it is below the EG junction. A repeat study using abdominal technique and centered at the hilum of the lung would be recommended. There is an placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. Continued low lung volumes.
