The right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. The endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carinal. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The large layering bilateral pleural effusions are again seen. Associated bibasilar opacities most likely represent partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is not possible given the marked rotation of the patient on the current study. No pneumothorax.
