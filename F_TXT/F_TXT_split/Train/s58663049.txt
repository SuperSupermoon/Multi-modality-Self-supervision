Cardiac size cannot be evaluated due to the rotation of the patient. ET tube is in standard position. Dobbhoff tube tip is in the stomach. Right apical and left medial chest tubes are in unchanged position. Very small bilateral apical pneumothoraces are unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Mild pulmonary edema is stable. Biapical and bilateral basal opacities that are unchanged and a combination of atelectasis and fluid in the fissure.
