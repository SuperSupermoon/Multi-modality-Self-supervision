The lung volumes are low. The heart size is difficult to assess. Multifocal opacities in the lower lungs appear more confluent than on the prior study, particularly at the right lung base. The significance is uncertain since there has been opacification in the area suggesting chronic scarring. However, along the lateral right lung base, a new lateral component was not clearly present on recent prior radiographs and may represent superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
