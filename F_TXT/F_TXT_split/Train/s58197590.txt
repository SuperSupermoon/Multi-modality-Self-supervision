The cardiac silhouette is largely unremarkable for technique. No significant abnormalities are seen of the pulmonary vasculature. There is no definite peribronchial cuffing. Mild right-sided basilar opacity. An opacity is seen at the left lung base, with indistinctness of the left costophrenic angle. This may represent basilar atelectasis, though difficult to exclude a developing pneumonia. Soft tissue calcifications are noted in the right supraclavicular region. There is mild dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine.
