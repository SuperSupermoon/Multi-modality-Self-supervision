AP view of the torso centered at the diaphragm shows a nasogastric tube ending in the upper stomach. Top normal heart size is attributable to supine positioning and low volume inspiration, which suggested new opacification at the left lung base, probably atelectasis. Tip of the endotracheal tube is seen at the upper margin of this study, which excludes the lung apices, in standard position.
