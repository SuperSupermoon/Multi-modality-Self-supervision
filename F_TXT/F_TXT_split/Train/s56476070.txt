Interval removal of the right internal jugular central line. Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm. Endotracheal tube and esophageal probe are stable in position. Stable small bilateral effusions. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Given differences in technique, no significant interval change in the right lower lobe airspace opacity and the other scattered patchy opacities in the left mid and lower lung. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
