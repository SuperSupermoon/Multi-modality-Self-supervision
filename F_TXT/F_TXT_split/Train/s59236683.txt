Compared to the prior film and allowing for considerable differences in technique, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen are extensive bilateral, diffuse, but somewhat patchy, opacities, similar in appearance. Presence or absence of associated CHF would be difficult to evaluate. No gross interval change is detected. Also again seen is cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires, unchanged. The left subclavian PICC line with tip over distal SVC is similar to the prior film.
