A Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava. There is again a gastrostomy tube projecting over the left upper quadrant and cholecystectomy clips projecting over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. There is a device projecting over the upper mediastinum that presumably lies outside of the patient. The heart is normal in size. An increasing consolidation with marked volume loss of the right upper lobe persists with decreased aeration and greater opacification. Volume loss is again associated with moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. In addition, there are vague patchy opacities which are new and widespread within each lung, especially in the left infrahilar region. At least two of these appear nodular, although one of them is suggestive of a nipple shadow. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
