1. Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which has its tip 5 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. A right internal jugular central line has its tip in the right atrium, unchanged. There is interval decrease in lung volumes with bibasilar airspace opacities and likely pleural effusions. These findings favor partial lower lobe atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia or aspiration can not be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. There is widening of the mediastinal contours, which may related to vascular crowding given the markedly low volumes. Followup imaging once the patient is clinically stable would be advised. Cardiac size is stable and within the upper limits of normal given portable technique.
