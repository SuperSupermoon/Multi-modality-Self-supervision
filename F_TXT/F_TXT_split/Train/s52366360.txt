ET tube is seen terminating 4.7 cm above the carina. There is again seen an NG tube with distal tip projecting below lower limit of film. A right-sided IJ central line is seen in essentially stable position projecting over the mid SVC. There is a stable left-sided chest tube, however despite this the left pneumothorax has redeveloped a large apical component, which now measures 5.9 cm from the apex of lung to apical chest wall. Despite differences in technique/patient positioning in comparison to prior radiographs, this is almost certainly significantly increased in size. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are normal. The bilateral hila are normal. There is increased opacification of most of the left lung due to relaxation atelectasis in the setting of left pneumothorax. There may be a small left pleural effusion. The right lung appears well aerated without evidence of focal consolidation. There is no right pleural effusion or right pneumothorax. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
