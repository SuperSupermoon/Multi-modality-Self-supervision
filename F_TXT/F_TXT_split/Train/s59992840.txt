One portable supine view of the chest. Endotracheal tube ends 2 cm from the carina. Heart size is top normal. The aorta is tortuous. There are patchy opacities in the mid and upper lung zones bilaterally. This may represent aspiration given that the patient was found lying down. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. No fractures identified however evaluation is limited given technique.
