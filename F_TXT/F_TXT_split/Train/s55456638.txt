In comparison with the study of ___, there has been removal of a substantial amount of fluid from the right pleural space. No evidence of pneumothorax. Opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. There is some prominence of central vessels on the left consistent with some asymmetric pulmonary edema. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
