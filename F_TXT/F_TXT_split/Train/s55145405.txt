Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right-sided infusion port, with the tip terminating in the upper right atrium. Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. Cardio mediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. Suspect mild cardiomegaly, with a calcified tortuous aorta. There is bilateral hilar prominence. Possible mild peribronchial cuffing is noted and the minor fissure is slightly thickened. There is mild prominence of interstitial markings at both bases. There is patchy opacity at both lung bases medially. There is no definite pleural effusion. No pneumothorax or obvious subdiaphragmatic air detected. Right upper quadrant surgical clips noted. Previously described (CT) described small pulmonary nodules that are not well depicted radiographically.
