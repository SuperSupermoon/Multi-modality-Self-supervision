Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 5:05 p.m. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged including cardiomegaly. Mediastinum is within normal limits. Lungs are hyperinflated. Bibasal linear opacities might potentially represent areas of atelectasis. Vascular stent projecting over the right upper chest most likely within the venous structure is re-demonstrated. Overall, no evidence of acute process currently seen.
