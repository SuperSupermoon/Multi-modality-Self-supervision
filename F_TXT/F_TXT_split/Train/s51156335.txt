AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Rapid onset of diffuse pulmonary opacification on ___ and subsequent substantial clearance, do not support a diagnosis of ARDS. Instead, I would favor transient pulmonary edema accompanied by slight increase in heart size with therefore a component of cardiac overload or decompensation. The heterogeneous peribronchial opacification persists at both lung bases suggests pneumonia either predisposing to subsequent events, or due to aspiration during treatment. The patient is currently extubated and lung volumes are well maintained. Small pleural effusions are probably residual of the nearly resolved edema. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
