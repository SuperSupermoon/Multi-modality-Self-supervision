Since the recent radiograph, aspirated barium within the tracheobronchial tree has mostly cleared. There remains barium within the neoesophagus. Moderate right pleural effusion has increased in size and is accompanied by increasing right mid and lower lung opacities, which may be due to atelectasis with or without co-existing aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Patchy and linear atelectasis in the left lung base has slightly improved. Otherwise, no relevant change.
