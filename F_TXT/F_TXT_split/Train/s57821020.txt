Patchy opacity at the left base is slightly improved. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. No pneumothorax is detected. Known rib fractures are not not well depicted radiographically, may correspond to slight irregularity of the right posterior ninth rib Left glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis again noted, incompletely evaluated.
