A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. It is difficult to evaluate opacities seen on prior chest CT since these were radiographically occult. There are streaky left basilar opacities on this examination, not specific but suggesting minor atelectasis with a suspected very small new left-sided pleural effusion. The right lung remains clear by radiography. There is no pneumothorax or right-sided pleural effusion.
