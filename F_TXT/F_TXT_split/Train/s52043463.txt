Portable supine AP view of the chest: The endotracheal tube is no less than 7 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at the approximate location of the cavoatrial junction. There is an orogastric tube coursing through the esophagus, and below the inferior edge of the radiograph toward the location of the stomach. There is diffuse reticular opacification of the bilateral lung fields. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is minimal cardiomegaly. Widening of the superior mediastinum is consistent with venous engorgement. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. There are surgical clips in the right upper quadrant, likely from cholecystectomy. The aorta is tortuous and contains atherosclerotic calcification.
