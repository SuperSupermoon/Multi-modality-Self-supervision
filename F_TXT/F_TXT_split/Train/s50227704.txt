During the latest examination interval, a new right-sided internal jugular approach central venous line has been placed, seen to terminate overlying the right-sided superior mediastinal structures at the level 2 cm above the carina. This is compatible with the upper third of the SVC. On the right base, the previously existing pigtail end catheter has been removed. A chest tube has now been inserted through the right-sided lateral chest wall at the level of the sixth rib interval. The chest tube makes a sharp kink in caudal direction to terminate in the posterior pleural sinus. There is significant increase of local chest wall edema at the site of the chest tube entrance. No new increased pleural effusion can be identified. Small right-sided pneumothorax appears to be unchanged, but is rather difficult to assess because of the overlying tissue edema. ___ was paged at 3:45 p.m.
