Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is a moderate left-sided pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded. There is prominence and indistinctness of the hila, suggesting pulmonary vascular engorgement/mild edema. Medial right upper lobe opacity may relate to pulmonary vascular congestion although a site of consolidation is not excluded. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to accurately assess due to the left base opacity. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable and aortic knob calcification is seen. The patient is rotated to the left.
