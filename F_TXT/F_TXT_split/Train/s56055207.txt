Severe dextroscoliosis and low lung volumes somewhat limits assessment. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Extensive degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine. Deformity of the sixth posterior right rib is unchanged, and could reflect the sequela of prior fracture.
