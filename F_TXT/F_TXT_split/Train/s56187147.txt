Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed. Compared to the prior study, there is a right-sided subclavian PICC line with tip ending in the cavoatrial junction. There has been interval resolution of both mild pulmonary edema and possible tiny pleural effusions. The lungs are clear and there is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
