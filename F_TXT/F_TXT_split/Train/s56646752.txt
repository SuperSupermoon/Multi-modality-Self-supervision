Comparison is made with prior study performed 10 hours earlier. ET tube tip is in a standard position 6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in the distal esophagus, should be advanced at least 10 cm for more standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with tortuous aorta, enlarged pulmonary arteries, and cardiomegaly. Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC. Bilateral pleural effusions are small. Bibasilar atelectasis has improved on the right and worsened on the left. There is mild vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax. Hardware in the thoracic spine is again noted.
