Interval placement of an endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4 cm above level of the carina. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, terminating in the proximal stomach, and could be advanced that it is well within the stomach. There are low lung volumes. The mediastinum appears widened, also noted on the prior study although more conspicuous on the current study. Unclear whether this relates to differences in inspiration and technique, correlate with concern for mediastinal process. Clinical concern for acute mediastinal process, chest CTA should be considered. Opacity at the left costophrenic angle may relate to overlying soft tissue although an underlying atelectasis or effusion not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen.
