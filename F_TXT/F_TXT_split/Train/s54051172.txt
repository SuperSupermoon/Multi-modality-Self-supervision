AP view of the chest provided. Again seen are multi-focal interstitial opacities with more confluent consolidations involving the left perihilar, right upper lobe, and right lower lobe, all largely unchanged since prior study. There are no large pleural effusions. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and left-sided central catheter are in appropriate positions.
