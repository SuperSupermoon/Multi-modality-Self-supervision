Lung volumes remain low improved aeration but residual atelectasis at both lung bases. There has been interval development of a low attenuation 2.8 cm elliptical opacity in the right mid lung which may reflect loculated fluid within the minor fissure or pleural space. Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
