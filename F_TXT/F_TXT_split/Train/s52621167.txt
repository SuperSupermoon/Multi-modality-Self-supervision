Marked leftward patient rotation limits assessment of cardiomediastinal contours. Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by apparent worsening of perihilar edema. Additionally, a worsening area of more localized opacity is seen in the left retrocardiac region with increased obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. This could be due to either atelectasis or developing pneumonia. Followup non-rotated radiograph would be helpful for more complete evaluation of this region.
