A stent has been placed within the right main bronchus, with no radiographic evidence of complications such as pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Improving opacities are present within the right middle and lower lobes, as well as slight improvement in the left lower lobe opacity. Left juxtahilar opacity is unchanged as well as right-sided pleural opacities. A small left pleural effusion is also similar.
