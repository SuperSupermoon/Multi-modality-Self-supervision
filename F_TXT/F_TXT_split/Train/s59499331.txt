As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The patient remains intubated and the nasogastric tube remains in situ. Also unchanged is the right chest tube and the appearance of the post-operative location at the right lung bases. There is ongoing minimal blunting, probably caused by a small pleural effusion, combined to some atelectasis. No larger pneumothorax is seen. A minimal right medial hyperlucency could reflect small anterior pneumothorax. Unchanged appearance of the heart and of the left lung.
