There are bilateral mid to lower lung opacities which may reflect aspiration, infection or hemorrhage. The lungs appear hyperinflated which may reflect emphysema, and bilateral small pleural effusions are noted. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette are unremarkable. A NG tube is seen terminating within the proximal stomach, and the side port appears to be at the GE junction. The ET tube is in appropriate position.
