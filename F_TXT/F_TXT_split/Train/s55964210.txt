There is a small pneumothorax on the left. A left-sided pleural effusion is moderate in size with probable associated atelectasis at the left lung base. The pleural effusion is somewhat decreased in size, however. The pulmonary vasculature is indistinct and the interstitium mildly prominent suggesting mild pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion on the right. The pleural catheter is suboptimally visualized but projects over the left lower chest. Impression: Small left-sided pneumothorax. Decreased left pleural effusion. Suboptimal visualization of pleural catheter positioning; a follow-up chest study with PA and lateral views may be helpful to better characterize and document positioning if needed clinically.
