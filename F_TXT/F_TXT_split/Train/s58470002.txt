The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal contours may be slightly shifted to the left rather than exaggeration by patient rotation. Again is noted a small right apical pneumothorax with gas also tracking along the lateral and inferior portions of the pleural space. There does not appear to be right hemidiaphragmatic flattening. The lungs are clear with a suture chain in the right apex. There is no pleural effusion.
