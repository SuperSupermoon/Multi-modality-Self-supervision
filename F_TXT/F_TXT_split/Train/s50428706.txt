Again seen are perihilar opacity that appears slightly increased as compared to the prior study, which may be due to worsening pulmonary edema. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which is more prominent, query subpulmonic effusion or ascites. There is left base opacity concerning for pleural effusion with atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain stable.
