Lung volumes are low. Heart size appears borderline enlarged. The aorta is mildly tortuous and diffusely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present as a result of low lung volumes. Attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings towards the upper lobes is compatible with underlying emphysema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Patient is status post kyphoplasty of a mid and lower thoracic vertebral body.
