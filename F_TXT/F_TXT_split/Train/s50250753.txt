As compared to the previous image, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are constant. Unchanged bilateral atelectatic opacities, likely left pneumothorax and massive air collections in the soft tissues that limit the assessment of finer details in the lung parenchyma. No new parenchymal opacities.
