As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient remains intubated and a nasogastric tube is seen. The right PICC line is in unchanged position. In the interval, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, caused by a combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis, have decreased in severity in extent. The cardiac silhouette has also minimally decreased in size. No new opacities. No pneumothorax.
