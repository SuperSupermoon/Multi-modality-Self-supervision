In comparison with study of ___, the left pigtail catheter is in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. The opacification at the right base is less prominent than on the previous study. At the left base, there is continued and possibly increasing opacification, consistent with some combination of volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion.
