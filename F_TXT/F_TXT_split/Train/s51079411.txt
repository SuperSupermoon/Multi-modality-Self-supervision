Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Bilateral lung consolidations larger on the right side and in the bases are grossly unchanged, consistent with aspiration given the clinical history. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. ET tube is in a standard position. Left PICC tip is in the lower SVC. NG tube is out of view below the diaphragm. The side port is in the stomach. Bilateral effusions are unchanged. There are no new lung abnormalities.
