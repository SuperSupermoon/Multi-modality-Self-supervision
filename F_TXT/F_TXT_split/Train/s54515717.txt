Progressive elevation of the left hemidiaphragm by reflects atelectasis in the left lower lobe. There is also considerable vascular engorgement in the left lung, all pointing to poor clearance of secretions and edema due to the diminished ventilatory excursion. Whether patient is aspirating or the hemidiaphragm is dysfunctional might be distinguishable by ultrasound evaluation of diaphragmatic motion. Stomach is moderately distended. I cannot tell whether an esophageal tube is in place. Right lung is clear. Heart is mildly enlarged, exaggerated by low lung volumes. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion on the left is mild.
