AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Different size of tracheostomy cannula now in place, but in unchanged correct position. No evidence of pneumothorax or suspicious findings for mediastinal emphysema. The pulmonary vasculature is unchanged, seen on these portable chest examinations. No pneumothorax can be identified. Evaluation of the mediastinal structures was made with changing penetration pattern in the computer and one was able to identify again the central airway stent of the right side in unchanged position. The stent is approximately 2 cm long and is located in a position indicating main bronchus to the right lower lobe and middle lobe. No new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates have developed can be identified on this single view comparative study.
