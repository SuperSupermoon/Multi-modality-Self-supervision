A right central venous catheter ends in the upper superior vena cava. Two upper enteric tubes end off of the radiograph. Compared to the prior radiograph, performed 1 day prior, new increased density in the right lung likely represents increase in a moderate right pleural effusion. A small left pleural effusion has also increased in size. Early interstitial edema is present in the left lung. The lung volumes are low. Bilateral lower lobe opacities most likely represent atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
