The cardio mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unchanged in comparison to prior film. There is again seen a calcified thoracic aorta. The bilateral hila are normal. There has been interval development of a left lower lobe/retrocardiac opacity, possibly with a visualized air bronchogram, which obscures the left hemidiaphragm. Additionally, there is loss of definition of the right hemidiaphragm. There are also small bilateral pleural effusions. This may represent new left lower lobe or possibly bilateral lower lobe aspiration versus pneumonia, especially given clinical context. This appearance could also simply represent bibasilar relaxation atelectasis secondary to small bilateral pleural effusions. There are no pneumothoraces.
