The patient is markedly rotated to her right limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. The tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. Left subclavian PICC line remains unchanged in position. There are likely bilateral effusions, left much greater than the right, which do not appear to be changed. There continues to be patchy airspace disease, more on the left than the right, but again suggestive of atelectasis rather than an infectious process. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Bilateral rib fractures. Cardiac stent remains in place.
