As compared to the previous radiograph, the malposition of the endotracheal tube in the right main bronchus is reversed. The tip of the endotracheal tube now projects 4 cm above the carina. A linear lucency overlying the left heart border is caused by a skinfold. The lung volumes have decreased. The pre-existing opacity in the right mid and lower lung is constant in appearance. Moderate pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac atelectasis. No new parenchymal opacity. The nasogastric tube and the right internal jugular vein catheter are in unchanged position.
