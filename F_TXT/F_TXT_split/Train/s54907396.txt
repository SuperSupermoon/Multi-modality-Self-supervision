Right PICC tip terminates in the proximal right atrium. There are low lung volumes. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The aorta is tortuous and calcified, unchanged. The hilar contours are stable, and no pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. Patchy opacities within the lung bases have improved compared to the prior study, with residual interstitial opacity is in the left lung base likely reflective of atelectasis but infection is not excluded. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified. There are multiple surgical ___ projecting over the left axilla.
