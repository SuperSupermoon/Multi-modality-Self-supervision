Portable AP upright view of the chest was provided. Lung volumes are low with mild pulmonary edema noted. Patient is rotated to the right, which somewhat limits the evaluation. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Heart size cannot be assessed. The mediastinal contour is also difficult to assess due to patient rotation to the right. The bony structures are intact.
