Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There has been placement of a feeding tube whose distal tip is pointing cranially but is in the fundus of the stomach. There is volume loss on the left side and atelectasis of the right middle and lower lobe. This appears to have increased since the prior study. There is a right IJ central venous line with distal lead tip in the mid SVC. The left lung demonstrates some atelectasis at lung bases. There are no pneumothoraces.
