Left subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position with its tip at the cavoatrial junction. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Lung volumes remain low but there has been interval improvement in the pulmonary edema. A residual patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region is again seen and may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No pneumothorax. Two surgical clips at the left lung apex.
