Tip of endotracheal tube is within 1.5 cm of the carina, but note is made of flexed position of the patient's neck which likely accounts for greater excursion. Attention to this area on repeat chest radiograph with neck in neutral position would be helpful. Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular structures. Increasing patchy and linear opacities at both lung bases are present, and favor atelectasis with or without coexisting aspiration. Probable small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
