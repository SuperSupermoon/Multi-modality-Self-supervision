There are no old films available for comparison. Right upper quadrant clips are present. The right humerus is superiorly subluxed. There is some increased opacity in the right inferior hilum that could represent a calcified node. The right paratracheal stripe is also prominent that could be due to vascular changes or adenopathy. There are increased lung markings at the right base, but no definite infiltrate. A lateral film would be helpful when the patient is able.
