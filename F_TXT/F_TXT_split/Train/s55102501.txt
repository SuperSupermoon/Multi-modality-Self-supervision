The endotracheal tube is unchanged in position, although the carina is not well seen on this study. The right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC, and the right PICC ends in the lower SVC. The new Dobbhoff tube ends with the tip just beyond the diaphragm in the proximal stomach. Otherwise, pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged with bibasilar atelectasis. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are stable.
