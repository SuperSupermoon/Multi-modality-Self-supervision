As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the middle to distant parts of the stomach. The right catheter is in unchanged position in the internal jugular vein. Moderate cardiomegaly that is unchanged. Increasing bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely suggesting moderate pulmonary edema, combined with small bilateral pleural effusions. Subsequent areas of atelectasis at the lung bases. No pneumothorax.
