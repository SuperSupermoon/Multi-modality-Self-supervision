The patient remains intubated. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach. The right hemidiaphragm is now somewhat obscured with new vague opacification projecting over the right lower lung but sparing the right cardiac border. Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear. There is no definite pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
