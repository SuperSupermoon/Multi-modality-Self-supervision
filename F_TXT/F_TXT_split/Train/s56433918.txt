AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained eight hours earlier during the same day. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position terminating the trachea some 6 cm above the level of the carina. One NG tube can be identified, seen to pass through the esophagus and reaching well into the abdominal area. A previously existing wide caliber right internal jugular approach line has been removed. No pneumothorax has developed. The lung fields are grossly clear on this portable supine chest examination without evidence of any central airway obstruction or major atelectasis. Mild blunting of the right lateral pleural sinus is noted. Crowded appearance of basal vascular structures suggests the presence of plate atelectasis, but this finding has not progressed significantly. The pulmonary vasculature does not show evidence of central pulmonary edema.
