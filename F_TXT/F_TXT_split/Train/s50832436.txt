The patient is markedly rotated limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. A right subclavian PICC line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. Overall, there is less edema and improved aeration throughout. A layering left effusion and likely a smaller right effusion are again seen.
