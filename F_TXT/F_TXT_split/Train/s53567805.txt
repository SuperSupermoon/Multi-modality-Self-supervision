Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm from the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and outside field of view within the stomach. There is mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Minimally displaced right lateral fourth and fifth rib fractures and left posterior seventh rib fractures are likely related to recent chest compressions.
