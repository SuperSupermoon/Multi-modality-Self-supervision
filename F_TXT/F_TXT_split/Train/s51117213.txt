A single AP chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs are well expanded and clear. There is no effusion or pneumothorax. Mild left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis. Minimal interstitial abnormality within the right mid lung field appears to correlate to tree-in-___ opacities on the prior Chest CT, and could reflect chronic aspiration. There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm which is chronic. A stent projects over the gastroesophageal junction and extends into the upper aspect of the stomach. Dual cardiac pacing leads are in stable position.
