AP chest compared to ___, 5:53 p.m. and 8:02 p.m.: Right internal jugular sheath has been removed. Upper enteric drainage catheter and enteric feeding tube, endotracheal tube, and left subclavian vascular line are all in standard placements, unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette has a normal postoperative appearance. Mild-to-moderate left lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion have both increased. No pneumothorax. Fracture deformity of the proximal right third rib is probably chronic since it predates sternotomy. Right lung is clear and there is no appreciable right pleural effusion.
