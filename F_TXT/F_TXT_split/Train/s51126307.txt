Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The tracheostomy is in place, with the tracheostomy tip being approximately 4 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is very high, in the mid esophagus and should be further advanced. Successful placement is demonstrated on the subsequent study. Bibasal atelectasis and low lung volumes are noted as well as mild vascular engorgement.
