In comparison with the earlier study of this date, following bronchoscopy there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist though there may be some improvement since the prior study. Again, this most likely represents multifocal pneumonia with some element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
