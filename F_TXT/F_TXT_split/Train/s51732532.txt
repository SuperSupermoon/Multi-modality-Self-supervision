As compared to the prior study, the patient was positioned slightly differently, and his aortic arch appears to be on the current study unchanged as well as the adjacent opacity that most likely reflects pulmonary arteries. Since the current examination positioning is identical to ___, thus the more symmetric previous study most likely reflects positional changes rather than true abnormality. On the other hand, repeated more AP radiograph would be beneficial for definitive exclusion ___ ___-___ abnormality. Left basal consolidation and pulmonary edema appear to be unchanged.
