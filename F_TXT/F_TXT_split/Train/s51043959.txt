A right pleurx catheter and right port-a-cath appear in place. There has been an interval decrease in right sided pleural effusion with improved aeration of the right lung base. There is a slight apical lucency which may be representative of a tiny right apical pneumothorax. There is no shift of the midline structures. The lungs are without a focal consolidation. Cardiac silhouette appears unchanged.
