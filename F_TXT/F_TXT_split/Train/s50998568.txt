Portable upright chest radiograph was provided. A left chest wall dual-lead pacemaker is seen with leads in the right ventricle and right atrium. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Lung volumes are slightly low. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Prominent interstitial markings at the lung bases are unchanged since the prior studies, likely representing NSIP and better assessed on the recent chest CT. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is notable for a tortuous and calcified aorta. The heart is minimally enlarged.
