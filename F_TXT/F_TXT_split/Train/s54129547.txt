ET tube in standard placement, tip 3.5 cm above the carina. Esophageal drainage tube would need to be advanced at least 15 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach and loops in the hypopharynx should be reduced. Right internal jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. Moderate to large left pleural effusion is unchanged over the past several days, quite likely loculated. Is responsible for extensive atelectasis at the left base. Peripheral right lung lesion sitting just inferior to the minor fissure, has been present without appreciable change for more than a week. No pneumothorax.
