A right-sided central venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely represents a small pleural effusion. There is atelectasis at the right lung base. Retrocardiac opacity and blunting of the left costophrenic angle is also likely secondary to pleural effusion with associated atelectasis; however, an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited by bilateral opacities. No pneumothorax identified. Surgical clips seen in the left upper chest.
