There is again seen a 4.2 cm rounded opacity within the left mid lung fields which has been reported as a loculated fissural pleural effusion. This appears stable since the radiographs from yesterday and slightly decreased from ___. There is tortuosity of thoracic aorta. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Calcified 5 mm granuloma at the left base is again seen. Old healed right posterior rib fracture is seen. Lungs are grossly clear without focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or large pleural effusions. There are no pneumothoraces.
