Bilateral internal jugular central lines and feeding tube are unchanged in position, although the tip of the feeding tube is not identified on the current study. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Worsening mild perihilar and interstitial edema. Increasing retrocardiac consolidation in the setting of a layering effusion likely reflects compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered. No obvious pneumothorax.
