ET tube is approximately 5.6 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is noted with side port within the expected region of the stomach. Bilateral basilar opacities are improved on the right and persist on the left compared to the study obtained approximately 7 hours earlier. Reading the present study in conjunction with the earlier chest radiograph, findings may represent pulmonary edema on the right which has improved (correlate with history of diuresis) and aspiration pneumonitis versus pneumonia on the left.
