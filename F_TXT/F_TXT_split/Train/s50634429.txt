Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip and side port projecting over the stomach. A right internal jugular Port-A-Cath remains in place with its tip in the distal SVC. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is increasing opacity at the right apex which may be related to patient positioning although other processes such as pleural or parenchymal hemorrhage, atelectasis or developing pneumonia should be considered. This can be further assessed on followup imaging. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
