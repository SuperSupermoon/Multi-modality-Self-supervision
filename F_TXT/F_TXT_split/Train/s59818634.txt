Rotated positioning. Tracheostomy tube in place. Right IJ line tip over distal SVC. Right-sided chest tube is present. The chest tube extends to the apex of the right lung. A suture line is seen the base of the right apex and there is relative lucency above this, with paucity of vessels. This presumably represents a site of postoperative air/pneumothorax. The appearance is similar to recent prior films, allowing for differences in positioning. Also again seen are lucent locules at the base of the right lung, which have been previously attributed to pneumothoraces. Allowing for differences in positioning, I doubt gross interval change in the knees sees at the base of the lung. Again noted is a rounded density abutting the lower right chest wall, similar prior. As before, there is prominence of the right hilum and mild prominence of vessels about the right hilum with slight surrounding hazy opacity. There additional sites of sutures in the right mid lung. These are all similar to the prior study. The left lung shows a small left effusion, unchanged. Allowing for iatrogenic materials overlying the left lung apex, the left lung remains grossly clear. The known left apical suture line is faintly seen. Possibility of a small left apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded.
