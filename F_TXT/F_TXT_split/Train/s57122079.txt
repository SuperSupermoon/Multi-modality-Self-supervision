AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with a similar preceding examination obtained one day earlier. The findings are completely unchanged. Port-A-Cath system as before. Heart size and mediastinal structures are unchanged. Crowded pulmonary vasculature, as before, indicating poor inspirational effort, but no evidence of any new parenchymal infiltrates. Diaphragmatic contours well delineated and lateral pleural sinuses are free.
