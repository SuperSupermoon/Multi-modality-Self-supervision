As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. There is unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette but the diameter of the vasculature in the lungs has decreased, reflecting decrease in pulmonary edema. Moderate atelectasis at the left lung bases. No newly occurred parenchymal opacities.
