There are no prior studies available for comparison. Pulmonary edema is mild to moderate. Cardiomegaly cannot be assessed. Bilateral pleural effusions are small on the right and moderate on the left associated with adjacent atelectasis. Right infrahilar opacities could be due to asymmetric edema or pneumonia. Followup is recommended. There is no pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Sternal wires are aligned. There is a probably calcified lymph node in the left hilum.
