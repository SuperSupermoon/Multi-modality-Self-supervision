In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are stable. Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits. The pulmonary vessels are not as clearly seen, suggesting some possible mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Increased opacification at the right base is consistent with atelectatic changes. There is some coalescent opacification in the left infrahilar region and left base, which was not appreciated on the previous study, consistent with developing aspiration pneumonia.
