Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from earlier the same day at 4:11 p.m. Endotracheal tube is now seen with tip approximately 4 cm from the carina. Enteric tube is now seen with tip potentially within the stomach versus passing below the inferior field of view, in appropriate position. There are now bilateral patchy parenchymal opacities, which could be due to pulmonary edema or potentially aspiration given rapid interval development. Component of infection, particularly on the left is also possible as this was present on prior. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
