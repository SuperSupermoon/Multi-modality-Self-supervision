Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities consistent with pulmonary edema, which is stable as compared to the prior study. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The endotracheal tube ends 4.1 cm from the carina. A left-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the persistent left SVC. An orogastric feeding tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view.
