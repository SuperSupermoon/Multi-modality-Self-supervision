There is a layering right effusion with associated patchy airspace disease in the right mid and lower lung which would be concerning for pneumonia given its focality. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and left subclavian central line are unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Left lung is grossly clear.
