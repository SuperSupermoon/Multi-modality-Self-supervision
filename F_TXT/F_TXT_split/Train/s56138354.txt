The patient is status post previous left upper lobe resection. Postoperative alterations in the left hemithorax are similar to the prior study. Previously present left basilar opacity has improved, and likely represents resolving atelectasis with adjacent small effusion. Right lung is grossly clear except for linear atelectasis or scar at the base. The right humeral head appears dislocated, and has been more fully evaluated by separately dictated chest radiograph.
