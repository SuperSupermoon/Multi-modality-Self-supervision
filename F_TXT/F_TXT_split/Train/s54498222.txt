AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung is more severe today than on ___ and consolidation in the left lower lobe has worsened accompanied by increasing small left pleural effusion. Overall the findings are most consistent with multifocal pneumonia and/or bleeding in areas of previous lung trauma if there is a bleeding diathesis, such as thrombocytopenia. Cardiac size is top normal, but unchanged. Upper lungs show no evidence of pulmonary edema nor is the mediastinum widened by venous engorgement. Dr. ___ was paged at 10:29 a.m., when the findings were recognized, and we discussed the findings by telephone at 10:30a.m. and subsequently at 11:00a.m. we discussed the need for another imaging procedure to assess the ascending thoracic aorta, especially TEE.
