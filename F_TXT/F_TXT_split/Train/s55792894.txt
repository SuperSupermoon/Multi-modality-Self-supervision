Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.1 cm above the chronic. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm terminating in the left upper quadrant, in the expected location of the stomach. The patient is rotated to the right. Prominence of the pulmonary arteries may relate to pulmonary hypertension. Streaky left basilar opacity is seen most likely due to atelectasis/scarring rather than consolidation although aspiration would be a consideration. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. Surgical clips are noted along the right peritracheal region.
