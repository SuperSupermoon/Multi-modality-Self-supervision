Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. Increased interstitial markings and engorged pulmonary vasculature is consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
