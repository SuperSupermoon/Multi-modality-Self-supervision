Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Extensive bilateral lung opacities, worse on the right lung, are unchanged consistent with multifocal aspiration pneumonia. Bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right side, are grossly unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Right PICC tube tip is in the lower SVC.
