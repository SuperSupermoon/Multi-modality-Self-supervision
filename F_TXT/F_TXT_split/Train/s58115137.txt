Endotracheal tube tip terminates 3 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube tip is within the stomach. Heart size is normal. The aortic knob calcifications are demonstrated. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Fullness of both hila may suggest underlying pulmonary arterial enlargement. Lungs appear hyperinflated which could reflect underlying COPD. There appears to be mild cephalization of pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion. Punctate radiopaque densities projecting over the right lung base may be due to prior aspiration of barium. The left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No large pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is seen.
