The ET tube tip is approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. Left mediastinal shift is demonstrated, consistent with known bronchial obstruction and Atelectasis, although note is made that there is substantial worsening as compared to most prior chest radiograph and chest CT. Widespread consolidations are noted bilaterally, on the right and grossly unchanged, on the left difficult to evaluate due to the overlying atelectasis. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.
