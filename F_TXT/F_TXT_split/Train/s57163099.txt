As compared to the previous radiograph, the wire has been removed from the left-sided PICC line. The course of the line appears to be normal, but the tip is difficult to visualize, notably because of substantial patient rotation. A repeat radiograph, if possible in frontal and lateral projection, is recommended. Bilateral areas of plate-like atelectasis. Status post vertebroplasty. No evidence of pneumothorax.
