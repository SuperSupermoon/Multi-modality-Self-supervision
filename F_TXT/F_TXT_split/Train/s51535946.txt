Since the prior studies, there has been significant interval increase in diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, right greater than left, with differential diagnosis including severe multifocal infection, aspiration, significant progression of pulmonary metastatic disease, lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Superimposed pulmonary edema is not excluded. The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image, but no large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable and stable.
