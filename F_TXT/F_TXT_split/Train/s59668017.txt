As compared to the previous radiograph, the left PIC line and the left chest tube are in unchanged position. Nevertheless, however, the pleural effusion on the left has increased. The extent of the effusion is now severe, with only a small area of ventilated lung parenchyma remaining at the left lung apex. The effusion causes displacement of the mediastinal structures to the right. Newly appeared is a small right basal parenchymal opacity, likely reflecting atelectasis. However, in the appropriate clinical history, developing pneumonia could be another differential diagnosis and, as a consequence, repeat radiograph should be performed.
