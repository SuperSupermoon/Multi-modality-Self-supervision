In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval change. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the bases with coarse interstitial markings consistent with chronic pulmonary disease, elevated pulmonary venous pressure, or both. There is suggestion of some vague increased opacification in the left suprahilar region. This could possibly reflect a developing area of aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.
