Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Mild bibasilar atelectasis is present. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation. The endotracheal tube ends 8.6 cm from the carina, and should be advanced for more secure seating. A nasogastric tube is seen with the tip ending at the GE junction.
