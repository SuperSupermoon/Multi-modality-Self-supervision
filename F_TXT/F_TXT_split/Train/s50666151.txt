Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Increased opacification in the right hemithorax suggests increasing in small right pleural effusion. If any, there is a small left effusion, there is no evident pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Left lower lobe atelectasis has improved. ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper SVC. Esophageal stent is in unchanged position. Mild vascular congestion is stable.
