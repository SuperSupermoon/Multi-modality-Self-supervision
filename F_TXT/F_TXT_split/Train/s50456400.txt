Overall aeration of the lungs appear similar compared to recent radiograph from ___, though with slightly increased non-specific opacification at the right base. The chronic bibasilar opacities may be related to chronic atelectasis and pleural masses/fluid. Slightly worsening at the right base could be due to progressive atelectasis, increased pleural fluid or superimposed infection/aspiration, worsening disease. Attention on follow-up is recommended. No pneumothorax is identified. There is no evidence of superimposed pulmonary edema. Lung apices are clear. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
