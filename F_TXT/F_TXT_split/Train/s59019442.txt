There is interval decrease in left pleural effusion with possible very trace remaining. There has been resolution in the right pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is linear opacity at the left mid lung, which may be due to atelectasis.
