Portable single AP view of the chest with the patient in supine position was obtained. There appears to be worsening opacification in the left lung base that may be explained by increased accumulation of fluid or volume loss though could also be related to patient's supine positioning and low lung volumes. Again seen are stable nodular pleural thickening in the left lower lung field and left hilar fullness consistent with known metastatic disease. The right lung is essentially clear with mildly engorged vessels, which could be due to congestion or low lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax. The heart size is difficult to assess given parenchymal abnormalities.
