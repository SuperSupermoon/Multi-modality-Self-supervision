AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are lower, exaggerating moderate cardiomegaly, but there appears to be increased caliber to mediastinal veins suggesting elevated central venous pressure. Opacification in the left lower lobe persists, probably atelectasis since the hemidiaphragm appears to be elevated. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable. ET tube is in standard placement. Nasogastric drainage tube can be traced only as far as the lower esophagus and may need substantial repositioning to put it into the stomach. Right PIC line ends in the right atrium. No pneumothorax. Healed fracture of left humerus may be responsible for both distortion and degeneration.
