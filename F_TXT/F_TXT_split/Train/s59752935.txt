There is new asymmetrical elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which suggests a component of volume loss in the right lower lobe, likely accounting for the opacity at the right base. A small right pleural effusion is present. Left lung appears hyperinflated. Heart does not appear enlarged. No pneumothorax.
