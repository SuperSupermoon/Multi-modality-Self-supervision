1. Right internal jugular Port-A-Cath remains in place with the tip projecting in the proximal right atrium, unchanged. The graft within the proximal aorta is stable in appearance. Lung volumes have somewhat decreased and there continue to be stable areas of fibrotic change. The lung volumes have diminished and there are patchy opacities, slightly more prominent at both lung bases, likely reflecting atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. No large effusions. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac contours are stable. Residual air within the right lateral chest wall soft tissues and neck consistent with subcutaneous emphysema.
