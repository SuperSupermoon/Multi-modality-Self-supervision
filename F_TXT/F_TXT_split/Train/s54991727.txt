Heart size is normal. Mediastinal silhouette is slightly different from the previous study due to opacity surrounding the aortic arch, potentially representing atelectasis. In addition there are multifocal consolidations involving left lung and to lesser extent right lower lobe, concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Small amount of pleural effusion is most likely present. There is no pneumothorax. No definitive evidence of pulmonary edema is present. If clinically warranted, correlation with chest CT is to be considered.
