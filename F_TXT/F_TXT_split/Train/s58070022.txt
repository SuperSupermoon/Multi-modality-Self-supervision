Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right pleural catheter in unchanged position. There is minimal residual right pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. Linear atelectasis in the right midlung is unchanged. A small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Mild vascular congestion is slightly improved from the prior study. Widening of the mediastinum on the right corresponds with lymphadenopathy seen on the CT.
