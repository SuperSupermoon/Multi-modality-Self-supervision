In comparison to the chest CT obtained 1 day prior, moderate right pleural effusion is improved. There is a new, right sided pigtail catheter with a tiny apical pneumothorax. Right upper lobe consolidation is probably unchanged, but better appreciated on recent CT chest. Complete opacification of the left hemithorax with rightward mediastinal shift is unchanged and consistent with known massive pleural effusion. Large pericardial effusion also better appreciated on recent CT chest.
