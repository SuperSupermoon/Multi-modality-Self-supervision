In comparison with the study of ___, the Dobbhoff tube extends to the lower body or antrum of the stomach. The endotracheal tube again remains at the upper clavicular level. Atelectatic changes are seen in the retrocardiac region. It is difficult to assess the right apical region because of overlapping bony structures. This area should be assessed on subsequent studies to see whether there is continued opacification in this region.
