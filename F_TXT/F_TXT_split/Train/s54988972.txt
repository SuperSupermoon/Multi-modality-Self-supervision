As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes and the size of the cardiac silhouette are unchanged. Also unchanged is the position of the tracheostomy tube. The opacities at the left lung base, likely combined to a small left pleural effusion, are constant in appearance and severity. The opacities could reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or a combination of the two. The right lung bases and the right lung in general continued to be unremarkable. No evidence of pneumothorax.
