The patient is intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 6.6 cm above the carina. The tube could be advanced by 1 to 2 cm. Patient also has a nasogastric tube that should be advanced, given that the sidehole is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. Normal lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly and mild bilateral areas of atelectasis at the lung bases, right more than left. The opacity at the right lung base, however, could also represent early pneumonia. Therefore, close radiographic followup should be performed. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
