In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the level of the distal antrum. Endotracheal tube tip is unchanged. Continued low lung volumes with the cardiac silhouette at the upper limits of normal. No definite evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. Some prominence in the left hilar region probably represents normal pulmonary vessels that are seen because of difference in obliquity of the patient.
