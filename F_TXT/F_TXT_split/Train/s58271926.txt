Left PICC line ends in the mid SVC and the NG tube extends post-pyloric. The left lower lung opacity is not significantly changed from prior. There has been worsening of the right lower lung volume loss with basilar opacification which could represent collapse, aspiration or pneumonia. The right costophrenic angle is excluded from this study. No left pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new from prior exam.
