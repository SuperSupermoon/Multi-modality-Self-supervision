Endotracheal tube has its tip 2.8 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip and side port projecting over the stomach. There continues to be bilateral diffuse airspace disease which appears slightly improved suggesting a component of superimposed edema in the setting of ARDS or a diffuse infection. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-erect technique. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
