Portable semi-upright chest radiograph was obtained. AICD device is unchanged with tip extending into the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle. Midline sternotomy wires and multiple mediastinal clips are again noted. Diffuse pulmonary ground-glass opacities are most likely secondary to pulmonary edema. There is a small right pleural effusion. A tiny left pleural effusion cannot be entirely excluded. Cardiomegaly is stable. No pneumothorax. Bony structures appear intact.
