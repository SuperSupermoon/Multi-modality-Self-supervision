In comparison with the study of ___, there has been an extensive spinal surgical procedure performed. Again there is some engorgement of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. No definite acute focal pneumonia.

Nasogastric tube is in place though the tip can be followed only to the lower esophagus where it crosses the lower margin of the image.
