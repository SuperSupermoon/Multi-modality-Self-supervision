Nasogastric tube appears to course below the diaphragm, but the tip extends beyond the image margin. Endotracheal tube terminates 5.9 cm above the carina. Right PICC terminates in the right atrium. Left PICC terminates in the low SVC. Stable, moderate cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax. Unchanged ground-glass opacities in the right lower lobe could reflect developing aspiration pneumonia. Persistent retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis. Stable, moderate, layering left pleural effusion.
