Since a recent radiograph of earlier today, an endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been successfully repositioned. A coiled portion of the nasogastric tube overlies of the neck of the patient and is likely external to the patient, but clinical correlation is suggested to exclude internal coiling. Otherwise similar radiographic appearance of the chest when consideration is made of positional and technical differences between the exams.
