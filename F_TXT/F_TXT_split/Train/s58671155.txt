Single portable view of the chest. There is slightly increased interstitial marking seen throughout the lungs, the chronicity of which is uncertain given lack of prior. There is a more focal region of opacity projecting over the left mid lung. Its etiology is uncertain and it could be due to confluence of shadows including the scapula. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Atherosclerotic calcifications seen in the aorta.
