The patient is rotated somewhat to the left. The PAC is noted overlying the left lateral upper hemithorax. There is a relative opacity projecting over the left mid-to-lower lung, possibly in the lingula which could relate to patient positioning, underlying consolidation due to an infection or contusion given not excluded. No pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Thoracic scoliosis is noted.
