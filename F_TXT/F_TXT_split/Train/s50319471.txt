Tip of endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.5 cm above the carinal with the neck in a flexed position. A catheter is also noted within the proximal esophagus and most likely represents an esophageal temperature probe, but clinical correlation suggested to exclude a malpositioned orogastric tube. Stable cardiomediastinal widening. Unchanged small pleural effusions. No new focal areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
