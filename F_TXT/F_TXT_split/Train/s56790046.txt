The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiac silhouette is accentuated due to underinflation of the lungs, but likely top normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable on this supine view. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
