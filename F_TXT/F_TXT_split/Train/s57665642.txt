Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has increased in size since prior chest radiograph. Triangular opacity obscuring right heart border and hemidiaphragm is probably due to a combination of loculated fluid and adjacent right middle and right lower lobe atelectasis. Left lung is clear. Small left pleural effusion is also noted.
