Given differences in positioning, there is improving aeration in the right lung status post bronchoscopy. There are bilateral layering effusions with bibasilar opacities suggestive of residual atelectasis or possibly aspiration, right greater than left. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. Hardware is again seen overlying the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. Incidental note is made of an azygos lobe. The left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the azygos vein and should be pulled back 2-3 cm.
