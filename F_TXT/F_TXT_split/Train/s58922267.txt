Large mass contiguous with aortic arch is consistent with known pseudoaneurysm and appears similar to the prior radiograph. Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and increasing interstitial edema. Marked improved aeration in left lower lobe with associated decrease in small left pleural effusion, but moderate right pleural effusion appears similar.
