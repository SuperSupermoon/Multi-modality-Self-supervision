In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a left pleural catheter remains in place with no definite pneumothorax, although external tubing partially obscures the left apex, limiting assessment of this region. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged, but adjacent parenchymal opacities in the left retrocardiac region have slightly worsened. Heterogeneous opacities in the right lung are minimally improved in the interval particularly at the right apex. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
