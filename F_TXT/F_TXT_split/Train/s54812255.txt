Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic. Heterogeneous opacification developing at the lung bases is probably worsening interstitial edema accompanied by increasing small right pleural effusion. Mild cardiomegaly is essentially stable. No pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced at least 5 cm to move all the side ports below the diaphragm.
