The lung volumes remain low. Bibasilar consolidations and small amount of pleural effusion is unchanged. Right lower lung consolidation seen on this chest CT appears to be visible but decreased in size since the prior study. No pneumothorax is seen. The ET tube tip is approximately 5.6 cm above the carina. The NG tube passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. The right internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium. Currently no appreciable pulmonary edema is demonstrated.
