New endotracheal tube in standard placement. Esophageal tube ends in the upper portion of the mildly distended stomach. Lung volumes have improved substantially, an the interstitial pulmonary abnormality has diminished. The extent to which larger lung volumes decreases the radiographic conspicuity of any interstitial pneumonia is difficult to say the data raises the possibility that some of the abnormality was due to mild pulmonary edema. Increased trans pleural pressure is probably responsible for a decrease in heart size. Pleural effusion is minimal if any. No pneumothorax. .
