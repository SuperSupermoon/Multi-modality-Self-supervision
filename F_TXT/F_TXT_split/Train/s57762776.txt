As compared to the previous radiograph, there is evidence of increasing pleural effusion, combined to mild left and retrocardiac atelectasis. On the right, no effusion is visible. There is moderate cardiomegaly with minimal widening of the right aspects of the mediastinum, potentially suggestive of mild fluid overload. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
