ET tube ends 6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is within the stomach but the side port is in the lower esophagus. There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Compared with yesterday's radiograph there is new opacification at the right base which likely represents pleural effusion and atelectasis. There is also new shift of the heart to the right; however, there is no evidence of left pneumothorax or flattening of the diaphragm or other evidence of tension, instead this shift is related to volume loss in the right lower lobe.
