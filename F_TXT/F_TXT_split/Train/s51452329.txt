Heart is upper limits of normal in size and the thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous. Lung volumes are slightly increased with relative flattening of the hemidiaphragms suggesting the possibility of COPD. Several well-marginated calcifications are present most notably in the periphery of the left upper hemithorax in along the left hemidiaphragm contours, suggestive of calcified pleural plaques. Bilateral healed rib fractures are present and note is made of a asymmetric opacity at the right lung base adjacent to a site of a rib fracture. It is uncertain whether this represents superimposition of healed fractures and adjacent scarring or potentially a discrete lung nodule.
