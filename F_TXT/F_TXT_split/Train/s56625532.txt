In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, pulmonary edema has worsened. There are increased opacities most prominently in the right upper lung and left lower lung, possibly a combination of asymmetric and dependent edema due to mitral regurgitation and volume overload, developing pneumonia, or atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Pleural effusions small, if any. Tracheal stenosis may reflect complications of prior intubation or tracheostomy. The intra-aortic balloon pump is unchanged in position, but approximately 3 cm superior to standard placement. The Swan-Ganz central venous catheter is unchanged in position and terminates in the mid right descending pulmonary artery.
