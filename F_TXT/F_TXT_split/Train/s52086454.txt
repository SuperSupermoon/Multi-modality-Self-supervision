A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea and enteric tube extending below the diaphragm in off the inferior edge of the image, unchanged in position. Heart size remains normal and the lungs well inflated. There are diffuse parenchymal opacities, some of which are due to costochondral cartilage calcification. However, there is underlying parenchymal abnormality with apical scarring. There is no large focal consolidation or edema. Moderate scoliosis is present.
