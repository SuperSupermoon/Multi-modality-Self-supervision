The patient has been extubated, but a tracheostomy tube has been placed. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach, however the side port sits at the level of the GE junction. A right-sided PICC line terminates in the upper SVC. A left basilar airspace opacity containing air bronchograms is not appreciably changed. Scattered reticular nodular opacities, including a rounded opacity at the right base, are in keeping with the known diagnosis of multifocal pneumonia.
