Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a right-sided PICC line whose distal lead tip is at the mid-to-distal SVC. Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal. There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity and left-sided pleural effusion which is stable. Mild prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings is again seen. Overall, these findings are all stable.
