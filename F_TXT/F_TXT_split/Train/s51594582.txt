Compared to the prior study, the Swan-Ganz catheter from the right internal jugular approach has been pulled back with its tip in the right main pulmonary artery. The left internal jugular central venous catheter has its tip in the mid SVC, as before. Endotracheal tube tip is roughly 2 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is below the diaphragm and the inferior aspect of the film. As before, there are moderate pleural effusions, right greater than left, with basilar atelectasis and apparent diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema, unchanged. Cardiomegaly persists.
