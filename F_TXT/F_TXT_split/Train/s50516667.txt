Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is demonstrated. The aorta is tortuous and potentially dilated. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized. Multiple clips are seen projecting over the right axillary region. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
