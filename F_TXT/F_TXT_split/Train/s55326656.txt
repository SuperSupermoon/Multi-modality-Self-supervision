Rotated positioning. Left pigtail catheter has been removed. Probable small left apical pneumothorax. Again seen is patchy opacity at the left lung base, likely a combination of collapse/consolidation and pleural fluid. There is also patchy opacity at the right base, similar to prior. Slight upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora is also similar to the prior film. As before, the left hemidiaphragm is elevated.
