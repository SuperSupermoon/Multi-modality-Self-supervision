Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Bilateral pleural effusions have increased slightly over the interval. In the setting of even lower lung volumes and larger pleural effusions, mild pulmoary edema is difficult to exclude. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The endotracheal tube ends 2.2 cm from the carina. The right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends in the right atrium. No pneumothorax. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and of the field of view.
