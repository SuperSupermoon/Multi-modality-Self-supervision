As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has changed in position and the radiograph suffers from a substantial rotational component. A minimal right pleural effusion might be present. The overall size of the cardiac silhouette has not substantially changed. In the retrocardiac lung areas there is a constant atelectasis of the left basal lung regions, potentially aggravated by a hiatal hernia. No overt pulmonary edema. No pneumonia.
