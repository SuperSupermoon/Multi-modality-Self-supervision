The distal tip of the right Swan-___ catheter is again seen in the right pulmonary artery. This could be pulled back 2-3 cm for more optimal placement as described previously. The intra-aortic balloon pump has been removed. There are bilateral pleural effusions, stable. There is persistent pulmonary edema which has improved minimally. Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis is again seen. There are no pneumothoraces.
