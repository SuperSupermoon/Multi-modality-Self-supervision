Compared with ___, an NG-type tube has been placed. The tip is not optimally visualized. Where seen, it overlies the gastric body. The possibility that it extends distal to that is difficult to exclude, even on the edge-enhanced view. No definite extension beyond the pylorus. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Bibasilar atelectasis is slightly more pronounced.
