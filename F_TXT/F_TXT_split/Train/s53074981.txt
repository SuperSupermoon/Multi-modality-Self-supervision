AP portable upright view of the chest. The endotracheal tube is positioned with its tip 4 cm above the carina. An NG tube courses into the upper abdomen just beyond the GE junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent likely due to supine portable technique. The lung volumes are markedly low with possible mild bibasilar atelectasis. No supine evidence for a pneumothorax or large effusion.
