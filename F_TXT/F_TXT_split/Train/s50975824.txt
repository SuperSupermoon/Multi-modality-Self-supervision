AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. There is status post left-sided pulmonary surgery with multiple surgical clips in the left hilar region. General volume loss of the left hemithorax with elevation of the hilar structures, extensive pleural densities occupying the entire apical area. There is moderate elevation of the left-sided diaphragm, but the vascular structures of the left lower lobe do not demonstrate any additional abnormality. The right-sided hemithorax is unremarkable, similar as it was on the preceding examination.
