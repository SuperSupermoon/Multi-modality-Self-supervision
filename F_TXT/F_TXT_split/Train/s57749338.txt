AP chest compared to ___: Lungs are low in volume. ET tube tip is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 8 cm from the carina. It should be advanced 4 cm for more secured seating. Pulmonary vascular caliber is exaggerated by low lung volumes. Heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Caliber of the upper mediastinum is comparable to the pre-operative appearance. Subsequent chest radiograph, 4:53 a.m., available at the time of this review showed standard re-positioning of the endotracheal tube.
