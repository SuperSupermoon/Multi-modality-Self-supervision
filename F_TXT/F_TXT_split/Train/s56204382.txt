As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of bilateral multifocal parenchymal opacities. The opacities are barely changed in extent and severity. The moderate right and minimal left pleural effusion, together with subsequent areas of atelectasis, are unchanged. The central venous access lines are also constant in appearance.
