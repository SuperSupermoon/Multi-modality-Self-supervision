Rotated positioning. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. Compared with the prior film, the right pleural effusion may be slightly smaller. Left pleural effusion is also likely smaller. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. There is CHF, with pulmonary edema. Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is again seen. Tubular structure in right upper quadrant likely represents a tips stent. Additional clips or other radiopaque structures overlie the upper mid abdomen. At the edge of these films, an old right humeral surgical neck fracture is seen, probably only partially united.
