Right basilar pleural catheter remains in place. Patchy opacities at both bases likely reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. A linear opacity at the right apex is felt to be related to something external to the patient as it crosses outside of the hemithorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pulmonary edema. Crowding of the vasculature in the setting of low lung volumes.
