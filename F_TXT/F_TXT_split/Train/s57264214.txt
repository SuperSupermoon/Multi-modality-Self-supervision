There is new dense consolidation of the left lower lobe. Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged. A lateral left lower lobe pulmonary nodule is unchanged, better evaluated on recent CT. Heart size is normal. Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are normal. No pulmonary edema. Incidental note is made of a radiopaque density projecting over the proximal left humerus.
