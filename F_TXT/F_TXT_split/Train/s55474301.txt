No previous images. There has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 1.5 cm above the carina. It should be pulled back about 2 cm. Right subclavian catheter extends to the upper-to-mid SVC. There is an apparent kink at the site of placement. Nasogastric tube extends to the distal stomach and should be pushed forward. The lungs are essentially clear. This information has been conveyed to Dr. ___.
