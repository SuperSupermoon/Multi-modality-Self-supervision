No endotracheal tube is visualized on the current study, per discussion with the covering physician the patient was extubated prior to the radiograph. A right-sided internal jugular catheter is in-situ, the tip is likely in the right atrium and could be withdrawn 2-3 cm. A nasogastric tube is in-situ, the side port is just distal to the expected location of the gastroesophageal junction. No pneumothorax seen. No consolidation or pleural effusion seen.
