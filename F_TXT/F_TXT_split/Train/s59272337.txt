Comparison is made to previous study from ___. Again seen are diffuse airspace opacities throughout both lung fields. There is mild improved aeration at the right base with mild decrease in pleural effusion. There are no pneumothoraces. Endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and right-sided IJ line are stable in position. There is no widening of the vascular pedicle, thus cardiogenic edema is felt less likely to be the cause of these airspace opacities.
