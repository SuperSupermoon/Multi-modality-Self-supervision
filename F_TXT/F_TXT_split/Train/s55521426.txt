Comparison is made with prior study performed 9 hours earlier. Small left apical pneumothorax is unchanged allowing the difference in the positioning of the patient. Small right pneumothorax previously described is not seen in this examination. Right PICC, right chest tube, tracheostomy tube, and enteric tube remain in unchanged position. Multiple surgical clips are in the right apex. Multifocal opacities located in the periphery of the right upper lobe and lower lobes bilaterally are grossly unchanged. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Sternal wires are aligned.
