A tiny left apical pneumothorax remains visible. On the current exam, lucency seen in the left costophrenic angle is again noted --___ much of this is accounted for by a pneumothorax at this time is unclear. Subcutaneous emphysema is probably similar to the prior study. No right-sided pneumothorax is detected. Atelectasis at the left base is similar, but probably slightly more pronounced. Minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region is unchanged. The patient is status post sternotomy. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The known calcified left ventricular aneurysm is again noted.
