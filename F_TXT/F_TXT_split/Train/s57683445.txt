In comparison with the earlier study of this day, there are lower lung volumes. Again there is opacification at the bases consistent with layering effusions and compressive atelectasis. Engorgement of indistinct vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Pacer device is essentially unchanged.
