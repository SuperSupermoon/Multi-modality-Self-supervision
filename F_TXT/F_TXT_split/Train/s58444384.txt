A dialysis catheter terminates in the mid SVC. New linear opacity projecting over the right mid lung likely corresponds to a fluid in the minor fissure. Lung volumes are low. New partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm may be due to subsegmental atelectasis, but infection or aspiration would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no pneumothorax.
