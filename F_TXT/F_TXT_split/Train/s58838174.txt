The patient is status post recent right upper lobe wedge resection with persistent small right apical pneumothorax and small right pleural effusion. Opacities at the resection site have slightly improved, likely due to resolving atelectasis and/or contusion. Within the left hemithorax, a moderate pleural effusion has increased in size with adjacent worsening consolidation and/or atelectasis in the lingula and left lower lobe.
