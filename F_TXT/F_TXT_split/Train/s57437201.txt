The heart is enlarged, not significantly changed from prior examination. Sternotomy wires and mitral valve replacement is noted. Persistent retrocardiac opacity likely relates to a moderate pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. However, an underlying infectious process cannot be excluded. The right lung is essentially clear. No large pleural effusion on the right or pneumothorax identified.
