Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved. Asymmetrically distributed predominantly right mid and lower lung consolidation has worsened in the interval, and is concerning for infectious pneumonia. An asymmetrical distribution of pulmonary edema is less likely. Moderate right pleural effusion has increased in size, but a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged as well as an adjacent left retrocardiac opacity.
