Left mid and lower lung consolidation and right lower medial lung consolidations have minimally worsened over the last 24 hours. Increased retrocardiac density is likely due to a combination of consolidation and/or atelectasis and is unchanged. Left pleural effusion is presumed to be small and stable. Moderately enlarged heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are similar in appearance.
