The cardiac silhouette is top normal, overall stable compared to the prior exams. Again seen are two right pleural catheters seen ending in the medial right thoracic region, overall minimally changed in position compared to the CT from ___. Again seen is the left lingular and lower lobe consolidation, overall slightly worse compared to the chest radiograph from ___; however, better evaluated on the prior CT. There is an overall slightly worse appearance of the aeration of the parenchyma with multiple relatively diffuse multifocal parenchymal opacities and ongoing lung volumes that are low. Bilateral small pleural effusions are overall stable in size. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The ET tube terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina. There is a right IJ which terminates in the low SVC. There is an enteric tube, which extends below the diaphragm and terminates within the body of the stomach. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
