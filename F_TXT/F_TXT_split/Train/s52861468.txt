A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC. A 2.8 cm rectangular opacity overlying the eighth rib posteriorly on the right adjacent to an EKG lead is external to the patient. Bibasilar opacities are improved compared to prior study of ___. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely reflects a small pleural effusion, unchanged from prior. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size and the cardiomediastinal silhouette are unremarkable.
