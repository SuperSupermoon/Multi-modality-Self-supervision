Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn to standard placement at the thoracic inlet. Lung volumes remain very low, accounting in part for mediastinal widening at the level of the aortic arch, but there is also progressive mediastinal vascular engorgement suggesting volume overload. Caliber of the mediastinum would need to be monitored following neck surgery. No appreciable pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.
