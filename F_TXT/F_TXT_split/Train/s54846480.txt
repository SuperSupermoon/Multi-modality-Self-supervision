Interval re-positioning of nasogastric tube, with tip now in the proximal stomach and side port probably above the GE junction level.

Widespread bilateral pulmonary opacities have slightly improved, and bilateral pleural effusions appear slightly decreased in the interval. Positional differences may contribute to the apparent change in pleural effusion.
