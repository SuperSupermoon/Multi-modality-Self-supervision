Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina. Feeding tube passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. Left PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Cardiomegaly is present. There is mild pulmonary edema, but infectious process in particular in the left lower lobe and potentially in the left upper and lower lobe cannot be excluded given the interval development of this parenchymal opacities. Again, they might be attributable to vascular engorgement given the distended azygos vein and volume overload but infectious process is a possibility and re-assessment after diuresis is recommended.
