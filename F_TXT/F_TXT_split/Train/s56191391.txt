In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes. There is mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with left ventricular configuration. Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis persist. Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm suggests substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. Pulmonary vessels are somewhat ill-defined, suggesting some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
