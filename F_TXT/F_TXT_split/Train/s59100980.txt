AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest images: Heart is mildly enlarged and mediastinal vessels are engorged suggesting volume overload. Right lung is clear. The lower portion of the left lung is somewhat heterogeneous and there may be atelectasis or early consolidation. Conventional radiographs recommended for followup when feasible. No appreciable pleural effusion, no evidence of pneumothorax.
