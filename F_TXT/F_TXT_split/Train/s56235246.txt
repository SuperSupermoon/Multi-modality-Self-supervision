The patient is rotated and dextroconvex scoliosis is severe, distorting the chest cage. The newly placed right subclavian approach central venous catheter tip projects over the expected region of the low SVC. The newly placed right chest tube tip projects over the mid right hemi thorax, but the side port projects over the ribs and is not clearly within the thoracic cavity. The ETT is in standard position. The enteric tube traverses the midline into the left upper quadrant and its tip is beyond the scope of this image. Subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest wall is extensive. Numerous displaced bilateral rib fractures are unchanged. The known right pneumothorax now appears smaller after chest tube placement with persistent small apical lateral pneumothorax. Opacification of the left lower hemithorax with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm, left heart border, aortic contours most likely is secondary to a moderate left pleural effusion and atelectasis; however, contusions cannot be excluded. Heart size is not well evaluated but probably the cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Aortic knob calcifications are unchanged. A right pleural effusion is small. Opacities near the periphery of the right lung and rib fractures could be contusions.
