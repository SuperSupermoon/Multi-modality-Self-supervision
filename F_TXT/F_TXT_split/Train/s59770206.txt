The cardiac silhouette is again severely enlarged with globular appearance that may suggest some degree of pericardial effusion. Extent of the heart size is difficult to evaluate in the presence of large bilateral pleural effusions which are similar in severity compared to prior exam, with adjacent bibasilar compressive atelectasis. There is increased central pulmonary vascular congestion with increased reticulations compatible with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Calcified right lung nodules indicate prior granulomatous disease. There is no pneumothorax.
