Chronic interstitial reticular opacities are similar to multiple prior studies with new superimposed airspace opacities likely representing pneumonia in bilateral lung bases, particularly in the retrocardiac area. There is likely a left pleural effusion as well. There is no pneumothorax or definite pulmonary edema or right pleural effusion. A left pectoral pacemaker projects in unchanged location with interval addition of a second coronary sinus lead. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unchanged, partially silhouetted by diffuse parenchymal abnormalities.
