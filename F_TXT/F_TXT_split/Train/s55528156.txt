Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears mildly enlarged with sharp margins, likely in part due to low lung volumes. If high concern for mediastinal injury, CT would be recommended. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen. No displaced fracture seen.
