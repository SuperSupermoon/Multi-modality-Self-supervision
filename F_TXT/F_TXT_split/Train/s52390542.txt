Compared to the chest x-ray from ___, there has been partial interval clearing of the retrocardiac opacity. Faint patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is no longer visible. There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. There is a new right subclavian PICC line. The tip is not well visualized. A cannot be traced beyond the expected site of confluence of the subclavian and innominate veins, in the region of the proximal most SVC. No pneumothorax detected.
