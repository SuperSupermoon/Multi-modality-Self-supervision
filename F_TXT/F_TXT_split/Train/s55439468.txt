As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Normal structure and transparency of the lung parenchyma. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema, no pleural effusion. A dense rounded structure in the right lung apex, projecting over the ventral part of the first right rib likely reflects that degenerative change in the sternocostal junction.
