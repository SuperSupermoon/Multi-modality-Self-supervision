In comparison with the study of ___, the left IJ catheter has been removed. The endotracheal tube and enteric tube are stable. Continued opacification at the left base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm. This suggests layering pleural fluid with some volume loss in the left lower lobe. The opacification at the right base is decreasing and the hemidiaphragm is sharply seen on this side. No evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
