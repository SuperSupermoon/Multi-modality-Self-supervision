1. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable cardiac enlargement. Given differences in technique, there is likely no significant interval change. There continues to be mild interstitial prominence which may reflect residual mild interstitial edema. There is also layering left effusion with patchy opacity at the left base likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
