As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is after right segmentectomy. A 1-cm pneumothorax is visualized at the right lung apex. There is no evidence of tension. A right chest tube is in expected position. Mild postoperative atelectasis at the right lung base. Moderate cardiomegaly, minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, likely caused by a small basal atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the aorta. No overt pulmonary edema.
