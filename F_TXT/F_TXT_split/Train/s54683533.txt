There is an ET tube but slightly low, 1.4 cm above the carina. Feeding tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach. Right-sided PICC line tip is just below the cavoatrial junction. There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions layering posteriorly. There has been some interval improvement in aeration of the right lower lung but there continues to be hazy alveolar infiltrate left greater than right compatible pulmonary edema. An underlying infectious infiltrate can't be totally excluded
