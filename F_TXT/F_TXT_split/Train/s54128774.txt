Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Right pigtail pleural catheter has been slightly withdrawn, with the proximal-most side hole now outside the pleural cavity. Right internal jugular catheter terminates in the lower SVC. Metallic aortic valve appears in similar position to prior. Right atrial and right ventricular leads of a left chest wall generator are in stable position. Right pleural effusion has decreased, now small. Small left pleural pleural effusion remains. Right medial lung base and retrocardiac opacities have improved. Small right apical pneumothorax persists. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
