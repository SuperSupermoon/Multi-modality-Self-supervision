Compared with the prior study,extensive left-sided subcutaneous emphysema about the left chest and about the lower neck is again seen. Also again seen are the left-sided chest tube and left pigtail catheter. Though these appear unchanged in configuration, note is made that the curved portion of pigtail is centered on the chest wall and the proximal sideport of the left chest tube may lie outside the chest wall. Clinical correlation is requested. On the current film, there is a small left apical pneumothorax. There is also probably some pneumothorax air deep to the medial side of the left lung. Lucency along the left border of the heart is more apparent. The right lung is similar on the prior film, with a small right apical pneumothorax and band like opacity along the minor fissure, suggesting a small amount of fluid in the minor fissure. No other right-sided pneumothorax is detected, though a subtle occult pneumothorax might not be apparent. Mild represent a redistribution is unchanged. Aside from minimal atelectasis at the left lung base, there is no focal opacity no focal parenchymal opacity. No gross effusion.
