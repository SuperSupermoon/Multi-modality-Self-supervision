The lateral portion of the mid and lower left chest is excluded from the film. An enteric type tube is present, extending beneath the diaphragm, with radiopaque tip overlying the stomach. A right subclavian central line is present, tip obscured by overlying EKG leads I suspect, but cannot confirm, that is similar to the prior film, overlying the upper right atrium. Again seen is cardiomegaly with mild vascular plethora. The right lung shows no focal infiltrate or gross effusion. The left upper lung is grossly clear. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted.
