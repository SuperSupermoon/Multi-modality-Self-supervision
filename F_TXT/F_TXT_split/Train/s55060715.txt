Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There has been retraction of the left IJ central line with distal lead tip now in distal SVC, appropriately sited. There is a right IJ central line with the distal lead tip at the distal SVC. Endotracheal tube tip is 5.7 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. There is a feeding tube; distal tip is in the fundus of the stomach. There is prominent amount of air seen within the stomach. The heart size is within normal limits. There is some atelectasis versus early consolidation at the lung bases, stable. No pneumothoraces are present.
