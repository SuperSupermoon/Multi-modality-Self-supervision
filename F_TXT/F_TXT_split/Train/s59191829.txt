Diffuse heterogeneous opacities are again demonstrated throughout the right lung, with interval improved aeration in the right mid and lower lung.

Mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has slightly improved, but a small left pleural effusion has increased.
