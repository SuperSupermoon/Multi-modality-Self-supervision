AP chest compared to large right pleural effusion is new or substantially increased since ___. Moderately severe interstitial abnormality seen more clearly in the left lung has worsened. Overall findings are most consistent with pulmonary edema and heart failure, although heart size is normal and unchanged. Cardiac configuration suggests an abnormal left ventricle. The large right pleural effusion could hide infection in the right lung, but there is no reason to invoke that to explain the findings. ET tube is in standard placement, left subclavian infusion port ends 6 cm below the level of the carina and would need to be withdrawn 2.5 cm to securely localize it in the low SVC. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged at 9:10 a.m., 1 minute following recognition of the findings.
