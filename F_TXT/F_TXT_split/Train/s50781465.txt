Again seen is a right sided dialysis catheter with distal tip overlying the right atrium. An enteric tube is again seen coursing inferiorly, with distal tip projecting over the approximate location of the ligament of Treitz. Multiple median sternotomy wires are again identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable. Aortic arch calcifications are again noted. The bilateral hila are within normal limits. The lungs are clear. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Subtle opacity overlying the right lower lung likely reflects layering right pleural effusion, better assessed on same-day CT scan. There is no pneumothorax or radiographic evidence of left pleural effusion.
