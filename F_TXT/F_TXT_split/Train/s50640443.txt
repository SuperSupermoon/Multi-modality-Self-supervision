A nasogastric tube coils in the fundus of the stomach with the tip terminating in the gastric body. Mildly dilated small bowel loops are partially imaged in this study. A circumscribed 3.0 cm right upper lobe opacity with a pleural tag, is concerning for a malignancy. Again seen are multifocal pulmonary opacities in the left mid lung and possibly the lung bases, reflective of multifocal infection.
