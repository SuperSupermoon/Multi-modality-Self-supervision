In comparison with the study of ___, there has been some improvement in aeration of the right hemithorax with the mediastinum now midline. Nevertheless, there remains extensive opacification in the right hemithorax consistent with atelectasis and effusion. There may be some element of asymmetric pulmonary edema as well. On the left, opacification at the base is consistent with some combination of effusion and atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical scenario, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. Tracheostomy tube remains in place, and there is again evidence of cervical fusion.
