Comparison is made to the prior study, CT and x-ray, from a day earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with widened mediastinum due to increase in mediastinal fat and lymphadenopathy, better seen on prior CT. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the upper svc. There is no pneumothorax. Minimal bilateral effusions, left greater than right, consistent with adjacent atelectasis are stable. Interstitial edema has worsened.
