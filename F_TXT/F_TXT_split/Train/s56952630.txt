As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressure is. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities, notably at the right lung base, continue to be visible but are less severe and extensive than on the previous image. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged normal position.
