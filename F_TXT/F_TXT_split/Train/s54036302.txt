The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta demonstrates vascular calcifications and mild unfolding. Diffuse interstitial opacities with reticulation are noted, most pronounced at the lung bases, suggestive of an underlying chronic interstitial lung disease with probable fibrosis. Additionally, there appears to be mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. No pneumothorax is definitively noted nor is there pleural effusion. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
