Tip of the new endotracheal tube is less than 2 cm from the carina with the chin in neutral position. Care should be taken that it not advance any further, or it can be withdrawn up to 15 mm. Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, which has been present in the left lung for several days worsened appreciably earlier in the day and a smaller region of consolidation at the right lung base which had developed between ___ and ___ worsened considerably in out lung over the course of the day. With Intubation lung volumes have improved slightly and positive pressure probably accounts for mild improvement in the right lung. There is no pneumothorax. No small to moderate left pleural effusion is likely. Heart remains enlarged and the mediastinal veins are particularly distended suggesting elevated right heart pressure. Differential diagnosis as discussed previously includes progressive severe pneumonia, concurrent pulmonary hemorrhage, and now, with involvement of the right lung, noncardiogenic edema.
