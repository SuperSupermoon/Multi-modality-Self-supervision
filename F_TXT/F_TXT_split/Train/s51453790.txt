A left-sided pigtail catheter is unchanged in position compared to the prior study. A right-sided internal jugular Port-A-Cath terminates in the distal SVC or right atrium. There is a small amount of subcutaneous air in the left chest wall. No pneumothorax seen. The the previously demonstrated left apical pneumothorax is not clearly seen. Small right pleural effusion. Increased opacity at the right lung base likely reflects a atelectasis.
