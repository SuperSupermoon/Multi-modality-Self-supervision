As compared to the previous radiograph, the left lung shows unchanged evidence of a small pneumothorax. A pre-existing pneumothorax on the right has decreased in extent, its lateral aspect is no longer visible, only its apical aspect is seen. The monitoring and support devices, including the bilateral chest tubes are constant. Constant size of the cardiac silhouette. Constant appearance of the lung parenchyma, with, however, minimal increase in atelectasis at the right lung bases.
