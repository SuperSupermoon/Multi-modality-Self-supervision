Right subclavian PICC line, tracheostomy tube, and chest tube remain in position. The left apicolateral pneumothorax does not appear to be significantly changed. Slightly improved aeration in the lungs with residual blunting of the left costophrenic angle and patchy lower lobe opacity likely representing combination of compressive atelectasis and pleural effusion. There has been interval appearance of mild vascular congestion as well as progression of patchy opacity at the right medial lung base which also likely reflects patchy atelectasis. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
