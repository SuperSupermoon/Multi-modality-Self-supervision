As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Low lung volumes with bilateral pleural effusions and rather extensive parenchymal opacities. The patient is more rotated than on the previous image, but the pre-existing left lung opacity appears to have minimally decreased in severity and extent. Unchanged overall appearance of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
