Sternal wires and an upper mediastinal drain are new from recent tracheal surgery. Mediastinum has a normal postoperative caliber. Left bronchial stent unchanged in position. There is new atelectasis in the left lung, reflected in leftward mediastinal shift and greater opacification of the left upper lobe. A small amount of pneumomediastinum is present. Whether there is medial pneumothorax is radiographically indeterminate. Radiographic followup advised. Right lung is clear.
