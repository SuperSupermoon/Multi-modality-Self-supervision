Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Two apical and one basal right chest tubes are new. Pleural effusion has almost completely resolved. There is reexpansion of right middle lobe and right lower lobe. There is reexpansion pulmonary edema in the right lung. ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is high likely in the mid-to-lower esophagus, should be advanced in standard position. New diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities elsewhere in the lungs are likely mild edema.
