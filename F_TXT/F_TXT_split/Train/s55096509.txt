As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged extent and severity of the known left basal pneumonia, likely combined with a small left pleural effusion. On the right, at the lung base, there is a newly appeared very subtle parenchymal opacity that needs to be followed to exclude another infectious focus or the presence of aspiration pneumonia. No pneumothorax. No other lung parenchymal change. The monitoring and support devices, including the nasogastric tube and the endotracheal tube are in constant position.
