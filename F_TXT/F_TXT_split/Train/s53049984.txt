AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. No pneumothorax has developed. Right internal jugular approach central venous line remains in unchanged position. The on previous examination identified left lower lobe atelectasis has further increased and represents now a total obliteration of the diaphragmatic contour on the left side, including evidence of spontaneous air bronchogram in the corresponding central airways. Thus there is now evidence of a large size left lower lobe atelectasis. The pulmonary vasculature has not changed, and no pneumothorax has developed.
