AP chest compared to ___: Chronic moderate cardiomegaly, accompanied by hilar vascular engorgement, is chronic. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumonia or any appreciable pleural effusion. The trachea is deviated by tortuous vessel to the head and neck and an enlarged right thyroid lobe. No pneumothorax. I do not see any radiopaque cardiopulmonary support devices on this study. There may be a small to moderate hiatus hernia.
