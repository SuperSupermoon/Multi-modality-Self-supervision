Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. With this factor in mind, cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and unchanged. Lungs are clear except for a questionable area of increased opacity in the left retrocardiac region, partially obscuring the medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm. Given concern for a possible pneumonia, dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful to more fully evaluate this region when the patient's condition allows.
