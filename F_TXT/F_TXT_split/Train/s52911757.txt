There is pulmonary vascular redistribution and patchy alveolar infiltrates in both lower lungs. There is a moderate left effusion that is increased compared to prior. There is dense retrocardiac consolidation. It is unclear if all of the findings are due to fluid overload or if there is a superimposed infectious infiltrate. Left subclavian line with tip in the SVC is unchanged
