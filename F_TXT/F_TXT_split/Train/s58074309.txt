The Dobbhoff tube is noted with top of the weighted tip at the gastroesophageal junction, and should be advanced into the stomach. Right IJ catheter tip projects over the expected region of the upper SVC. A right chest tube is in unchanged position. ET tube is noted with tip approximately 5.8 cm above the carina. Again noted is subcutaneous emphysema along the right hemithorax. Right perihilar opacification appears stable since the most recent prior examination. Increasing opacification in the left lung may represent pleural effusion versus multifocal pneumonia on a background of pulmonary edema.
