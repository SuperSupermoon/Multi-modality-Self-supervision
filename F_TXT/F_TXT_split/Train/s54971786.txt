The endotracheal tube has been repositioned, now appropriately terminating in the upper thoracic trachea, below the thoracic inlet, approximately 6.5 cm above the carina. There has been progressive opacification of the left upper lobe since the prior study suggesting atelectasis/ mucous plugging. Otherwise, the appearance of the chest is unchanged.
