An endovascular aortic valve repair is noted in addition to a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device. The heart is again enlarged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar. In addition to small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, which are probably unchanged, there is increased prominence of pulmonary vasculature. This suggests mild but worsening pulmonary edema. Multiple vertebroplasty sites are again noted.
