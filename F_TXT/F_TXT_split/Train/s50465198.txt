Following exchanged of pleural catheter in the left hemi thorax, a left pleural effusion has substantially decreased in size and a moderate pneumothorax has developed. Rounded opacity adjacent to the left heart border could reflect round atelectasis or potentially a neoplastic mass in this patient who presented with a large pleural effusion. Chest CT may be helpful for further evaluation of this finding, as well as to better assess the aorticpulmonary window for possible lymph node enlargement.
