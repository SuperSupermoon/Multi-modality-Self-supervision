Tracheostomy tube is again seen. Left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is present, with the tip in the junction of the brachiocephalic veins. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain unchanged, allowing for the technique. A balloon is seen projecting over the stomach, probably representing a gastrostomy tube. There is increased opacification of the right hemithorax compared to the prior examination, with an appearance suggesting a small- to moderate-sized layering pleural effusion. The left hemithorax remains clear. No evidence of pneumothorax, although it is noted at the left lung apex is excluded from the imaging.
