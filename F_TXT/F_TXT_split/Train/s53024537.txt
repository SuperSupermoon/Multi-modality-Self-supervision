A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends 3.9 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. A right internal jugular catheter ends in the right atrium and could be pulled back approximately 5 cm to place it in the mid to distal SVC. Linear atelectasis or scarring is again seen in the right mid lung. There is no consolidative pneumonia, or pneumothorax. There is a small right pleural effusion.
