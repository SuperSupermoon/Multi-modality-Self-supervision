Portable AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates relatively low lung volumes compared to the prior study with persistent interstitial prominence and minimal pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Hazy opacity in the right lung base likely represents atelectasis, however underlying infection cannot be completely excluded. The cardiac silhouette is stable.
