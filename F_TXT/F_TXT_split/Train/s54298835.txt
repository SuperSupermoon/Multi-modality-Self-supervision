In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has taken a slightly better inspiration. The right subclavian catheter extends to the cavoatrial junction or upper portion of the right atrium. Nasogastric tube extends to the second portion of the duodenum. Opacification at the left base is again consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Less prominent atelectatic changes are seen at the right base. The pulmonary vascularity is probably within normal limits given the low lung volumes, which accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart.
