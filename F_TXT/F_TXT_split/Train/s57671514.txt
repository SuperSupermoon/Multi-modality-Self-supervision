A portable AP radiograph of the chest depicts a new orogastric tube coursing through the esophagus and terminating within the stomach. The endotracheal tube is unchanged in position, no less than 3.8 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular introduction sheath terminates in the upper SVC. There is persistent mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal widening. The left retrocardiac opacity has not markedly changed from the most recent study approximately six hours ago. Atelectasis at the right base has improved somewhat. The lungs are otherwise clear, and the pulmonary vascularity is normal, without edema. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
