An upper enteric tube is in place, terminating in the proximal stomach. Endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina. A right-sided subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the high right atrium. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. The left hilar contour is not well evaluated. There is nodular contour and infrahilar expansion of the right hilar contour as well as numerous bilateral scattered nodular opacities measuring up to 3.5 cm at the right lung base. There is loss of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour with leftward mediastinal shift suggestive of volume loss.
