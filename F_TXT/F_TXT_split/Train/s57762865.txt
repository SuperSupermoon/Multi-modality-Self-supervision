AP chest presented for review at 6 p.m. on ___: Sharply marginated nearly round 9 x 10 cm high attenuation structure in the midline is probably an external artifact, such as a suction devise, but I would need orthogonal views to confirm that, as well as appropriate clinical correlation. Left lower lobe consolidation, and mild leftward mediastinal shift, unchanged since ___, are presumably atelectasis, accompanied by increased small left pleural effusion. There is no mediastinal widening. Postoperative mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Right pleural and upper mediastinal drains are noted. No pneumothorax or right pleural effusion is present. Right subclavian line ends low in the SVC.
