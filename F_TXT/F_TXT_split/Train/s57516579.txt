AP chest compared to ___: New nasogastric tube ends in the distal stomach. Mild pulmonary edema was present on ___, evenly distributed. On today's examination, there is substantially greater opacification in the right lower lung. This could be asymmetric edema particularly if patient has been in the right decubitus position for a long time. Otherwise, this could be pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. I doubt this is edema because heart size is smaller today than it has been previously, and there is no mediastinal or pulmonary vascular engorgement. No pneumothorax.
