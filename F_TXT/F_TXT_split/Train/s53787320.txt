Near complete opacification of the left hemothorax has developed since the radiograph 1.5 hr prior with increased leftward shift of the mediastinal structures, consistent with lung collapse. At least a small to moderate sized left pleural effusion is present. An intrabronchial mass is seen in the distal left mainstem bronchus with a fiducial marker. The right lung appears clear. No pneumothorax is identified in either lung.
