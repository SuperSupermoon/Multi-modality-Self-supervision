AP chest compared to ___: Opacification at the base of the right hemithorax has been present since ___, 6:05 p.m., whereas on a torso CT performed earlier that day, there was no corresponding abnormality. The rapid development of that change is a good indication of right lower lobe collapse, that was present without much change through 6:30 a.m. on ___. It has improved minimally and now one can see a small right pleural effusion. The left lower lobe, however, has been relatively normal, but today has developed severe consolidation which was minimal on ___. This is either pneumonia or left lower lobe collapse. Small left pleural effusion is present, but not clinically significant. There is no pulmonary edema or even much vascular congestion in the upper lobes. Heart has been mildly enlarged throughout. Tip of the endotracheal tube is partially obscured by spinal hardware, but appears to be at the thoracic inlet. Left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC, and an upper enteric drainage tube ends in non-distended stomach. There is no pneumothorax. Large lung volumes, despite patient's debility suggests COPD.
