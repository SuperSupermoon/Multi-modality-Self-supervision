In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been pushed forward so that the tip lies approximately 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube and left central catheter are essentially unchanged. Bilateral areas of opacification at the bases most likely reflect atelectasis. Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm persists, raising the possibility of some pleural effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. A lateral view would be helpful if the condition of the patient permits.
