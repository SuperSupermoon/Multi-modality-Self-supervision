There is a large left pleural effusion which appears slightly increased as compared to the prior study, with underlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude. There is also moderate to severe pulmonary edema. More confluent right base opacity may relate to pulmonary edema, however underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude. The cardiac silhouette is grossly stable although not accurately assessed due to the bibasilar opacities. Aortic knob is calcified.
