As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new pigtail catheter on the right. The fluid collection at the medial right lung base has decreased in extent. The right hemithorax shows no evidence of pleural air inclusion. The lung volumes have overall decreased. This might account for a diffuse increase in radiodensity of the left lung parenchyma, with slightly enlarged diameters of the vascular structures. However, short-term radiographic followup must be performed to exclude the presence of early pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
