Right PIC line has been advanced since earlier in the day. The tip is now at a level approximately 8 cm below the carina and would need to be withdrawn 3.5 cm to reposition it close to the superior cavoatrial junction. Large right pleural loculations are essentially unchanged, despite 3 right pigtail pleural drainage catheters. The apical component of pleural effusion is probably loculated and isolated from either pleural tube. Mild interstitial edema may be developing the base of the left lung. Base the right lung is consolidated or atelectatic, as before. Heart size normal.
