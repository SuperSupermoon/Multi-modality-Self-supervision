There is a patchy opacity in the right lower lung, but dramatically decreased since the prior radiographs and perhaps a residual area of minor scarring associated with earlier infection. Streaky opacities at the left base are minor and probably due to minor atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Mild-to-moderate rightward convex curvature is centered along the lower thoracic spine.
