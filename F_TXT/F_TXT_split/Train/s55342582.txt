Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. There has been interval decrease in previously seen right lung patchy opacities with smaller residual opacity persisting in the right mid-to-lower lung zone. The left lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace right pleural effusion may be difficult to exclude.
