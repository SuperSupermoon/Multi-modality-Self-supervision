Chest, single AP view, portable which excludes a large portion of the left hemidiaphragm. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison. An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 5.1 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present -- the tip extends to the inferior edge of the film, though this plane lies above the GE junction. Probable background hyperinflation/COPD. Moderate cardiomegaly, with a calcified aorta. Upper zone redistribution and probable mild vascular plethora, but no overt CHF. Bibasilar patchy opacities are not fully evaluated on this view. Minimal linear atelectasis or scarring noted in both mid zones. No gross effusion, though small effusions would be excluded from the film.
