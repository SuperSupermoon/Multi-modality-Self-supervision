AP chest compared to ___, 11:26 a.m.: ET tube has been advanced, now in standard placement. Right pleural tube has also been advanced so that now all the side ports project within the hemithorax. Left internal jugular catheter ends at the thoracic inlet. Right jugular line ends in the mid-to-low SVC. Nasogastric drainage tube is coiled in the stomach. Interstitial pulmonary edema continues to clear, now revealing a somewhat nodular character to the most severe consolidative abnormality, in the right lower lobe as well as nodules in the left lung. Overall, findings suggest extensive right lower lobe pneumonia and possible sepsis. Heart size is normal and, as before, mediastinal veins do not suggest elevated central venous pressure or volume. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion minimal, if any.
