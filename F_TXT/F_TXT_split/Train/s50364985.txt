Limited evaluation due to underlying trauma board. An endotracheal tube terminates 3.1 cm above the carina, likely due to patient's position. Orogastric tube is seen coiling within the esophagus with secondary massive distention of the stomach. The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged. Bilateral diffuse opacities are most compatible with severe pneumonia as seen on subsequent chest CTA.
