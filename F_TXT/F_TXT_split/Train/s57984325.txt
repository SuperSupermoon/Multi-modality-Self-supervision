Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. A left chest wall AICD is noted with lead tips extending into the region of the right atrium and right ventricle. The heart remains moderately enlarged. There is a coronary stent projecting over the right heart border. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. Increased lower lung ground-glass opacities could represent pneumonia, less likely pulmonary edema given the distribution. Mediastinal contour is normal. Midline sternotomy clips and mediastinal clips are again noted. A left shoulder replacement is noted. Bony structures appear intact.
