Heart is upper limits of normal in size. Interval decrease in distention of the neoesophagus. Previously present diffuse bilateral airspace opacities have partially improved in the interval, with residual opacities involving the right lung more than the left, and demonstrating a relative upper lung predominance, particularly in the left hemithorax. Bilateral interstitial opacities, presumably representing interstitial edema have also decreased in extent, and a right pleural effusion has decreased in size with residual small-to-moderate effusion remaining. Probable persistent small left pleural effusion, but no visible pneumothorax.
