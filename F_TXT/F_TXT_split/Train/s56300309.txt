Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. Left costophrenic angle and hemidiaphragm is obscured, suggestive of moderate pleural effusion and an adjacent area of consolidation. Right cardiac border and right hemidiaphragm is preserved. There is no large right pleural effusion. Right lung base opacity is present. Mediastinum appears widened. Cardiac border is difficult to discern due to surrounding opacities. Pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. Imaged osseous structures appear intact.
