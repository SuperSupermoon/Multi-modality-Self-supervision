There is a tiny left apical pneumothorax. There is a right IJ central line with the distal lead tip in the distal right atrium. This could be pulled back 4-5 cm for more optimal placement. Other support lines and tubes have been removed. Heart size is enlarged but stable. There has been improvement of the pulmonary interstitial edema. There remains a small left retrocardiac opacity.
