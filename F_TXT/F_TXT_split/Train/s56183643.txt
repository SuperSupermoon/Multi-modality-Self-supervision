Right-sided PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes are markedly low, which accentuates bronchovascular markings. There is mild thickening of the horizontal fissure on the right which may represent a small amount of fluid in the fissure. Bilateral opacities, left greater than right could represent some mild edema and atelectasis. No large focal consolidation or pleural effusion is seen. The aorta is tortuous and the heart is stable in size.
