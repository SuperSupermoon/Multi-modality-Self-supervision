Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates the ET tube ending 7.4 cm above the carina, which is retracted by approximately 2 cm from the prior study. The OG tube passes below the diaphragm with the side hole within the stomach. The tip is not visualized on this study. Otherwise no change in heart size with no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Bilateral rib fractures better demonstrated on previous CT. Thickening of the right apical pleural line "apical cap" is unchanged from prior study, consistent with pleural effusion, likely hemothorax from rib fracture.
