A single portable frontal upright view of the chest was obtained. Heart is normal in size and cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable. Calcifications are noted along the aortic arch and descending aorta. Lungs are clear. Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus likely suggests a small effusion. A G-tube is noted within the stomach. There is no pneumothorax.
