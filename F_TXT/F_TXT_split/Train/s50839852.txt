As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The parenchymal opacities on the right are of unchanged extent and severity. On the left, the transparency of the lung parenchyma has minimally increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressure. The endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. Unchanged size and shape of the cardiac silhouette.
