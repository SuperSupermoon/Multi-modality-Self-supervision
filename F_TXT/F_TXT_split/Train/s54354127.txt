Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. There is background COPD. There are bilateral calcified pleural plaques, weight can obscure underlying pulmonary parenchyma. There is mild cardiomegaly, with a calcified unfolded aorta, likely unchanged, allowing for technical differences. Prominence of the hila, with a tapered appearance, is suggestive of pulmonary hypertension, unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. There is new patchy opacity at the left base. Minimal opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is not clearly changed. No gross effusion is identified.
