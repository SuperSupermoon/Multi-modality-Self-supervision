No previous images. There is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, which may be due to relatively low lung volumes. There is asymmetric prominence of pulmonary vascularity, more prominent on the right, consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema. In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. Of incidental note is an old fracture of the mid portion of the right clavicle.
