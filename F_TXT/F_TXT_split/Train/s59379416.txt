New since prior exam is a left IJ central venous catheter with distal tip projecting over the low SVC in grossly appropriate location. There is no pneumothorax. The enteric tube and the ET tube are in unchanged, appropriate configuration. There is a stable appearance of the heart and lungs, including at least moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and diffuse bilateral airspace opacities. Difficult to exclude trace pleural effusions.
