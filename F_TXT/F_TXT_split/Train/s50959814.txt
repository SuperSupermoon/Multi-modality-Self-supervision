Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The left lower lobe opacity is seen, worrisome for pneumonia. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle and there may be an associated pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax.
