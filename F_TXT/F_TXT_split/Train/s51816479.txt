Dual-lead left-sided pacer in place with the leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. The heart remains enlarged with the left ventricular prominence, suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy. The aorta remains somewhat tortuous. Streaky layering opacities in both upper lungs as well as at the right base are stable, most likely reflecting post-inflammatory scarring or parenchymal changes related to underlying emphysema. In either case, there does not appear to be superimposed pulmonary edema or a definite acute infectious process. Followup imaging should be considered if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusions.
