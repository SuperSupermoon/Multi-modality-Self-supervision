Greater opacification in the in the right hemi thorax is probably a combination of increasing moderate right pleural effusion and pulmonary edema. Each component makes the other look worse. Left lung is still largely collapsed, with aeration at one 8 the apex. Any left pleural effusion is probably secondary to pulmonary pathology. Heart is large, but still markedly shifted to the left because of the collapse. ET tube and right subclavian line are in standard placements and a transesophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Left basal pleural drainage catheter still in place. No pneumothorax.
