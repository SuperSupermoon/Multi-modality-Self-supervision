In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure is seen. The medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe similar to the previous study. The left costophrenic angle remains clear. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
