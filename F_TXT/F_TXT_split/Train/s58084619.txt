The Dobbhoff tube has been partially removed and its tip is just below the gastroesophageal junction. Surgical ___ from exploratory laparotomy are redemonstrated. Otherwise, lung volumes are low. Linear opacities across the left lower lobe represent segmental atelectasis. There is also some retrocardiac atelectasis obscuring the margin of the left hemidiaphragm. No other focal opacities are present. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Although assessment of abdominal free air cannot be performed due to poor position, no secondary signs of free air are identified.
