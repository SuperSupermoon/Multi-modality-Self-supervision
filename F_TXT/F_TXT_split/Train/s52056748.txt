Tip of the endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. OGT is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, the distal end is beyond the field of view. Internal jugular line ends at right mid atrium. Bilateral, veil-like opacities, right side more than left, reflecting moderate right and mild left pleural effusions are unchanged since ___. AN ill-defined and more discrete opacity in the right mid lung corresponds to the opacity in the lateral segment of the right middle lobe, demomsrated on chest CT from ___, is most likely atelectasis. However, requires attention on followup radiograph to rule out an evolving pneumonia. Presumed small left Pleural effusion and increased retrocardiac opacity suggesting left lower lung atelectasis is similar. Moderate-to-large heart and hilar contours are unchanged in appearance.
