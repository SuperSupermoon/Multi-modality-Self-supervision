As compared to the previous image, the patient has received an upper tracheal stent. The stent appears to be in correct position. The post-surgical changes in the mediastinum and at the right hilus are constant. The previously placed endotracheal tube is now removed. No evidence of postoperative parenchymal changes, in particular no pneumothorax and no evidence of aspiration. Unchanged appearance of the left hemithorax and the heart.
