Stable postoperative appearance to the cardiac and mediastinal contours in this patient status post descending aortic repair.

Retrocardiac consolidation likely reflects compressive atelectasis in the setting of a small layering effusion, although pneumonia in this area cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax.
