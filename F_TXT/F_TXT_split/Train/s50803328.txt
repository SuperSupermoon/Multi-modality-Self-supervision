Heart is moderately enlarged. Pulmonary edema is mild if any. Most of the abnormalities due to persistence of the pleural effusions and new left lower lobe atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Atrioventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses, continuous from the left pectoral generator. No pneumothorax. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT scanning. There is a healed fracture deformity of the proximal right humerus with severe degenerative changes at the shoulder.
