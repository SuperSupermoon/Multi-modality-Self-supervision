Evaluation of the chest is limited due to portable technique and rotation of the patient. Within this limitation, there is a left pectoral Port-A-Cath with the tip terminating in the proximal right atrium. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size. The aortic contours are prominent likely due to patient rotation. Increased pulmonary interstitial markings suggest minimal pulmonary vascular congestion. Trace pleural fluid is seen. There is no focal consolidation. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
