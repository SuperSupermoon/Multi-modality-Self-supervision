Lung volumes are lower, and atelectasis is moderate to severe in the left lower lobe, mild on the right. Pleural effusion is small on the left if any. No pneumothorax. Interval increase in cardiac diameter, still normal, probably reflects intravascular volume increase and supine positioning. There is no pulmonary edema although upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is well filled. Subcutaneous emphysema is extending superiorly along the left chest wall past skin ___. Clinical inspection is advised. ET tube and trans esophageal drainage tube are in standard placements.
