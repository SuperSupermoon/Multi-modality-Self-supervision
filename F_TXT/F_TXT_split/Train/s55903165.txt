Small left pleural effusion and and possible trace right pleural effusion present. There is mild pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities may relate to pleural effusions and vascular congestion, however, underlying aspiration or infection are not excluded, as also noted on the prior study. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with the cardiac silhouette enlarged in the aorta calcified and tortuous.
