The heart size is moderately enlarged. There is dense retrocardiac opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. There is increased left effusion that is layering posteriorly. There is hazy bilateral vasculature compatible with fluid overload. There is a small right effusion. There is right lower lobe volume loss. Patchy areas of alveolar infiltrate are also present bilaterally. The ET tube, right-sided PICC line, and NG tube are unchanged.
