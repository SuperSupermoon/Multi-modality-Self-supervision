In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes with prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. There is indistinctness of mildly engorged pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with atelectatic change in probable small pleural effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Of incidental note is dilated gas-filled structure in the left upper quadrant, which appears to represent the splenic flexure of the colon.
