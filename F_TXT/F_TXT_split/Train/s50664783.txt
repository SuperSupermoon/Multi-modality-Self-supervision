1. Endotracheal tube now lies with its tip 3.2 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right basilar pigtail catheter remains in position. Lung volumes remain low. Overall, there is crowding of the pulmonary vascularity, but the vasculature is more prominent and therefore there is likely an element of superimposed perihilar edema. No pneumothorax is seen. Persistent but smaller right pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning.
