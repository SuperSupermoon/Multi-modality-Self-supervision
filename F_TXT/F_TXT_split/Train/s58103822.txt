An endotracheal tube terminates in the thoracic inlet, 11 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, the tip is seen in the gastric fundus. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Linear bibasilar densities likely reflect atelectasis or aspration. There is no pneumothorax or pnemomediastinum.
