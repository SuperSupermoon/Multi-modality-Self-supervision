AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination obtained four hours earlier during the same day. The patient has now been intubated, an ETT is seen to terminate in the trachea 5 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. Also noted is the placement of a NG tube that passes below the diaphragm including its side port. No new pulmonary changes can be identified in comparison with the previous study.
