Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent small left-sided apical pneumothorax, which is not significantly changed from the prior study. Again seen is mild left-sided atelectasis, also unchanged. A chest tube projects over the left hemithorax. The right lung is clear. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. A left-sided PICC ends at the cavoatrial junction.
