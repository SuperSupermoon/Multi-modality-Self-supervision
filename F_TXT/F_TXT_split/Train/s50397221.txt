An endotracheal tube has been placed with the tip terminating in the lower trachea. A nasogastric tube is also in position with the tip extending below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the gastric bubble in the left upper abdomen. There is an unrecognized helical metallic device projecting over the descending thoracic aorta. The patient is status post aortic valve replacement. Multiple mediastinal and right lateral hemithorax surgical clips are unchanged in appearance from the prior study. The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased compared to ___. There is no significant change in the dilatation at the aorta. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. The heart is top normal in size, which is accentuated by the patient's low lung volumes. Within these limitations, the lungs appear clear with no significant focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
