The patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 4.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach but probably by only about 5 cm. A single-lead pacemaker device terminates in the right ventricle. The patient is status post sternotomy. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There are new bilateral central opacities suggesting mild pulmonary edema. Small very small pleural effusions are present. The possibility of a developing focal opacity at the right lung base is not excluded within the right lower lobe. There is also patchy retrocardiac opacification.
