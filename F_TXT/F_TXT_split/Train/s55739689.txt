No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence of vascular congestion. There is increased opacification at both bases, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobes (especially on the left) and small bilateral pleural effusions. No definite acute pneumonia, though a consolidation at the left base is difficult to exclude in the absence of a lateral view. Port-A-Cath extends to the lower SVC.
