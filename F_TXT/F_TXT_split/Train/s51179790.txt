There has been interval placement of an ET tube terminating 2.5 cm from the carina. There has also been interval placement of an enteric tube with distal tip not visualized but coursing below the diaphragm. Right PICC line is seen with tip terminating in the upper SVC. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Despite interval intubation, lung volumes are lower than on the previous chest radiograph, which account for apparent slight increase in bilateral linear opacities. There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
