AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Chronic consolidation of the left lower lobe has a large component largely if not entirely due to lobar collapse. Persistence raises questions about the integrity of the airway and possible retained secretions or continued aspiration. Associated small left pleural effusion is probably secondary to the lung process, and not of active concern for itself. Opacification at the right lung base present for several days has been due largely to posteriorly layering pleural effusion, but now new air bronchograms medially suggest developing consolidation. This could also be atelectasis or pneumonia. In the upper lungs there is no pneumonia, and no pulmonary edema. Heart is normal size and vasculature in the lungs and mediastinum normal. Left PIC line ends 6.5 cm below the level of the carina, would need to be withdrawn 2.5 cm to re-position it in the low SVC if desired. Drainage tube in the left upper abdominal quadrant is unidentifiable, presumably a gastrostomy, but cannot be localized on the single frontal view.
