NG and ET tube have been removed. Left subclavian PICC ends in lower SVC. Lung volume is still low with interval increase of right lower lobe opacification for increased consolidation and pleural effusion and highly suspicious for pneumonia. Linear atelectasis at the left lung base is stable. Diffuse increased opacity in the upper lobes is related to mild vascular congestion. Heart size is minimally enlarged since prior CXR. There is no pneumothorax.
