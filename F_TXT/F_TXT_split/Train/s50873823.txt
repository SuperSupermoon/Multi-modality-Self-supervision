Again seen is a small right apical pneumothorax, probably very slightly smaller compared with the prior film. Atelectasis and minimal pleural fluid at the left base are also again seen. The degree of atelectasis may be very slightly worse. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is the chest tube at the right lung base, with right base atelectasis medially, but no gross right pleural effusion. No left-sided pneumothorax is detected.
