AP chest compared to ___: Consolidation in the left upper lobe continues to clear, now demonstrating to better advantage the left upper lobe mass and central adenopathy in the aortopulmonic window. Minimal if any left pleural air or fluid is present. Pleural drainage tube unchanged in position. Marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is difficult to explain in the setting of positive pressure ventilation support, even if phrenic nerve palsy is present. Perhaps the stomach is overdistended, difficult to assess in the supine position. Right lung is grossly clear. ET tube in standard position. Thoracic surgery coverage paged at 9 a.m.
