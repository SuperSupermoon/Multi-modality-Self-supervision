Ap chest radiograph As compared to prior study obtained the day before, there is interval development of at least partial atelectasis of the right upper lobe. Widespread consolidations are progressing and then may be in addition interval development of mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Small left pleural effusion appears to be grossly unchanged. No definitive pneumothorax is seen after thoracocentesis.
