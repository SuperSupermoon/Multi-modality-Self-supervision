There is been interval placement of a right hemodialysis catheter in the internal jugular vein with the tip in the lower SVC. A right PICC line is in unchanged position in the low SVC. Left transvenous pacemaker with leads in the expected position of the right atrium and right ventricle is unchanged. Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right are likely related to pleural effusion and associated atelectasis and are slightly worse when compared to the prior study. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stably enlarged. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.
