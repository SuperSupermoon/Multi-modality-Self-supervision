AP chest compared to ___: There is no longer any indication of pneumothorax. Severe pulmonary opacification has worsened progressively since ___ consistent with pulmonary edema. In the setting of normal heart size this is probably noncardiogenic despite small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. As before, the cuff of the endotracheal tube is severely over-distended. Tip of the tube is no more than 18 mm from the carina and should be withdrawn 2 cm for standard positioning. Left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
