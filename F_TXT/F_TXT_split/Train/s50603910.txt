In comparison with the earlier study of this date from an outside facility, there is little change. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits in a patient with intact midline sternal wires. No definite vascular congestion or pleural effusion or acute focal pneumonia. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour and evidence of old healed rib fractures on the left. On the single frontal view, no definite tracheal abnormality is appreciated. CT would be necessary to further evaluate this region
