In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric tube has been removed. ET tube and right subclavian catheter remain in satisfactory position. Continued opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Relatively mild atelectatic changes are seen at the right base. Specifically, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.
