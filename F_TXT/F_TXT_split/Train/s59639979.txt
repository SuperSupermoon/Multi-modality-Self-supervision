Left-sided PICC is in stable position. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 7 cm above the level of the carina. A weighted enteric tube is again seen similar in position, inferior aspect not included on the image, but the weighted portion projecting in the left upper quadrant in the expected location of the proximal stomach. Left retrocardiac opacity persists, likely representing combination of left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion. There may be minimal central pulmonary vascular engorgement. No focal consolidation is seen on the right. There is no right pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
