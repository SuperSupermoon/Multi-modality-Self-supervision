CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. A right IJ central line is again seen, the tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. There is upper zone re-distribution, with resolving CHF. Minimal patchy opacity at both lung bases is similar to prior film, possibly slightly improved. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles is unchanged, without gross effusion. The left upper zone, which was obscured on the prior film, is grossly unremarkable. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Slight change in caliber in the proximal trachea is similar to the prior film. An area of relative widening is suggested in the proximal trachea. Again noted is tubing, catheters or drains in the upper abdomen, with skin ___.
