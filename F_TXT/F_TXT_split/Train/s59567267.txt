There is a retrocardiac lucency with a thick wall. Question if this is related to a hiatal hernia, but none seen on prior barium swallow study. Does not appear to correspond to known epiphrenic diverticula. Cannot exclude a pulmonary process. Linear atelectasis is seen in the left mid lung. There is no effusion or pneumothorax. The there is mild cardiomegaly. There are old right sided rib deformites.
