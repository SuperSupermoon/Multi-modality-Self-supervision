Again seen is the abandoned pacer lead with tip in the right atrium in unchanged position and left-sided PICC line with tip in the mid SVC. There is increased alveolar infiltrate in the right involving the lower lobe predominantly. There is also increased volume loss in the right lower lobe. There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right with volume loss/infiltrate in the left lower lobe. Overall, the appearance of the lungs is slightly worse on today's study. Note that history is of repeat intubation, however no ET tube is visualized and the outline of an oxygen mask is seen.
