AP portable upright chest radiograph obtained. Several calcified pleural plaques project over the lungs. There is no definite sign of pneumonia or CHF. No large effusion is seen, though the left CP angle is excluded. There is no pneumothorax. The heart is within normal limits of size. A retrocardiac density containing gas lucency is compatible with a hiatal hernia. The aorta is somewhat unfolded with partially calcified aortic knob. Bony structures appear intact with an old left mid clavicular shaft deformity.
