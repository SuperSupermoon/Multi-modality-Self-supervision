Asymmetrically distributed bilateral airspace opacities have slightly worsened in the interval, particularly in the right upper lobe. These findings could potentially be due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but coexisting infection should be considered, particularly for the right upper lobe opacity. Large left pleural effusion and small-to-moderate right pleural effusion have both slightly decreased in size in the interval. Otherwise, no relevant short interval change since the recent radiograph.
