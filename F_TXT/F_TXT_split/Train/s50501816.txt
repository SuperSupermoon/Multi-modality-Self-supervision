Tracheostomy tube is seen well positioned in the trachea. A left PICC line extends to the mid portion of the SVC. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Lower lung volumes exaggerate bibasilar opacities which appear more confluent and severe on today's examination. There is increased mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No definite pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
