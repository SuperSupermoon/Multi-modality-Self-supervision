As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing parenchymal opacity at the right lung base is minimally more extensive than on the previous exam. The pre-existing signs of combined fluid overload and areas of parenchymal opacities, predominating in the right upper lobe, are constant. Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis. Unchanged bilateral blunting of the costophrenic sinuses, potentially indicative of small pleural effusions.
