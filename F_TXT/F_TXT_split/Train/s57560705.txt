Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 5.4 cm above the carina, and could be advanced slightly for standard positioning. Apparent asymmetry of the tube with respect to the trachea lumen probably reflects rotation. Large left layering pleural effusion has increased in size, and a small to moderate right pleural effusion has also developed. Diffuse haziness of upper abdomen suggests possible ascites but is not specific for this finding.
