The patient is status-post a gastric-pull up for esophageal cancer. A large bubble of air overlying the right hemithorax is air within the thoracic portion of the stomach. There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. A small linear right basilar opacity likely reflects chronic atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no new opacity, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
