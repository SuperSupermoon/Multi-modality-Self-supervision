Extensive subcutaneous emphysema has markedly progressed from the prior exam, now involving the entire chest, the neck bilaterally, and left shoulder with re- demonstration of an extensively comminuted left proximal humeral fracture. Left basilar chest tube is new. Assessment for residual pneumothorax is somewhat limited, but likely a small pneumothorax persists. Previously seen mild rightward shift of mediastinal structures is slightly improved. Small pneumomediastinum is also unchanged. There is persistent opacification in the left lung base likely reflecting atelectasis. Right upper lobe peripheral linear and hazy opacity likely reflects a combination of known laceration and adjacent contusion. This is subjacent to a displaced comminuted left lateral 3rd rib fracture. Low lung volumes are present. Marked subcutaneous emphysema somewhat limits assessment of the underlying lung parenchyma. Probable right basilar atelectasis is visualized. Small left pleural effusion persists. No large right pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
