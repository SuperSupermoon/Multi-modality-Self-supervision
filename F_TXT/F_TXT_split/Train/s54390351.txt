As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube was inserted. The tip of the tube is in the middle parts of the stomach. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unchanged, with multiple nodular and interstitial lesions as well as a mediastinal lesion at the level of the azygos vein. The extent of a small left pleural effusion is constant.
