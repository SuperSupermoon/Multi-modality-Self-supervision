A portable frontal chest radiograph redemonstrates irregular aeration of the left lung, particularly the lingula and lower lobe, which is no worse than on prior radiograph. The right lung and cardiomediastinal silhouette are unchanged. There is a residual small left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
