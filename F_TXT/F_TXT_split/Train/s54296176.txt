Portable semi-erect AP view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior studies. An endotracheal tube's tip ends 5-6 cm above the carina. A right-sided chest tube crosses the mid lung obliquely. A right-sided PICC line ends in the upper right atrium. A Dobbhoff tube ends in the upper stomach. Opacification has increased in the right upper lobe. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged in the remainder of the lungs. Minimal right apical pneumothorax, pulmonary venous engorgement and a moderate left pleural effusion are also unchanged. Heart size is normal.
