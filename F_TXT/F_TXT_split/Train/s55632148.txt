An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.9 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present. The tip is difficult to trace, but it appears to extend beneath the diaphragm, beyond the inferior edge of the film. Allowing for considerable rotation due to scoliosis, the right PICC line tip overlies the distal SVC near the SVC/ RA junction. There is possible minimal upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. There is patchy increased retrocardiac density, slightly improved compared with 1 day earlier. Otherwise, no focal infiltrate. No gross effusion.
