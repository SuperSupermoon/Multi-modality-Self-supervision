In comparison with the study of ___, the Dobbhoff tube has been removed. The left subclavian catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt is again seen.

The nodular density overlying the first rib in the right apex is unchanged from the study of ___. It is unclear whether this represents a calcified granuloma or possibly a bone island in the first rib.
