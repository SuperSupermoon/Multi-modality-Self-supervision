Compared to chest radiographs from ___, new opacification in the left mid and lower lung could represent aspiration or asymmetric pulmonary edema. Increasing retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with atelectasis, though aspiration cannot be excluded. The heart is moderately enlarged, increased from prior. No appreciable pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Platelike atelectasis in the right mid-to-lower lung persists.
