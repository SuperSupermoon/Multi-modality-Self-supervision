Patient is rotated somewhat to the left. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.0 cm above the level of the carina. A right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter is seen, extending to the expected location of the cavoatrial junction. Thoracolumbar scoliosis is seen. There is coarse increase in markings bilaterally which could be due to chronic pulmonary disease. However, additional areas of patchy opacity bilaterally could be due to multifocal infection; pulmonary hemorrhage is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion seen, but small bilateral pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. No definite pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. No displaced fracture is seen.
