As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The tip of the nasogastric tube is not included on the film. The side-hole, however, is positioned at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. No complications. The other monitoring and support devices, including the endotracheal tube, are in unchanged position.
