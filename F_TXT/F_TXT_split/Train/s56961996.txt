Comparison is made to the prior study from ___ at 5:56 a.m. There are bilateral chest tubes, endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and a right-sided subclavian catheter. Endotracheal tube is again positioned quite high, 8 cm above the carina. This could be advanced 2-3 cm for more optimal placement. There is again seen area of consolidation within the right mid and lower lung field. This is stable. There is some atelectasis at the left lung base, also stable. No pneumothoraces are identified.
