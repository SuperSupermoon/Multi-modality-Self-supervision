There is a large loculated left-sided pleural effusion with concurrent left lower lobe consolidation obscuring the left lower hemithorax and the left heart border, hindering assessment of heart size. A hazy opacity in the left upper lung field does not appear significantly changed when compared with prior radiograph from outside institution allowing for technical differences and may reflect layering fluid. The right lung shows some streaky opacity at the base, likely patchy atelectasis. There is no right-sided pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
