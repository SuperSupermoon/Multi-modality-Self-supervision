AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 2:48 p.m.: Small right apical pneumothorax is considerably smaller than it was nine hours ago, apical pleural tube still in place. No appreciable right pleural effusion. Small left pleural effusion may be present. Left basal atelectasis has improved. Heart size mildly enlarged but unchanged. No pulmonary edema. Subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall has worsened, presumably due to leakage of draining pleural air around the chest tube insertion site. Followup advised. Feeding tube ends in the stomach.
