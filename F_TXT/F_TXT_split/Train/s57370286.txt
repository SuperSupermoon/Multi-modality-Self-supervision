As compared to the previous radiograph, the parenchymal opacities that pre-existed bilaterally have slightly increased in extent and severity. The combination of pneumonia and pulmonary edema is likely. There is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. Status post fall, no safe evidence for rib fractures or other bony lesions. The presence of a moderate right pleural effusion cannot be excluded, given blunting of the right costophrenic sinus.
