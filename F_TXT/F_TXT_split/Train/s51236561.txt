Right internal jugular large bore catheter and left subclavian central line are unchanged. Status post median sternotomy with overall stably enlarged cardiac and mediastinal contours. There continue to be some scattered streaky opacities at the right base and in the left mid and lower lung likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. However, there is now a component of superimposed mild interstitial edema. No large effusions. No pneumothorax.
