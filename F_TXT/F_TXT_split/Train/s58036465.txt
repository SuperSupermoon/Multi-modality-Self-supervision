Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. The NG tube tip is too proximal, most likely at the gastroesophageal junction and should be further advanced since the side hole is at the level of mid esophagus. Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance. Bilateral pleural effusions appear to be slightly increased as well as right lower lobe opacities that might reflect developing infectious process. There is no pneumothorax.
