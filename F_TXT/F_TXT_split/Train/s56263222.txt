No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion. On this single frontal view, no definite focal pneumonia is appreciated, though there is some asymmetric opacification at the right base that could merely represent prominent vessels. If clinically possible, a PA and lateral view would be most helpful to demonstrate or exclude superimposed pneumonia.
