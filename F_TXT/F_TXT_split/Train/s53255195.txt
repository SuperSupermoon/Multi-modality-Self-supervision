AP portable upright view of the chest. In this patient with known left lower lobe mass, a fiducial marker projects over the cardiac silhouette. There is interval improvement in overall aeration in the left upper lobe. Mild persistent perihilar opacity persists which may represent residual atelectasis or may be related to known hilar mass. There is stable blunting of the right CP angle which may represent pleural thickening or tiny effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unchanged. The imaged osseous structures appear intact.
