Compared to the prior film, an NG/OG type tube is present. The tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off film. Again seen is the ET tube, partially obscured by the OG tube, but with tip approximately 5.4 cm above the carina. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary findings are similar to the prior film.
