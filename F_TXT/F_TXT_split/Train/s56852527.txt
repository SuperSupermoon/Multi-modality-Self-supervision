Following AAA repair, there is an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the right pulmonary artery. Nasogastric tube takes a circuitous course with the tip in the region of the distal esophagus. There are low lung volumes which probably accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart and fullness of the pulmonary vessels.
