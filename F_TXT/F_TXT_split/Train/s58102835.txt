Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Lung volumes remain very low. Increased left lung base opacity may represent either edema or pneumonia. No pneumothorax. Round calcification overlying the left heart is consistent with a left ventricular aneurysm. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
