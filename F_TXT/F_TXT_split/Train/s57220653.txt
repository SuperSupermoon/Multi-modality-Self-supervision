Vascular catheter terminates in the mid superior vena cava. Right apical scarring and calcified granuloma appear unchanged. Lungs are otherwise clear except for a nonspecific patchy and linear opacity at the left lung base, which favors atelectasis. Given clinical suspicion for pneumonia, followup PA and lateral radiographs may be helpful for more complete characterization of this region. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal in appearance except for a calcified lymph node in the lower right paratracheal region.
