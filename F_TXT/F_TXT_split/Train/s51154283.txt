Endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm above the carina, a single lead from left pectoral ICD device ends into the right ventricle, right internal jugular sheath tip is in lower SVC, right subclavian line reaches till cavoatrial junction/right upper atrium, and orogastric tube can extends to stomach but its tip is beyond radiographic view. Right lower lung volume loss due to right lower lobe collapse is overall unchanged and any contribution from middle lobe collapse is indeterminate. Increased retrocardiac density suggesting left lower lung atelectasis has minimally worsened since yesterday. Pleural effusions, if any, are small bilaterally and unchanged. Moderately enlarged heart size is stable. No acute changes in the chest.
