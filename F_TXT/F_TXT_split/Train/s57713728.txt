Tracheostomy tube is in stable position. Left subclavian central line terminates in the mid SVC. The heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Indistinct pulmonary markings are similar to prior, compatible with mild edema. Increased bilateral basilar opacities are compatible with increased small pleural effusions, right greater than left, with adjacent atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
