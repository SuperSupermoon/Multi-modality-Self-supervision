Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.6 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen, extending below the level of the diaphragm, off the inferior aspect of the image. Calcification projecting over the cardiac silhouette may be due to mitral annulus calcification. Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles may be due to small bilateral pleural effusions. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. Bibasilar opacities are seen, worrisome for multifocal pneumonia or aspiration/contusion depending on clinical situation. A tubular structure/drain is seen projecting over the right upper abdomen.
