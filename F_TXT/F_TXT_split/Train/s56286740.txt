AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes have improved, left pleural effusion has decreased, heart size is normal and mediastinal veins are no longer dilated. There is some residual atelectasis at the left lung base, but this is the only radiographically obvious explanation for continued respiratory insufficiency. No pneumothorax is present. Right PICC line ends in the mid SVC.
