Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with similar widening of the superior mediastinum, potentially due to mediastinal lipomatosis. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are mild multilevel degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
