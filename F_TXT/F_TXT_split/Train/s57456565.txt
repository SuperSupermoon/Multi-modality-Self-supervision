Low lung volumes, with atelectasis at left-greater-than-right base. This may account for an area of increased density at the left base medially. Upper zone redistribution, likely accentuated by low lung volumes. No CHF. No effusion or pneumothorax detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
