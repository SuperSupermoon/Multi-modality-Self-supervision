The field of view is tailored to visualization of a nasogastric tube and does not completely image the lung parenchyma. A nasogastric tube passes into the stomach where it makes a single coil. To the extent visualized, the cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. The partly visualized left costophrenic sulcus shows slight blunting so there may be a small pleural effusion.
