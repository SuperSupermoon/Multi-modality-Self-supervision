Moderately severe pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions have worsened since earlier in the day. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Note is made of extremely heavy calcification of the mitral annulus which can contribute to mitral regurgitation. A metal ___ pin projecting over the upper midline trachea is presumably external, but should be evaluated clinically. Right jugular catheter ends in the low SVC. Transvenous right atrial ventricular pacer leads are in standard. No pneumothorax.
