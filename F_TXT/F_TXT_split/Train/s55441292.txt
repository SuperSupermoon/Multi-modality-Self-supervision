An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating below the thoracic inlet, approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip and sideport in the proximal stomach. The patient is status post median sternotomy. A coronary stent projects over the left border of the heart. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. Prominence at the right paramedian stripe appearing relatively lucent on radiography likely represents prominent mediastinal vessels. A small right pleural effusion may be present. No significant hemothorax is seen on this single supine view. Hazy airspace opacities in the right middle and lower lung zones with smaller airspace opacities in the left mid lung zone may reflect atelectasis. The pulmonary vasculature is essentially within normal limits. Healed right lateral rib fractures are noted.
