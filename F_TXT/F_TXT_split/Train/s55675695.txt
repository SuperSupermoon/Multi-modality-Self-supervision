The patient is status post esophageal stenting with two radiopaque stents in place. The upper stent has been repositioned, extending from the thoracic inlet into the proximal esophagus to level of the carina; the lower stent extends from the distal esophagus to the level of the GE junction. There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Bilateral linear and subsegmental atelectasis is again noted. Previously described airspace opacities have resolved. There is stable cardiomegaly despite the projection. Spinal degenerative changes are present.
