Heart size is normal. Hilar contours are unremarkable. There are widespread left greater than right opacities compatible with pulmonary edema which is exaggerated by extremely low lung volumes and concurrent left lung base atelectasis. There is no effusion or pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube is in place, 4 cm cranial to the carina in standard position. A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter terminates at the distal SVC. An upper enteric tube is in place in the distal stomach out of view of imaging.
