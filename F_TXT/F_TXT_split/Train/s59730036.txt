Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with persistent right apical pneumothorax, minimally increased in size from the prior radiograph. Other diffuse abnormalities including widespread pulmonary metastases appear similar to the prior study, but heterogeneous consolidation in the left lung superimposed upon metastases have slightly worsened and may represent an additional site of infection. Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are not appreciably changed.
