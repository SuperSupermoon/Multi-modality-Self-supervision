Mild to moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal venous engorgement are stable. Bibasilar consolidation has worsened, probably progressive edema on the right, but conceivably pneumonia on the left. Tracheostomy in standard position, with no evidence of complication. Transesophageal drainage tube ends in the midportion of the nondistended stomach. No pneumothorax.
