Endotracheal tube appears in place with the tip in the lower trachea. Right PICC line is unchanged with the tip in the mid SVC. Enteric tube tip traverses to the stomach. The lungs appear hyperinflated consistent with patient's underlying emphysema. Volume loss is again noted, particularly on the right with rightward shift of the mediastinum. Since the prior study, there has been increased vascular congestion suggestive of heart failure. Additionally, there is increased right basilar atelectasis. Bilateral small pleural effusions appear stable. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouette appears stable. Levoscoliosis of the mid thoracic spine is again noted.
