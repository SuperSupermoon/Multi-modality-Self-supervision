In comparison with the study of ___, there is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip about 4 cm above the carina. The right PICC line extends into the right atrium, further than on the previous study, approximately 2 cm above the carina. There appears to be some increased engorgement of pulmonary vessels consistent with further elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. The hemidiaphragms are not as sharply seen, consistent with atelectatic changes and possible small effusions.
