Since earlier same day chest radiograph, mild pulmonary edema is slightly worse, bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left, are unchanged, and bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left, are increased. Lucency in right upper quadrant of the abdomen is potentially projectional, although free air or basilar pneumothorax may produce a similar appearance. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. Known rib deformities are again noted. Tip of the endotracheal tube is seen 2.3 cm above the carina. A feeding tube is seen in the stomach and can be advanced further.
