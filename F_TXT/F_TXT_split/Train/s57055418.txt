The lungs are reasonably well expanded. Left retrocardiac streak the airspace opacity likely reflects atelectasis. The bilateral costophrenic angles are slightly blunted, which may be secondary to small effusion, atelectasis, scarring, or patient body habitus. A rounded nodular opacity overlies the right upper lung and distal clavicle, and is incompletely localized on this single image. There is no large pneumothorax or frank pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
