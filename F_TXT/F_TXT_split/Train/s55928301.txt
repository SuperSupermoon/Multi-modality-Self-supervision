A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably with the patient in the upright position. The study is limited due to patient's body habitus. Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Small pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Hilar contours are normal allowing for lung volumes.
