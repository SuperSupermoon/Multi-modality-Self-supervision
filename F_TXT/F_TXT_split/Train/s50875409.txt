In comparison with the chest radiograph obtained 11 hours earlier, there has been no clear change in Dobhoff tube positioning - it passes into the distal stomach and outside the field of view. There is increased bibasilar atelectasis. Pleural effusions are small, if any. Severe cardiomegaly and postoperative mediastinal widening are unchanged. No pneumothorax. A left-sided IJ central venous catheter terminates at the origin of the SVC and a right-sided IJ central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium.
