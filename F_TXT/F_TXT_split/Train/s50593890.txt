There are low lung volumes. The heart size is normal. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Otherwise the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is likely atelectasis at the lung bases. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified, though the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are noted.
