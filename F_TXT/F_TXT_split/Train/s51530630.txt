Status post right Port-A-Cath placement. Correct position of the device. Right-sided chest tube in place. Moderate right pleural effusion. Extensive left pleural effusion, potentially with a larger collapsed left lung portion. Extensive cardiomegaly. All findings can be explained by the thoracoscopy and the pleurodesis. However, the left hemithorax should be checked on short term radiographic followup for the potential presence of a pneumothorax.
