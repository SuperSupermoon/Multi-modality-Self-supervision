Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Predominantly linear opacities are present at both lung bases. The appearance favors atelectasis over an infectious pneumonia. A slightly more confluent nodular opacity adjacent to the left heart border appears unchanged and may reflect a nodular focus of atelectasis or scarring. If clinical suspicion for pneumonia persists, standard PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for more complete evaluation of the lungs.
