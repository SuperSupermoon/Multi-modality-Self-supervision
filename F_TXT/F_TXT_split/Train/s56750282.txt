Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Enlargement of central pulmonary arteries is suggestive of pulmonaryhypertension in this patient with chronic interstitial fibrosis. Moderate right pleural effusion persists, with adjacent opacity (atelectasis, consolidation or contusion) in the right lower lobe, as well as multiple right-sided rib fractures. There is no visible pneumothorax.
