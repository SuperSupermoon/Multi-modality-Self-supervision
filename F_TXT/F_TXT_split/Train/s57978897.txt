Again seen are 2 chest tubes at the base of the right lung, where a small pneumothorax is present. As before, there is some density at the base of the right lung parenchyma, likely atelectasis. Also as before, there is fluid and/or pleural thickening tracking from the lung apex down along the right chest wall. However, the right costophrenic angle remains well-defined, without interval accumulation of right pleural fluid. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle is similar to the prior film.
