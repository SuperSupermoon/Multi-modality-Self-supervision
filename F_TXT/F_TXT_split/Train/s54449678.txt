AP chest compared to ___, 5:27 p.m.: Mild mediastinal widening, consistent with mediastinal adenopathy seen on chest CT ___ has improved, probably a function of decreased central venous volume. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Mild right basal atelectasis is improved. The upper airway is partially imaged. It does show some coving of the subglottic airway, which could be due to edema. Radiographic evaluation of that area would consist of airway views of the neck in frontal and lateral projection. Direct observation would probably be more productive.
