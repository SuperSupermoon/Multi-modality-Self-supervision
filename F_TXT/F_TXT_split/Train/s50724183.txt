There remains complete collapse of the left lung, with co-existing left pleural effusion, as demonstrated on recent CT of ___. Central left mass and bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy are shown to better detail on that study as well. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by mild interstitial edema in the right lung, though the nonspecific area of opacity at the right base, probably due to localized atelectasis adjacent to a known small right pleural effusion. Calcified pleural plaques and calcified granulomas are also noted in the right hemithorax.
