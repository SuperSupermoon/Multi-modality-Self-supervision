1 portable view. Lung volumes are low. There is hazy increased density at the lung bases likely representing pleural fluid. The retrocardiac area is not well penetrated and there is a suggestion of air bronchograms in the lower right lung. The cardiac silhouette appears large although cardiac size may be exaggerated by technical factors. Mediastinal structures are otherwise unremarkable. An endotracheal tube is present and terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is in place and terminates well below the diaphragm, off of the bottom of the image. A no other radiopaque catheter is projected over the lower left chest, with its tip projected over the left hilus.
