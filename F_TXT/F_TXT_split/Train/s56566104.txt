ET tube tip is 2.3 cm above the carinal. Left subclavian line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Since the prior study there has been interval progression of perihilar and lower lobe opacities, that might potentially reflect progression of pulmonary edema. A superimposed pulmonary edema on the pre-existing ARDS is the likely possibility. Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Tubes and lines in appropriate position. There is no pneumothorax.
