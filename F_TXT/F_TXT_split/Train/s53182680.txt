Single AP view of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a nasogastric tube which is seen coursing through the esophagus and below the left hemidiaphragm, with tip projecting over the fundus of the stomach. The lungs are well expanded, with no evidence of pneumothorax, focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pulmonary vascular congestion. There is persistent minimal subsegmental bibasilar atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
