Moderate right pleural effusion is larger today, obscuring any abnormalities in the right lower lobe. Left lower lobe remains densely consolidated, possibly atelectatic. Moderate cardiomegaly and small left pleural effusion have also increased. Left basal drainage catheter in either the chest or pericardium is unchanged in position. New opacification in the midlung zones bilaterally is probably edema. Dual channel hemodialysis catheter ends in the right atrium.
