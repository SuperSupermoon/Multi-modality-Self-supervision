Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained. A right sided HD catheter terminates in the lower SVC. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged with mild pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are present with associated bibasilar atelectasis. Indentation on the left trachea may reflect an enlarged goiter.
