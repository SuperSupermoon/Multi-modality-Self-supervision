There has been interval placement of a chest tube which ends in the right mid hemithorax whic has resulted in nearly total resolution of the right-sided pneumothorax with some residual pleural air seen in the right apex. Otherwise, lung volumes are low. There is mild vascular congestion but no focal opacities. Cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion.
