AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. Prominence of the azygos vein location is redemonstrated. As previously suggested it might potentially represent lymphadenopathy. Left lower lobe atelectasis has progressed since the prior study. Mild edema has progressed to moderate edema, still interstitial. Left pleural effusion is most likely moderate-to-large as compared to most likely moderate right pleural effusion.
