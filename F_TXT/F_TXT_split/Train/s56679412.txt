Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 04:22. Small left apical pneumothorax has developed. 2 left thoracostomy tubes are unchanged in their respective positions. Greater opacification throughout the right lung could be due to concurrent edema, but multifocal pneumonia was suggested by the chest CT performed yesterday.
