As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing bilateral pleural effusions distribute in a slightly different manner given different patient position. The overall extent, however, is likely unchanged. The size of the cardiac silhouette, slightly enlarged, is also unchanged. No reaccumulation of pulmonary edema has occurred. No pneumothorax.
