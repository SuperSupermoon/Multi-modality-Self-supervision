The heart size is within normal limits. No typical configurational abnormality is identified. Unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta contour. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. There exists a right-sided paramediastinal density within the concave outer contour most likely representing an atelectasis of the apical portion of the right upper lobe. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. No other acute pulmonary abnormalities are seen on this portable chest examination. As our records do not include a preceding chest examination, the scout film of a PET-CT examination transferred into our records and dated ___ was inspected. The atelectasis resembling right superior density existed already at that time.
