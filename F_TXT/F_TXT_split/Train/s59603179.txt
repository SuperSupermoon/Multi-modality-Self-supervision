There are low lung volumes, and crowding of normal bronchovascular structures. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable, possibly with mild cardiomegaly. Left lower lung opacity may represent atelectasis, however pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis post be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Right cardiophrenic angle opacity likely reflects crowding of normal bronchovascular structures. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. Difficult to exclude a small left pleural effusion. No right pleural effusion.
