Symmetric bibasilar, perihilar interstitial and airspace opacification accompanied by new mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement is due to pulmonary edema. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. Subsequent chest radiograph available the time of this review showed worsening pulmonary edema but decrease in cardiomegaly, probably reflecting on going diuresis.
