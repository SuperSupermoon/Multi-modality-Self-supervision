Mild edema has cleared from the upper lungs. It is difficult to say whether residual opacification in the lower lobes, particular the right is just atelectasis and dependent edema or whether there is also consolidation. Mild cardiac enlargement and small pleural effusions are unchanged, but both are probably exaggerated by extensive fat deposition. No pneumothorax.
