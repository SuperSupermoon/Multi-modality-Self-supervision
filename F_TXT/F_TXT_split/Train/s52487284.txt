Single portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates intact median sternotomy wires, and right IJ CVL tip in the upper right atrium unchanged in appearance since previous examination. Interval removal of enteric feeding tube, mediastinal drains, and endotracheal tube. Again seen is a large hiatal hernia, partially fluid-filled. The lungs are hypoinflated with bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions. Persistent retrocardiac and left lower lobe opacity is noted. No pneumothorax.
