Endotracheal tube remains stable in the trachea. Right internal jugular catheter remains in the lower SVC. Left-sided chest tube and left basal pigtail catheter are again visualized in unchanged position. Again visualized is a small left apical pneumothorax, which appears stable in size. Rightward shift of normally midline structures again noted but difficult to compare due to differences in rotation. The cardiac silhouette appears stable. Again visualized are stable right upper lobe, right lower lobe and lingular opacities as well as a small right pleural effusion.
