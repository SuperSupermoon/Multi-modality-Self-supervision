There is increased atelectasis in the right upper and right lower lung as well as in the right middle lobe, potentially related to termination of mechanical ventilation. Left retrocardiac consolidation is substantial. There is no pneumothorax. There is no appreciable pleural effusion on the left but there is effusion on the right. Interval improvement of pulmonary edema is demonstrated.
