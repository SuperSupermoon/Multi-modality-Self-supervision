A portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left PICC with the tip at the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC, unchanged in position compared to most recent chest radiograph. Lung volumes are slightly low, resulting in prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
