As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is still intubated, the nasogastric tube and the right internal jugular vein catheter are in unchanged position. The size of the cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. There is unchanged evidence of moderate pulmonary edema and areas of parenchymal opacities, predominating on the right, and likely reflecting atelectasis. In addition, the signs indicative of multifocal pneumonia are constant in appearance. No new parenchymal opacities.
