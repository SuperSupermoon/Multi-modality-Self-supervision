Currently, the right lung is almost completely re-expanded, with only a minimal millimetric right apical pneumothorax persisting. Substantial improvement of the pre-existing right basal areas of atelectasis. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions.
