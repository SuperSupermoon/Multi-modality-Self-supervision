AP chest compared to ___: ET tube, 2 cm above the carina, previously in the right main bronchus,would have required re-positioning, but I have been informed that it has been removed since this radiograph was performed. Three left pleural tubes are still in place, and only a small left pleural effusion persists. Tiny left apical pneumothorax is not clinically significant. Left lower lobe opacification, probably atelectasis, unchanged.
