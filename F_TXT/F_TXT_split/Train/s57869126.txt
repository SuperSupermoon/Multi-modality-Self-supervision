In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there has been substantial improvement in pulmonary edema. Multiple rib fractures and right clavicular fracture are unchanged. No obvious pneumothorax. There is increased bibasilar atelectasis and new, small, bilateral pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are essentially unchanged in position. An NG tube side port projects just distal to the GE junction. An ET tube terminates 6 cm above the carina.
