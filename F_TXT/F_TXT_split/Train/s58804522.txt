An ET tube is in place with the tip 3 cm above the carina. An enteric feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip in the stomach. A dual-lumen central catheter in the right IJ is unchanged with the tip terminating in the mid-to-low SVC. A left-sided chest tube is unchanged. Lucency projecting over the left lung base likely corresponds to the small left apical pneumothorax seen on the prior study which was performed in the semi-erect position. The right lung demonstrates no pneumothorax. No significant pleural effusion is seen. There is no new consolidation concerning for pneumonia. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
