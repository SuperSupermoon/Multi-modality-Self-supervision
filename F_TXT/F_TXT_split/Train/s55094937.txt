Swan-Ganz catheter has been placed, with tip terminating in the right infrahilar region, likely at the junction of the distal intralobar and lobar segment of the right pulmonary artery. This could be withdrawn several centimeters for standard positioning. Other indwelling devices remain in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Bilateral diffuse airspace opacities are new, and demonstrate relative sparing of the lung periphery. In conjunction with pulmonary vascular congestion, these findings are most likely due to acute pulmonary edema. Position of Swan Ganz catheter discussed with Dr. ___ at 8:30 am on ___ a the time of discovery.
