On this post-surgical film, a small right pleural effusion is noted. In addition, there is subtle lucency below the right hemidiaphragm, theoretically concerning for free abdominal air. The presence of abdominal air, however, has been excluded with an abdominal decubitus radiograph. The lung volumes are low. Moderate cardiomegaly with enlargement of the left ventricle, but no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
