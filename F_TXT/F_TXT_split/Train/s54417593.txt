Lung volumes are low. There is streaky density at the lung bases consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. There is additional hazy density at the right lung base suggestive of pleural fluid. A small focal area of consolidation at the right base cannot be excluded. The heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in place.
