The patient is status post tracheostomy. A right-sided PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava. The right lung is better aerated than on the prior study, but regarding the left lung, there is persistent opacification of the left lower lobe, which may be associated with atelectasis, consolidation and probably a substantial pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
