1. Persistent low lung volumes with patchy opacity at the left base which may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. However, when compared to the prior study there is no significant interval change. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given low lung volumes and differences in patient positioning between studies. Prominent amount of gas within the stomach. Left hemidiaphragm remains elevated. No pleural effusions.
