Endotracheal tube is seen with tip approximately 3 cm from the carina. NG tube passes off the inferior field of view. On the current exam, there is improved aeration of the left lung base with some persistent opacity seen laterally. The lungs are otherwise grossly clear. Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle could be due to atelectasis, overlying soft tissues or effusion. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but less so likely due to increased lung volumes.
