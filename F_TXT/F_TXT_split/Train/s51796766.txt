Tip of the endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Enteric tube extends to the body of the stomach. Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant. Bilateral reticular opacities likely represent a combination of bronchovascular crowding in the setting of low lung volumes and mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Additional note is made of bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, which may be due to atelectasis or aspiration. Heart size is top-normal. No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
