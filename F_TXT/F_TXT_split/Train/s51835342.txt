Findings are concerning for infection, perhaps atypical. Previous edema has largely cleared from the left lung. Heart size is top- normal. Left pleural effusion minimal if any. No pneumothorax. ET tube in standard placement. Right PIC line can be traced as far as the mid to low SVC but the tip is obscured.
