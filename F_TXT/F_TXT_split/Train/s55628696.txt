AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. There is interval decrease in the left pleural effusion related to thoracocentesis with overall improvement of the left lung aeration. Minimal left apical pneumothorax is present and should be further followed. Bibasal opacities are unchanged as well as the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Overall, no change in the pneumothorax as compared to prior examination demonstrated.
