1. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach. The side port likely lies just below the gastroesophageal junction. Right internal jugular central line and endotracheal tube are unchanged in position. The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable. There are persistent bilateral layering effusions with associated airspace opacity suggestive of compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. The consolidation at the left base has developed since the prior study. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
