Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a right internal jugular approach central venous catheter with tip extending to the cavo-brachiocephalic junction. An enteric tube is in place, extending inferiorly out of view. Since two days ago, there has been significant improvement of pulmonary edema, with interval decrease of pleural effusions. There is, however, persistent severe cardiomegaly. There is persistent consolidation in the left lower lobe and confluent opacity in the right upper lung, at least in part due to known underlying apical mass lesion with calcifications as correlated with prior CT. There is no pneumothorax. Patient is turned slightly to the right. There is no new acute process.
