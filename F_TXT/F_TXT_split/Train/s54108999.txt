There are no recent prior studies available for comparison. There are low lung volumes. Cardiac size is top normal. Large bilateral basal opacities, larger on the left side, are likely atelectasis on the right, but on the left are worrisome for aspiration. The right upper lobe is clear. There is minimal atelectasis in the left upper lobe. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
