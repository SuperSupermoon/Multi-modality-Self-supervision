Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Moderate right pleural effusion with air-fluid level suggests the presence of hydropneumothorax though the pleural line of the pneumothorax is not as conspicuous as before. Large left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is unchanged. Pulmonary edema has improved, now mild. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and widened mediastinum are stable. Sternal wires are aligned. Feeding tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
