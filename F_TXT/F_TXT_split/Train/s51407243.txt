1. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip 4.5 cm above the carina. Left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There continues to be a patchy bilateral airspace process and associated layering moderate-to-large right pleural effusion. These findings were shown to represent a combination of cavitary changes and ground-glass opacity on recent chest CT of ___ and are concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Overall, the radiographic appearance of the chest has not changed. No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-erect positioning. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in technique and positioning between studies.
