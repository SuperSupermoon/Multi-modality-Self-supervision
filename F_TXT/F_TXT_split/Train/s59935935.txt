Low lung volumes are present. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely top-normal. Apparent mediastinal widening may also likely be due to poor inspiratory volumes. Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis though infection, particularly in the right lung base, cannot be completely excluded. Small right pleural effusion appears to be present. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
