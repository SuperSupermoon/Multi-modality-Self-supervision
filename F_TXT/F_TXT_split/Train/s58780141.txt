Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Large subdiaphragmatic lucency appears to outline the diaphragm and the liver, and may represent a large pneumoperitoneum or a markedly distended viscous such as stomach or transverse colon. Endotracheal tube has been replaced with a tracheostomy tube. Right internal jugular central catheter terminates in the distal SVC. Sternotomy wires are intact. Moderate to large right and moderate left pleural effusions are slightly enlarged since prior with similar bibasilar opacities. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable with mild cardiomegaly.
