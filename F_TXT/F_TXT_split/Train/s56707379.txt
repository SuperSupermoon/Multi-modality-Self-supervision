Lines and tubes are similar to the prior film. Compared to the prior film, diffuse bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities are new or much more pronounced, slightly more pronounced on the right. The right minor fissure is slightly thickened and slightly retracted. There is increased retrocardiac density, with interval obscuration of the medial left hemidiaphragm. No gross effusions.
