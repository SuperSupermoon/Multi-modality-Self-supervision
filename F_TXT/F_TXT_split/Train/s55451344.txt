Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Dense retrocardiac opacity represents pleural effusion and atelectasis. Superimposed infection could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Fluid in the horizontal fissure on the right is stable. The right lung is relatively well aerated. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Two tubes course into the stomach and out of the field of view. Left-sided central line ends at the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
