AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding AP and lateral chest examination ___ ___. The bilateral basal densities have increased markedly since the preceding study and indicate reoccurrence of advanced CHF. Pleural effusion are more marked on the left side than the right. Also difficult to identify on the somewhat underexposed single view examination, there appears to be marked perivascular haze in the pulmonary circulation suggesting beginning pulmonary edema. Followup examination after treatment is recommended.
