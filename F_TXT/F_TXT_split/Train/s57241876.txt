Status post right thoracentesis, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Right pleural effusion has nearly resolved. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Multiple calcified pleural plaques are present bilaterally, in keeping with prior asbestos exposure. Patchy left basilar opacity probably represents atelectasis and less likely aspiration or infectious pneumonia.
