AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Cardiac silhouette is very large due to cardiomegaly, with or without pericardial effusion. In the absence of mediastinal vascular engorgement any pericardial effusion is not hemodynamically significant. Thoracic aorta is calcified in the ascending portion, but not dilated. Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable and lungs are clear. There is no appreciable pleural abnormality.
