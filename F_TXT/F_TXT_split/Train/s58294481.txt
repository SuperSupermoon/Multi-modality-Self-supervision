As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain very low. The endotracheal tube is now at the orifice of the right main bronchus and urgently needs to be pulled back. The nasogastric tube and the right internal jugular vein catheter are in correct position. Increasing opacities in the right lung, likely reflecting increasing pulmonary edema combines to atelectasis and a new right pleural effusion. Unchanged left retrocardiac atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
