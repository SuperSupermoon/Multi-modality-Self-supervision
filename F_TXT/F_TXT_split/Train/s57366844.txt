Since 2 days prior, diffuse interstitial opacities have significantly improved. No new opacities. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged with no pulmonary vascular congestion. The distal end of an ET tube is not clearly visualized as it is projecting over a superimposed enteric tube. The enteric tube tip terminates the proximal stomach with a side port that is probably in the distal esophagus. A right-sided IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
