The tracheostomy and left sided PICC line are again seen. The PICC line tip is slightly more distally now lies at the SVC/RA junction. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged. Allowing for technical differences, it is grossly unchanged. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips again noted. As before, there is increased retrocardiac density, with obscuration of left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, likely with a small to moderate left effusion. The degree of retrocardiac opacification is slightly worse. Also again seen is a small to moderate right pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior study. There is minimal , if any, upper zone redistribution. No pneumothorax detected.
