Rotated positioning. Left IJ central line tip in the region of the distal SVC/RA junction. There is upper zone redistribution and vascular blurring, consistent with CHF with interstitial edema. There is a moderate size right pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation at the right base. In addition, there is increased retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and probable small left effusion. Loops linear radiodensity overlying the lower left base, question outside the patient. This appears to correspond to something outside the chest on the prior film.
