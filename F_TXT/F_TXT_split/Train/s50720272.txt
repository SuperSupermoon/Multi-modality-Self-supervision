As on the previous image, several millimetric metallic particles are seen. The biggest of these particles projects over the region of the right atrium on the frontal image. Another particles appears to be located in the lingular. 2 additional barely visible particles with diameters be low 1 mm project over the left lung bases and are not clearly visualized on the previous cross-table image. No other change, no pneumothorax.
