Moderate right pleural effusion is probably larger today than on ___ despite the right basal pleural drainage catheter, responsible for persistent severe right lower lobe atelectasis. Greater mediastinal caliber in the right lower paratracheal station is probably due to greater venous engorgement, augmented by persistent mediastinal adenopathy. Heart is normal size. Left lung is grossly clear aside from mild basal atelectasis. ET tube in standard placement. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
