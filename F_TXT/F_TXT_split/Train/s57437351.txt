Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and accompanied by pulmonary vascular engorgement, mild perihilar edema and probable small pleural effusions. Bibasilar linear atelectasis is present. Additionally, a more focal patchy opacity is present in the inferior lingular region partially obscuring a small portion of the left heart border. Considering clinical suspicion for infection, PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for more complete evaluation of this region when the patient's condition permits.
