The heart is not enlarged. Aorta is calcified and tortuous. The appearance is similar to ___. Areas opacity at the right lung base extending to the level of the hilum, of uncertain etiology. Immediately above this there is a small amount of platelike atelectasis at the right base. Sharply defined linear lucency is seen at the right base, but the significance of this is unclear. Doubt but cannot entirely exclude loculated hydro pneumothorax. There is mild prominence of vessels, but no CHF. The left lung and remaining portion of the right lung is grossly clear, without focal infiltrate or consolidation. No gross left effusion. Elsewhere, no pneumothorax identified.
