A central venous catheter again terminates in the right atrium, passing through a left brachiocephalic stent, as before. The patient is also status post right shoulder replacement, as before. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including tortuosity and calcification along the aorta and a left ventricular configuration to the cardiac contour. The lung volumes are low, with streaky basilar opacities, which are more extensive in the left retrocardiac region than right and probably attributable to atelectasis. Pleural effusions and pneumonia are not completely excluded, however. There is no evidence for pneumothorax.
