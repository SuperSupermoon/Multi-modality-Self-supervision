In comparison with the earlier study of this date, with the chest tube on water seal there is no definite pneumothorax. Increased opacification at the left base could reflect pulmonary hemorrhage or developing aspiration or pneumonia. Less prominent area of increased opacification is seen at the right base medially. There is still dilatation of the gas-filled stomach after removal of the nasogastric tube.
