In comparison with the study of ___ the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The overlying ED board greatly obscures detail. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could represent elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The hemidiaphragms are not partially obscured with hazy opacification at the left base. This suggests layering pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. In view of the bilateral pulmonary changes and limitations due to the ED board, it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
