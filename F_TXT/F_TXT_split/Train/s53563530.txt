A single frontal portable view of the chest was performed. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Opacification at the left lung base is new from the prior study. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. The hilar structures and pleural surfaces are unremarkable. The imaged upper abdomen is grossly unremarkable.
