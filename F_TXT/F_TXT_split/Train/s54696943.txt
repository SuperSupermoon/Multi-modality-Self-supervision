As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is in a completely changed position. The endotracheal tube is in unchanged location. The size of the cardiac silhouette could have minimally increased, the apparent blunting of the left costophrenic sinus is probably defect of patient's position. There are no acute changes in the lung parenchyma, in particular no evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.
