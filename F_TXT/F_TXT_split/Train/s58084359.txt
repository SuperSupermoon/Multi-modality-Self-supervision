Lung volumes are low. The heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unchanged, with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted. The aorta is diffusely calcified. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema demonstrated. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. Pneumonia, however, cannot be completely excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
