As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen in the position of the endotracheal tube. The tip of the tube still projects 7 cm above the carinal. The gastric over distension has decreased. The nasogastric tube has been advanced and is coiled in the stomach, with the tip projecting towards the gastroesophageal junction. The lung volumes have increased, potentially reflecting increased ventilatory pressures. The right perihilar parenchymal opacity has decreased in extent. The perihilar opacity on the left is not substantially changed.
