Endotracheal tube tip terminates 5 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube tip is seen in coursing below the left hemidiaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted, but no overt pulmonary edema is seen. Minimal streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. Embolization coils are demonstrated within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
