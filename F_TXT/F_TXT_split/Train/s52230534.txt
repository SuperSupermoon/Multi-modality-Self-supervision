The newly placed Dobhoff tube tip is just to the left of midline in the mid to lower left hemithorax - its position is unclear and could be in the lung or esophagus. The stylet is still in the Dobhoff tube. No pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary edema is new from the prior exam. Increased opacity in the left lower lung and infrahilar region also suggests superimposed aspiration. Overall stable heart size. Prominent mediastinum is also overall unchanged and may be secondary to tortuous or ectatic thoracic aorta and pulmonary vascular fullness. No definite pleural effusion.
