A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Streaky opacities at the left lung base are consistent with atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise well aerated and clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Incidentally noted is an air distended esophagus.
