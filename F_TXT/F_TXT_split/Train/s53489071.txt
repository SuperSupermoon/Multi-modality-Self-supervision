The lower lungs have been excluded from the study. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged. Mediastinal and cardiac moderate enlargement is also stable. Bilateral moderate pleural effusion with atelectasis is probably unchanged. Tracheostomy is in adequate position. There is also a right-sided PICC line that ends in mid SVC and a left jugular catheter that is in the cavoatrial junction.
