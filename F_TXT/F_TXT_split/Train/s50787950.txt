The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the bilateral hemidiaphragms, compatible with COPD. There is opacification of the right perihilar region and right lung base medially, obscuring the right heart border, which raises the possibility of right middle lobe pneumonia. There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which may represent a small right pleural effusion. The left lung is relatively clear. No pneumothorax is present. The pulmonary vasculature is slightly indistinct. There is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits with a tortuous thoracic aorta and minimal calcification of the aortic knob.
