The lungs are hyperexpanded. There are increased predominantly central and perihilar patchy airspace opacities consistent with worsening pulmonary edema, although multifocal pneumonia remains a possibility in the proper clinical context. Unchanged biapical pleuroparenchymal thickening. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. The size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. The thoracic aorta appears tortuous. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects at the level of the clavicular heads, 6.4 cm from the carina.
