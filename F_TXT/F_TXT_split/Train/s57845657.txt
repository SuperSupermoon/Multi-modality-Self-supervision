Endotracheal tube, left subclavian central line and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. The side port of the nasogastric tube remains in the distal esophagus and advancement of this tube is recommended once again. Lung volumes remain low with minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region favoring atelectasis rather than pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
