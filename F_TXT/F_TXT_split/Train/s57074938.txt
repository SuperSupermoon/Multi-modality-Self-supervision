AP chest compared to ___ at 4:44 a.m.: Diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality which progressed from ___ through ___ is probably worse, given greater radiodensity despite larger lung volumes. Widespread abnormality is looking less and less like simple pulmonary edema. It could be atypical pneumonia, and the left perihilar component could be the same or a second pathogen. There could of course be some component of recoverable pulmonary edema. Findings were discussed by telephone with the house officer caring for this patient at 10:30 a.m.
