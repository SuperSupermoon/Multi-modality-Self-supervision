Comparison is made to previous study from ___. The endotracheal tube tip has been pulled back slightly and the tip is now 5 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. There is a new right IJ central line distal lead tip at the distal SVC, appropriately sited. There are no focal consolidation or pleural effusions. There are low lung volumes causing mild atelectasis at the lung bases.
