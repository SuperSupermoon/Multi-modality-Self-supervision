Heart size is normal. Again noted are bilateral central perihilar opacities which are slightly improved on the right, but slightly worse on the left. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A right PICC remains in place in the low SVC. An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position, 3 cm cranial to the carina. An NG tube is in appropriate position with tip in the distal stomach.
