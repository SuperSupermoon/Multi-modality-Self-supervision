A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the mid-to-lower SVC. A Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and coiling in the left upper quadrant, likely within the gastric fundus. The lungs are symmetrically well expanded without pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heterogeneous opacification of the right lung base is unchanged. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Multiple surgical clips in the right axilla are compatible with prior lymph node dissection.
