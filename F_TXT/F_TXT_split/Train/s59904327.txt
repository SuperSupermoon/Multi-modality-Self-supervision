Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Again seen is prominence of the interstitial markings particularly in the mid-to-lower lungs similar to prior in this patient with suggestion of pulmonary fibrosis possibly slightly improved as compared to the prior study. The patient's reported right upper lobe spiculated opacity seen on prior PET-CT from ___ was better evaluated on that study. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable.
