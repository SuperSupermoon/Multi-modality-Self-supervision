Right internal jugular dual-lumen large bore catheter has its tip in the mid SVC. The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged position with its tip in the distal SVC. There are layering bilateral effusions with increasing prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggestive of worsening mild pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
