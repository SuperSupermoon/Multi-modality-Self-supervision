In comparison with the study of ___, the more tenting a or EO however ___ there are lower lung volumes with continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and probable worsening vascular congestion. Hazy opacification of the bases is consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. The retrocardiac region shows substantial opacification consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe. Marked obliquity of the patient makes it difficult to assess for the possibility of mediastinal shift. No evidence of pneumothorax. Monitoring and support devices remain in good position.
