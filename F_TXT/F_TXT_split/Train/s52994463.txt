In comparison with the study of ___, the right subclavian PICC line is now in the upper portion of the SVC. Hemodialysis catheter extends to the right atrium. There is hazy opacification at the right base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with layering effusion and compressive atelectasis at the right base. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion, the left lung is essentially clear.
