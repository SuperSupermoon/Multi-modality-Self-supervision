There are bilateral regions of reticulonodular opacities predominantly involving the lower and mid lungs, similar in distribution to previous chest x-ray. There continues to be obscuration of the right heart border and left hemidiaphragm, probably reflecting a degree of atelectasis. Left PICC line is similar in position. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
