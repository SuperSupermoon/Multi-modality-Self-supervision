Upright portable view of the chest demonstrates normal lung volumes. Costophrenic angles are blunted bilaterally, suggestive of small pleural effusions. There is moderate cardiomegaly and upper lobe vascular redistribution are chronic. Predominantly bibasilar redistribution of airspace opacities over the past three hours is good evidence that the process is hydrostatic edema. The most pronounced opacification, in the right upper lobe, abutting the minor fissure, might well be concurrent pneumonia. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Descending aorta is slightly tortuous with aortic arch calcifications. There is no pneumothorax. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
