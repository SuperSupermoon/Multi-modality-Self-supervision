The patient is status post aortic valve replacement and probably coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A right internal jugular venous catheter terminates at approximately the confluence of the right internal jugular vein with the right subclavian. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is similar volume loss at the left lung base with patchy atelectasis. It is difficult to exclude a pleural effusion on the left. There is no indication of pleural effusion on the right.
