Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier. Widened mediastinum is unchanged. Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema has worsened. NG tube tip is 1.8 cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter tip is in the right atrium, can be withdrawal a couple of centimeters for more standard position. There are low lung volumes. Bibasilar atelectases are larger on the left side. There is no evident pneumothorax. Bilateral small pleural effusions are larger on the left side. NG tube tip is high, is in the mid esophagus, should be advanced for more standard position. Mediastinal and chest tubes are in place. In the followup study, NG tube has been repositioned.
