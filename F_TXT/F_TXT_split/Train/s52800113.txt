There is a large left-sided pneumothorax with collapse of the left lung. There is very slight shift of the mediastinum to the right and suggestion of slight widening of the rib interspaces on the left, raising concern for early tension. The right lung is clear. No pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal size. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
