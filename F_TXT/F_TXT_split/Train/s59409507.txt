Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. There are again seen bilateral chest tubes which are stable in position. No pneumothoraces are seen. There is a right-sided PICC line whose distal lead tip is in the proximal SVC. Overall, these findings are unchanged. There remains a mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.
