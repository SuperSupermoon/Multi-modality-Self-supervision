AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Reticulation at the right lung base could be bronchiectasis or pulmonary fibrosis. I do not see consolidation to suggest recent aspiration or pneumonia. Heart is mildly enlarged. Pleural effusions are small if any. Upper lungs are clear. Deformities of the right upper and middle ribs laterally could be all chronic trauma, but acute fracture or destructive lesions of the ribs could be present and would require dedicated imaging for assessment. Mediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal. There is no evidence of central lymph node enlargement.
