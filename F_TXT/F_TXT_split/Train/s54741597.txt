As compared to the previous image, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube was removed. The right internal jugular vein catheter and the aortic balloon pump are in unchanged position. The bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting a combination of pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions persist. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. No new opacities. No pneumothorax.
