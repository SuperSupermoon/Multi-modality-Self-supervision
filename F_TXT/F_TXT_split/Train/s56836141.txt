Endotracheal tube ends approximately 7.4 cm from the carina positioned at the level of the clavicular head. Consider advancing the ETT by 2 cm for better seating. Bilateral lung volumes remain low. An orogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, the distal end is beyond radiographic review. Lower lung atelectasis and presumed small pleural effusions are unchanged. There are no other new interval changes. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Multiple rib fractures are redemonstrated.
