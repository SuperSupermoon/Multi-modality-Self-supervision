1. Right internal jugular central line remains unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is stable retrocardiac consolidation with an associated effusion most likely representing partial lower lobe collapse, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. There is increasing opacification at the right base, which could reflect worsening atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered in this location as well. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Radiopaque material in the left upper quadrant likely related to ingested contrast for a recent video swallow. Old healed left-sided lower rib fractures. No acute bony abnormality is appreciated.
