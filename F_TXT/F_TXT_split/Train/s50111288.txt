Cardiac size is top-normal. There are persistent low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities have markedly worsened on the right. These opacities could be large areas of atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. The upper lungs are grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax. If any there is a small right effusion.
