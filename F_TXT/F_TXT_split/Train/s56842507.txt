A portable frontal view of the chest demonstrates unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema. There is increased opacity at the right lung base with inferior displacement of the major fissure. There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Calcifications are seen within the aorta and right upper lung. Left-sided AICD is present with a lead terminating in the right ventricle. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted. Heterotopic calcification is seen within the right glenohumeral joint.
