Since the prior exam, there is no significant change. An endotracheal tube is present approximately 3.6 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube is in place with the tip in the stomach. A side port is near the gastroesophageal junction. Again, there are bilateral interstitial abnormalities, likely due to mild pulmonary edema. It is not significantly changed from the prior exam. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present. There is no new consolidation. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
