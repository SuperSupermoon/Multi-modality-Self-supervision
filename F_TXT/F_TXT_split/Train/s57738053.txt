Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. Tip of the endotracheal tube resides 3.6 cm above the carina. There is retrocardiac linear density likely reflective of left lower lobe atelectasis. The lungs appear otherwise clear, though lung volumes are low. Prominence of the pulmonary hila likely reflects bronchovascular crowding. The heart size is normal. No supine evidence for pneumothorax or effusion. Bony structures appear intact.
