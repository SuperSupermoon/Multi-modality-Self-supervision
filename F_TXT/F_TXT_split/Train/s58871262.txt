In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been an increase in the degree of pneumothorax bilaterally, slightly more prominent on the left. The subcutaneous gas in the supraclavicular regions bilaterally appears to be increasing. There also may be mediastinal gas in the lower neck. Diffuse bilateral changes in the underlying lungs are essentially unchanged.
