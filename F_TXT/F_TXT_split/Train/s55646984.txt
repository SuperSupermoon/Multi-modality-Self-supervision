A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an esophageal stent, mediastinal clips, and sternal wires, all unchanged in position. A right PICC terminates in the mid SVC, unchanged in position. A second stent projects over the neoesophagus and right main bronchus at an oblique angle, also unchanged compared to ___ but unclear in position. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and the lungs well-aerated, without focal consolidation or pneumothorax. A right pleural abnormality is unchanged, either effusion or scarring. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
