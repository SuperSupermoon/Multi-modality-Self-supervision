AP chest compared to ___, ___:01 p.m.: Endotracheal tube has been re-positioned, tip now 2.5 cm above carina in standard placement. New intra-aortic balloon pump ends at the level of the upper margin of the left main bronchus, also standard placement. An upper enteric drainage tube ends in a non-distended stomach. The heart is not enlarged, suggesting that pulmonary edema is not due to left ventricular dilatation and could be non-cardiac, i.e., diffuse alveolar damage, or a restrictive cardiomyopathy. Small lucent areas have appeared in the lungs suggesting interstitial pulmonary emphysema rather than improvement in the severity of diffuse alveolar filling. Multiple vascular clips and resected posterior right middle rib attest to previous surgery, which should be investigated. Dr. ___ was paged, at 9:55 a.m. when the findings were recognized.
