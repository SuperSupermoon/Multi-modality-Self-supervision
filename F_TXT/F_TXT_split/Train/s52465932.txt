Compared to the most recent prior examination done at 07:14, an enteric tube and endotracheal tube are stable in position. There is improved aeration in the mid and upper right lung status post bronchoscopy. Residual multifocal opacities are likely a combination of multifocal pneumonia an atelectasis with adjacent moderate, multiloculated right pleural effusion. A left retrocardiac opacity is slightly improved. There is no pneumothorax.
