Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position allowing for patient position. The diameter of the cuff exceeds the diameter of the native trachea. Nasogastric tube follows the expected course with the side port below the diaphragm, but the tip is out of view. Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. Retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms is likely atelectasis. Left pleural effusion is small, if any. Linear atelectasis in the right midlung is new. Large vascular hila are exaggerated by patient position. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
