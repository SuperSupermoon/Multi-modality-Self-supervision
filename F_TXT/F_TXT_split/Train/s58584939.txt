An endotracheal tube has been placed that terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube has been placed that terminates immediately above the stomach, probably in the distal esophagus. A left-sided PICC line remains in place, but with a turn and its tip projecting upward, likely terminating in the azygous vein. There are increasing moderate to large pleural effusions, particularly prominent on the right, as well as considerable worsening of hazy pulmonary opacification with an interstitial abnormality most suggestive of pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
