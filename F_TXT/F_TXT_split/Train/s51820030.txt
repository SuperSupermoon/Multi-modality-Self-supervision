Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed. An endotracheal tube ends within 1 cm of the carina, and if pulled back 2 cm, would end in the proper location. Very low lung volumes exaggerate mild pulmonary edema and normal size of cardiomediastinal silhouette, and reflect severe bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
