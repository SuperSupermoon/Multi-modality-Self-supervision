Comparison is made to the prior study from ___. There is a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the distal SVC. There is a right IJ Cordis with distal lead tip in the proximal SVC. Endotracheal tube tip is 3.8 cm above the carina. There is a nasogastric tube and a Dobbhoff tube whose tip and side port are below the gastroesophageal junction. The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion and left retrocardiac opacity. There is atelectasis at the lung bases. There is some improved aeration and improvement of the mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothoraces are seen.
