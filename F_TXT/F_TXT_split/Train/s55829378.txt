Evaluation is limited due to artifact from the underlying trauma board. Within this limitation, an endotracheal tube is seen with the tip terminating just above the thoracic inlet. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip terminating in the right upper quadrant within the stomach. The inspiratory lung volumes are low with streaky opacities at the bilateral bases, reflecting atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. No acute osseous injury is identified.
