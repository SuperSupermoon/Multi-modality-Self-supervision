Portable upright chest x-ray is somewhat oblique in positioning accounting for differences in cardiac contour compared to prior study from ___. Even accounting for this, the cardiac silhouette is large. Central pulmonary vasculature appears mildly full on the right, but is obscured on the left because of patient obliquity. Small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded and there is obscuration of left hemidiaphragm related to some combination of small effusion and/or subsegmental retrocardiac atelectasis.
