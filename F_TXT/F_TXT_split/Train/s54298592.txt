Compared to chest radiograph ___, read in conjunction with chest CTA ___. Previous collapse of the right upper lobe has substantially improved. Heterogeneous opacification in the upper lobe could be residual atelectasis and/or re-expansion edema but should be followed to distinguish these from possible pulmonary hemorrhage. Small right pleural effusion stable. No pneumothorax. Left lung shows borderline pulmonary edema. Heart size is normal. ET tube in standard placement. Esophageal drainage tube traverses a long stent in the mid and lower esophagus. Transvenous right atrial and ventricular pacer leads are continuous from the left pectoral generator.
