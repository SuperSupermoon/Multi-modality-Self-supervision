AP chest compared to ___, 1:50 p.m. New generalized interstitial abnormality has developed, either edema or widespread atypical infection. The patient is badly rotated for this image, but I do not believe the heart has much enlarged nor is the mediastinal vasculature engorged. No appreciable pleural effusion. Tracheostomy tube in place. Dr. ___ was paged at 10:40 a.m. when the findings were recognized.
