As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight improvement with an increase in lung volumes and a subsequent decreased in severity of the pre-existing left perihilar and right apical parenchymal opacity. This increase, however, could also be due to increased ventilatory pressure. The large cavitary lesion at the right lung bases is unchanged in appearance. Also unchanged is the moderate right pleural effusion. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant. Constant monitoring and support devices.
