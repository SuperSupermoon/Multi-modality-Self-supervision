As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased, leading to exaggeration of the pre-existing mild parenchymal opacities. However, the presence of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema cannot be excluded, notably given the presence of moderate cardiomegaly. At the level of the middle trachea, post-surgical material is in situ. No evidence of other large airway changes. No pleural effusions. Unchanged course of the right subclavian catheter.
