In comparison with study of ___, there again are patchy areas of increased opacification in the left mid and upper lung zones as well as in the right mid and lower lung. This could reflect multifocal aspiration or pneumonia, though some element of asymmetric pulmonary edema may be present. Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. There may well be a small left effusion as well.
