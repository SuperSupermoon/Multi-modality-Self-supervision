AP chest compared to ___: Pulmonary edema has changed in distribution but not in overall severity. New consolidation at the lung bases is probably a combination of dependent edema and atelectasis, though aspiration could be playing a role. Small left pleural effusion is new. Moderate enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 57 mm from the carina, with the chin elevated. This is standard positioning. An upper enteric drainage tube ends in the non-distended stomach and an ascending temporary pacer lead projects over the cavity of the right ventricle. No pneumothorax.
