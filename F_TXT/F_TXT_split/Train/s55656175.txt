There is an NG tube seen with distal tip projecting over the mid mediastinum, side port at the level of the clavicles. This was discussed over the phone with the surgical team at the time of radiograph review. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is improvement in previously visualized right base/cardiophrenic opacity. There is stable left lower lung atelectasis, obscuring the left hemidiaphragm. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. There may be minimal bilateral pleural effusions.
