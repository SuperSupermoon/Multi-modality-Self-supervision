The lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation. Hazy opacification of the left base is likely atelectasis. There is no focal airspace opacity, small pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are somewhat wide, though likely post-surgical after a prior CABG. The heart size is normal. Sternal wires are intact. Mediastinal clips are noted.
