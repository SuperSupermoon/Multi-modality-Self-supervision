There is a large right and small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. Extension of the right pleural abnormality over the apex of the lung could be due to pleural thickening, in addition to the effusion. Left basilar interstitial markings may reflect edema. The lungs are hyperinflated, and there is no focal consolidation. The heart size is normal.
