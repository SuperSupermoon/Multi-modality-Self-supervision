Following removal of a right-sided chest tube, there is no visible right pneumothorax. Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. Other indwelling devices remain in standard position. Airspace opacities have developed in the left perihilar and basilar regions and could reflect asymmetrical edema or other process such as aspiration. Moderate left pleural effusion has increased in size. Right basilar atelectasis has worsened and is accompanied by increasing small right pleural effusion.
