Compared with 1 day earlier, the overall appearance is similar. Again seen is a left chest wall pacer, with lead tips over the right ventricle. Also again seen is cardiomegaly and hyperinflation. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora. There is bibasilar atelectasis, similar to the prior film, without frank consolidation. No gross effusion.
