The lungs are well expanded. Scattered pulmonary calcifications are unchanged and likely represent prior granulomatous infection. No focal opacities are noted. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Blunting of the aortopulmonary window is unchanged from prior exam and may be related to positioning. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
