Study is limited due to low inspiratory lung volumes and patient rotation. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Low lung volumes accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely borderline enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob are present. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is noted. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality seen. Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joint are noted.
