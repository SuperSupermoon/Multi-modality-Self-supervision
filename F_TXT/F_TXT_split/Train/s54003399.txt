As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimally improved ventilation, notably at the lung bases. The moderate cardiomegaly with left retrocardiac atelectasis and right basal areas of atelectasis, however, persists. The presence of small pleural effusions cannot be excluded, but there is currently no evidence of overt pulmonary edema. Unchanged appearance of the hilar and mediastinal regions. The previously seen nasogastric tube has been removed, the left subclavian catheter is unchanged.
