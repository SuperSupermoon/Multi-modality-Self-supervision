As compared to the previous radiograph, the single right and left chest tube remain in situ, as is the right PICC line. All other monitoring and support devices have been removed. The image shows no evidence of pneumothorax. The lung volumes are low and lateral areas of basal atelectasis are seen. Mild cardiomegaly without evidence of overt pulmonary edema. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
