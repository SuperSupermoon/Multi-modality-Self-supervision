In comparison with the study of ___, thoracic fusion procedure has been performed with metallic devices in place and skin sutures in position. The precise position of the endotracheal tube is somewhat difficult to see, though it appears to be about 4 cm above the carina. Complete opacification of the left hemithorax and Port-A-Cath are again seen. The right lung is essentially clear. What appears to be some external device is mimicking the appearance of a right pneumothorax.
