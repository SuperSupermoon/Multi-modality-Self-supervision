AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding supine portable chest examination of ___. The patient remains intubated, the ETT is terminating in the trachea 3 cm above the level of the carina. Previously described right-sided internal jugular approach central venous line as well as left-sided internal jugular line remain in unchanged position. The pulmonary vascular congestive pattern with marked perivascular haze bilaterally persists. Haze over the basal portion of the left hemithorax suggestive of some pleural effusion layering in the posterior compartments but cannot be demonstrated conclusively on single chest examination. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
