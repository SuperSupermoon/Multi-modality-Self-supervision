Single upright portable view of the chest demonstrates relatively low lung volumes, with mild prominence of the hilar structures and perihilar interstitial markings, compatible with mild pulmonary edema. A small left pleural effusion is noted, along with mild biapical pleural thickening. There is no pneumothorax. No focal airspace opacity is detected. The heart is mildly enlarged. Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted.
