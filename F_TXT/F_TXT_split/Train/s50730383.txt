Since the prior CXR, there has been interval placement of an enteric tube that terminates in the stomach, but the sidehole is at the GE junction. Endotracheal tube terminates 5.5 cm above the carina. The right sided PICC line has been advanced and now terminates in the mid right atrium. There has been interval worsening of the right layering pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. No left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinum appears widened, likely due to patient rotation. Cervical fusion device is unchanged in location.
