In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, various support and monitoring devices have been removed with residual Swan-Ganz catheter in place. Small to moderate right apical pneumothorax was probably present in retrospect on the previous radiograph but more difficult to detect due to supine positioning of the patient on the prior study. Tiny left apical pneumothorax is new following removal of left chest tube. Exam is otherwise remarkable for pulmonary vascular congestion, worsening bibasilar atelectasis, and probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
