Heart size is normal. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is re- demonstrated, better seen on the recent CT. Bilateral hilar enlargement is also compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy. There is no pulmonary edema. Patchy and linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. Small right pleural effusion persists. There is no pneumothorax.
