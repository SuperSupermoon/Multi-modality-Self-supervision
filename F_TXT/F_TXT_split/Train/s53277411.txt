Very small residual left apical pneumothorax is similar to the prior study. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Widespread pulmonary nodules are unchanged. Moderate left pleural effusion has slightly increased in size, but adjacent left retrocardiac opacity has slightly improved. Widespread pulmonary nodules appear similar. Small right pleural effusion is not appreciably changed.
