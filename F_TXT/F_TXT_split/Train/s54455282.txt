In comparison with study of ___, the left subclavian catheter has been removed. The tracheostomy tube and right subclavian catheters remain in good position. Continued low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart in this patient with moderate pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Probable bilateral small pleural effusions.
