A curvilinear lucency paralleling the expected location of the right hemidiaphragm has slightly decreased in the interval and may reflect improving pneumoperitoneum. Moderate right pleural effusion persists with adjacent atelectasis involving right middle and right lower lobe, not appreciably changed. There is no visible apical pneumothorax. Patchy and linear atelectasis at the left base has slightly worsened, but a small left pleural effusion is not substantially changed.
