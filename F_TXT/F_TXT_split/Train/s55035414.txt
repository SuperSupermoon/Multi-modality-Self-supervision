Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged from ___. Mild, stable widening of the mediastinum is likely attributable to mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta along with post-CABG changes. A left anterior chest wall AICD remains in place with unchanged lead positioning. A large-bore right internal jugular central venous catheter remains unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the high right atrium. Prominence and slight indistinctness of the central pulmonary vasculature is suggestive of fluid overload with mild interstitial edema. Bibasilar atelectasis is small. Lungs are otherwise clear. The pleural surfaces are clear without large effusion or pneumothorax.
