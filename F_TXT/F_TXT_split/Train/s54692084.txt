As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the endotracheal tube is not substantially changed. The tube projects 5 cm above the carina. Also unchanged is the course of the nasogastric tube, the position of the right subclavian vein catheter. The patient continues to display bilateral pleural effusions and areas of bilateral basal atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema might also be present. However, there is no evidence for a newly occurred parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
