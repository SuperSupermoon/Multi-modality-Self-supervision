Comparison is made with prior study performed 7 hours earlier. Increasing opacity in the left lung. This could be due to increasing consolidations, pleural effusions or most likely large areas of atelectasis. There is no evident pneumothorax. Left PICC tip is again visualized in the left axillary vein. Diffuse right lung opacities are grossly unchanged. There is better aeration in the right lung due to change in atelectasis due to redistribution of pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be evaluated. Findings were discussed by phone with Dr. ___ at the time of discovery of the finding at 2:12 p.m. on ___
