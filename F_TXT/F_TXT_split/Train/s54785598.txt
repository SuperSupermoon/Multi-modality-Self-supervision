Previously densely consolidated left upper lobe has collapsed. Left lower lobe is substantially consolidated at the base. The volume of accompanying left pleural effusion is hard to assess. Only mild edema persists in the right Lung. Region of severe scarring at the right apex is most likely due to previous tuberculosis or radiation. ECMO cannula extends from the abdominal vena cava through the right atrium to the mid SVC. An ascending Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the pulmonary outflow tract, not the pulmonary artery. ET tube is in standard placement. Nasogastric drainage tube ends in nondistended stomach. No pneumothorax.
