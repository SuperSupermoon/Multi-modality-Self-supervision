Bilateral chest tubes are directed superiorly. An endotracheal tube is 8 cm above the carina and should be advanced for proper positioning. Enteric tube terminates within the stomach. A right subclavian catheter terminates in the upper SVC. There is a small right apical pneumothorax and probable small left pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion. There is collapse of the left lower lobe. Capping of the left apex may represent pleural fluid or extrapleural hematoma. Multiple right rib fractures and bilateral scapular fractures are better seen on the trauma CT torso.
