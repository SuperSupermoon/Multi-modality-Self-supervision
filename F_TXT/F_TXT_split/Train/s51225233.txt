Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Lungs are essentially clear. The only abnormality in the lungs are linear opacities in the right lower lobe that most likely represent atelectasis due to suboptimal lung inspiratory effort. No definitive evidence of infection demonstrated but attention to this area on the subsequent study is recommended. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
