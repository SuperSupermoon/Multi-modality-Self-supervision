The patient is substantially rotated. The newly placed NG tube can be traced to the level of the GE junction. A left PICC line terminates in the mid SVC, unchanged. The chin and overlying soft tissues obscures the left lung apex. The differential opacification of the right hemithorax relative to the left may be positional. There is no new consolidation or pleural effusion. The heart mediastinum are within normal limits despite the projection. No right pneumothorax is present.
