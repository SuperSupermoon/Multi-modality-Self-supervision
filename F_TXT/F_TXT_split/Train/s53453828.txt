Compared with the prior radiograph, there has been little change in the overall appearance. A large right and smaller left pleural effusion are identified, both of underlying atelectasis or consolidation. The right PICC line tip projects over the mid SVC. No pneumothorax detected. A catheter or other tubing overlying the upper abdomen is partially imaged; it is unclear if this is internal or external to the patient.
