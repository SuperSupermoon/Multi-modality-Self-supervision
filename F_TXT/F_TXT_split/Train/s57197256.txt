As compared to the previous radiograph, the right lung has minimally increased in transparency, reflecting either a true improvement or an increase in ventilatory pressure. On the left, pre-existing parenchymal opacities have slightly increased in extent and severity. No larger pleural effusions. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. The monitoring and support devices are constant. The tip of the endotracheal tube is still slightly too high and should be advanced by 1-2 cm.
