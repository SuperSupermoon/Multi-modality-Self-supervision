A moderate right pneumothorax is obscured by heavy subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall extending into the neck and axilla; the mediastinum is not shifted, despite presumed postive pressure ventilation from an endotracheal tube ending 2 cm above the carina. An esophageal tube ends at the gastroesophageal junction and would need to be advanced at least 12cm to move all the sideports into the stomach that is currently massively distended with air, quite likely interfering with expansion of the chest. Both lungs are densely consolidated, the right lung diffusely and the left predominantly at the base; contributions from atelectasis, aspiration, edemas, and even hemorrhage, cannot be assigne. Cardiomegaly is mild to moderate. The mediastinum is not appreciably widened. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not appreciable.
