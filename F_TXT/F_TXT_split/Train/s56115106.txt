AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: ET tube ends in standard position, 3.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube passes into the mid portion of non-distended stomach. Heart is top normal size. I see no central venous catheter. There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. Heart size is top normal. Aside from minimal atelectasis at the base of the left lung, lungs are clear.
