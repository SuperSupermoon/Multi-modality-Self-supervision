1. Endotracheal tube, right subclavian PICC line and feeding tube are unchanged in position, although the tip of the feeding tube is not included on the study. A right brachiocephalic venous stent remains in place. The patient is status post median sternotomy with valve replacement and the cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There has been interval improvement in appearance of the interstitium, suggesting a resolving component of edema. There is retrocardiac opacity and more focal patchy opacity at the right medial lung base, both of which could reflect areas of atelectasis, although an infectious process should also be considered. No evidence of pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-supine technique.
