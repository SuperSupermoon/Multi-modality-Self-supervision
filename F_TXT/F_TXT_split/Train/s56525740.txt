The patient has undergone thoracocentesis. The pre-existing small pleural effusion on the right is improved. No evidence of pneumothorax. Improved ventilation of the right lung base. The large right central mass is unchanged in extent but the surrounding parenchymal opacities appear to have decreased in size. A previously positioned pericardial drain has been removed. No new focal parenchymal opacities.
