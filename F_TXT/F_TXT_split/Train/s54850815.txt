No safe evidence of free intra-abdominal air. A nasogastric tube has been placed, the tube shows a normal course, the tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach. Both lung bases show several diaphragmatic opacities. The symmetry of these changes favors atelectasis over pneumonia, but a repeat radiograph should be performed within 24 hours to exclude early pneumonia. No safe evidence of pleural effusion. No pulmonary edema. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
