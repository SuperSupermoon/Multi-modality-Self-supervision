Vascular congestion and borderline edema are new, particularly in the right lung severely compressed by the marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Cardiomegaly is mild. Pleural effusions are small if any. Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC. Very poor definition of the right bronchial tree raises possibility of impacted secretions. Clinical correlation advised.
