Single AP portable chest radiograph was obtained. Since the most recent prior radiograph, there is slight improvement in diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, particularly on the left. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion which is mostly unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Right PICC tip is unchanged.
