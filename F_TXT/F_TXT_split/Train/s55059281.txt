Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube is in a standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. There is no pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacities have minimally increased consistent with increasing atelectasis and effusion. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is minimally improved. Atelectasis in the right base and right effusion are unchanged.
