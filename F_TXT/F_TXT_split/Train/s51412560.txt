There are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen. There is opacity at the medial right lung base which may represent confluence of vascular structures, but underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude. There is slight blunting of the costophrenic angles particularly on the right and a trace pleural effusion is also difficult to exclude. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
