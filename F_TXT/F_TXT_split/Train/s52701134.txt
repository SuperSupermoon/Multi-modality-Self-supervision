Lung volumes are low. Again noted are diffuse, bilateral, coarse, interstitial opacities overall not significantly changed compared to the prior examination. However, there is increased opacification over lateral left lower lung, possibly parenchymal or related to tracking pleural effusion. Possible trace right pleural effusion. The heart is not well evaluated given the overall parenchymal opacification. Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are grossly unchanged. Multiple bilateral rib deformities are not essentially unchanged.
