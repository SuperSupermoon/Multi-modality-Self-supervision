As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The massive cardiomegaly and the right pleural effusion with subsequent collapse of the right lower lung parts are constant. Also constant is the relatively large left lower lobe atelectasis. The other lung areas show normal ventilation. No fluid overload. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
