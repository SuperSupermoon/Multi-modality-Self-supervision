Single AP view of the chest provided. An ET tube ends 2.0 cm above the Carina. An orogastric tube extends below the level of the diaphragm, the distal tip is not visualized. A left PICC ends at the distal SVC. Retrocardiac and left basilar consolidation is unchanged. There is suggestion of a mild leftward shift of mediastinal structures, however this may be due to rotation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Hilar contours are normal.
