Supine portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The aorta is tortuous. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation. The endotracheal tube ends 5.2 cm from the carina. The orogastric tube courses into the stomach with the last side port at the GE junction. Multiple old left-sided rib fractures are present.
