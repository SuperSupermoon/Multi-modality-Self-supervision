Portable semi-upright radiograph is obtained. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been removed. New pulmonary opacities are seen in the bases bilaterally with accompanying small right pleural effusion. In the setting of a seizure history, these findings could reflect aspiration, though pneumonia in the appropriate setting is an alternative explanation. Heart is normal. No pneumothorax is seen.
