There has been interval placement of an ET tube in satisfactory position. A right PICC line is present with the tip in the mid SVC. There is new left lower lobe consolidation which is consistent with collapse. There is no leftward shift of mediastinal structures, indicating hyperinflation of the left upper lobe. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion. Right-sided atelectasis has improved. Heart size is top normal.
