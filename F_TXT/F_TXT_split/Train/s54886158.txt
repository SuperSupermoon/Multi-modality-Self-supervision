Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Heart size is top normal and there is mildly increased widening of the mediastinum. Small opacity in the left lung base is new, could be scar or nodule, less likely infection. Prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings is consistent with vascular congestion. No substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
