Single portable upright frontal chest radiograph was provided. Diffuse bilateral perihilar opacification with cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature is consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions are also noted. Heart is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Calcifications are noted in the aortic arch. EKG leads project over the upper chest. Bony structures are grossly intact.
