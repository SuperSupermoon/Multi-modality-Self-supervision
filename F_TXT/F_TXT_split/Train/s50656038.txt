Slight asymmetric lucency overlying the right lung base with a deep sulcus sign likely reflects the small right pneumothorax seen on CT and appears similar compared to the previous chest radiograph. Lung volumes remain low with patchy opacities in the lung bases, compatible with atelectasis on the left and contusion with atelectasis on the right. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. No evidence of mediastinal shift. There is no pulmonary edema. Multiple right-sided rib fractures are better assessed on the recent CT. Right humeral head remains anteriorly dislocated and a right scapular fracture is incompletely imaged.
