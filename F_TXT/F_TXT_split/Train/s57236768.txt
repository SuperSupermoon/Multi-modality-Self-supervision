Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a pleural drainage catheter on the left. There is a small persistent left apical pneumothorax, with some pleural effusion tracking along the left apex. Left basilar pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis appears unchanged. The right lung is grossly clear.
