The lungs are hyperinflated, compatible with chronic lung disease. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. Scarring/chronic atelectasis at the left lung base is unchanged. The heart is normal size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. A left pectoral pacemaker, sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are constant. Chronic appearing right-sided rib fractures are noted.
