An endotracheal tube is seen. The carina is difficult to delineate but the tip is likely approximately 3 cm from the carina. Left-sided subclavian line is seen coiled over the upper mediastinum. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with distal tip not well visualized. The patient is rotated and lung volumes are low. No pneumothorax or effusion is noted on this supine film. The mediastinum appears wide although this may be due to AP technique and low lung volumes, the possibility of underlying abnormality such as hematoma should be considered. There is increased density in the paramediastinal regions as well, potentially due to atelectasis.
