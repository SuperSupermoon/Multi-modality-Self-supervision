Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates slight improvement in pulmonary edema following extubation, which may indicate increased cardiac function. If present, pleural effusions are small in size. Mediastinal contour is wide, but unchanged, and this is likely due in part to distention of mediastinal vessels. The right internal jugular central venous line is seen with the tip ending at the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
