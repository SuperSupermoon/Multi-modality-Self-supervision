There is diffuse prominence of the pulmonary interstitium, unchanged from prior studies compatible with chronic lung disease. There is no obvious superimposed pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is detected. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with prominence of the tortuous thoracic aorta. Calcification of the aortic knob is again seen.
