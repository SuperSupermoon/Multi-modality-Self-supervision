A single semi-upright frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. There is no free air under the diaphragm. Gaseous distention of large bowel is incompletely imaged on this study. Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. Linear opacity at the right lung base corresponds to scarring seen on CT. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous.
