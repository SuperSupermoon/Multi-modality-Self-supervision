Lungs appear well inflated. There is a faint opacity at the left base which is concerning for early pneumonia or aspiration. In addition, the left hilar region appears somewhat prominent, although this could reflect prominent vascular structures given the portable lordotic technique on this study. Clinical correlation and followup imaging with PA and lateral views is recommended. No evidence of pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or pleural effusions. Overall cardiac contour is within normal limits of size given portable technique.
