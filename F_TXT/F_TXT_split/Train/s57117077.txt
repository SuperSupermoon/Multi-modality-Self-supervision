A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest wall pacer device with a lead overlying the right ventricle, PA catheter terminating in the main pulmonary artery, VAD, endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, and enteric tube coursing below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image. There has been interval removal of a right/mediastinal chest tube, with development of a small right apical pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is unchanged, as is retrocardiac opacity. No new focal consolidation is identified. A small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
