Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. The right middle and lower lobes are nearly completely re-expanded.

Left lower lobe atelectasis has increased and a small left pleural effusion is likely unchanged. Median sternotomy wires and spinal fusion hardware are again noted. Probable left breast implant is also noted.
