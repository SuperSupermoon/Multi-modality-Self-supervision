The left internal jugular central venous catheter tip appears to terminate in the region of the proximal right subclavian vein. Lung volumes are reduced compared to the previous exam. There is now interval development of mild pulmonary vascular congestion with a new vague opacity in the periphery of the mild right mid lung field. Bibasilar airspace opacities persist, likely reflecting worsening atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. No large pleural effusion is demonstrated.
