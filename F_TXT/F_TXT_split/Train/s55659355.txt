Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiac size is normal, accentuated by the low lung volumes and mediastinal fat as seen in prior CT. Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side have worsened, on the left consistent with atelectases with almost collapse of the left lower lobe. There are no new abnormalities. Perihilar opacities larger on the left side have minimally improved. Right upper lobe medial opacity is unchanged consistent with atelectasis. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard positions. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
