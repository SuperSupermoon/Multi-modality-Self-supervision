A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates stable low lung volumes as well as marked bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. Although there are persistent findings consistent with hypervolemia, such as marked dilation of the azygos vein, the mild interstitial pulmonary edema seen on the prior radiograph has improved somewhat. Clearance of the edema has revealed heterogeneous opacities in the left upper lobe which may also be due to atelectasis, however, other causes such as underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is possibly a small effusion on the left, if any. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. An endotracheal tube terminates no less than 4.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach.
