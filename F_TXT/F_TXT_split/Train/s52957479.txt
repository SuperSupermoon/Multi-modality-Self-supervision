Comparison is made to the previous study from ___. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 7 cm above the carina at the level of the clavicular heads. There is a right-sided subclavian catheter with distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. There is a right IJ line with distal lead tip at the distal SVC. There is a feeding tube whose distal tip is below the GE junction appropriately sited. A nasogastric tube tip and side port are below the GE junction. Heart size is within normal limits. There is subcutaneous gas seen within the soft tissues of the lower neck bilaterally, stable. Lungs are grossly clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or signs for overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothoraces are identified.
