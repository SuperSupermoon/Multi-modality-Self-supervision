AP chest compared to ___: Small midline left pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum persists. Other pleural surfaces are apposed, following repositioning of the left pleural tube to a lateral costal position. Lung volumes are considerably lower today exaggerating any differences in the lungs, but there does appear to be extensive atelectasis or asymmetrically distributed edema. Moderate right pleural effusion is larger. Mediastinal vascular engorgement suggests increased central venous pressure and/or volume. ET tube is in standard position. Right PIC or subclavian line ends in the upper right atrium and would need to be withdrawn 3 cm to place it low in the SVC. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. ET tube in standard placement.
