Worsening pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by new, mild pulmonary edema. Substantial right middle and lower lobe atelectasis persists. Chronic cardiomegaly is severe. Tip of the newly placed endotracheal tube is less than 2 cm from the carina with the chin in neutral or elevation. It should be withdrawn 2 cm to avoid inadvertent unilateral intubation. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. Pleural effusion, if any, is not large. No pneumothorax.
