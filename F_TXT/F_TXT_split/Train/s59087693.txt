A right IJ PA line is in place. The tip overlies the distal right PA artery, possibly at the origin of the inferior lobe branch. It is retracted slightly compared with ___ at 19:10 p.m., but remains relatively distal. Right-sided PICC line is present. The tip is obscured, but it overlies the distal SVC. A left-sided AICD device is present, with lead tip over right ventricle. Again seen is cardiomegaly, with prominence of the right heart border, similar to the prior film. There is upper zone redistribution and possible minimal vascular plethora, but no overt CHF. Possible slight retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged. No focal infiltrate or gross effusion is identified. No pneumothorax detected. Right IJ PA line tip overlying the distal right pulmonary artery.
