No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there is tortuosity of the descending aorta. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Left basilar atelectatic changes are seen. No evidence of pneumothorax. In the absence of a true upright view, it is difficult to unequivocally exclude free intraperitoneal gas. Sternal sutures are seen at the clavicular level.
