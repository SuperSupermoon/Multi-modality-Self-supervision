A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends 2.4 cm above the carina. Bibasilar opacities are atelectasis on subsequent chest CT. Widening of the mediastinum is due to mediastinal lipomatosis on subsequent CT. The nasogastric tube within the esophagus is displaced to the right, ending in the stomach, with the side port at the gastroesophageal junction. There is no effusion or large pneumothorax.
