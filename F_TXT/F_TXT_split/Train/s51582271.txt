As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. A pre-existing opacity at the left lung base has decreased in extent and severity. Minimal bilateral pleural effusions could be present. There is crowding of the vascular structures at the lung bases, but the presence of minimal fluid overload cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. Minimal cardiomegaly.
