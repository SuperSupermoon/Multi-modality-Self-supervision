In comparison with the previous study of ___, nasogastric tube has been pushed forward with the tip in the mid body of the stomach. The side port is probably just distal to the esophagogastric junction. There is some increased opacification at the bases with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms, especially on the left. This is consistent with volume loss in the lower lungs and pleural effusion. There is indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The endotracheal tube and right IJ catheter remain in good position.
