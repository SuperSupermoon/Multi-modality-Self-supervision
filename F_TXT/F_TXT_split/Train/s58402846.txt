AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. The heart size appears to have increased mildly but difficulties with assessing precise heart volume on single view portable chest examination must be underlined. Comparison of the pulmonary vasculature suggests increased diameter of the central pulmonary vessel consistent with fluid plethora. However, no conclusive signs for interstitial or alveolar edema, and the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. No pneumothorax in the apical area, and no evidence of new discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates. The described changes in heart size and pulmonary vasculature could be related to high degree of fluid administration, but there is no evidence of advanced cardiac failure. An NG tube has been placed during the examination interval and is seen to reach well below the diaphragm including its side port.
