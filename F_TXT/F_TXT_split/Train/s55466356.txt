Lung volumes are slightly lower than on the prior study. There continues to be pulmonary vascular redistribution and obscuration of both hemidiaphragms. This can be due to volume loss/effusion/infiltrate. Tracheostomy tube and right IJ line are unchanged. Compared to the prior study, the appearance of the lungs is slightly worse.
