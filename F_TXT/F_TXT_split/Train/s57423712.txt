The ET tube is approximately 1 cm from the carina and should be repositioned. Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of bronchovascular markings, but no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Opacification in the right upper lobe likely represents atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette appears accentuated by low lung volumes.
