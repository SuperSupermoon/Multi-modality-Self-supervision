New tracheostomy is midline. The approximate diameter of the tube, 11 mm, compares to the diameter of the trachea, 27 mm. This sizing should be evaluated clinically. Pneumomediastinum outlines the tracheal wall and extends into deep subcutaneous emphysema in the neck, presumably a function of tracheostomy. Followup advised. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Lungs are clear. Heart size is normal.
