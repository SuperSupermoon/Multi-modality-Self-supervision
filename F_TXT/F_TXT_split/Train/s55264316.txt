AP chest compared to ___ at 11:07 a.m.: Endotracheal tube is still at the carina and should be withdrawn 3 cm for optimal position. Mild pulmonary edema has improved in the left lung, small left pleural effusion is new. Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is stable and obscures the right lung which is at least atelectatic, if not consolidated at the base. Heart is probably still mildly enlarged, though patient rotation changes its configuration. Right subclavian or PIC line ends at the junction of brachiocephalic veins. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
