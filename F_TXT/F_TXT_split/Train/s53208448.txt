Supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. However, given this, no focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Minimal prominence of the pulmonary vasculature may be due to mild vascular congestion. No displaced fracture is seen. Partially imaged is the right humeral prosthesis.
