Single frontal portable view of the chest was obtained. The heart is of top normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours. The pulmonary vasculature is slightly prominent, compatible with mild pulmonary congestion. The lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Osseous structures appear unremarkable. A metallic stent overlies the right upper quadrant.
