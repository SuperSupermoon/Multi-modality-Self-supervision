Endotracheal tube terminates 4.6 cm above the carina with the cuff appearing overinflated. There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema throughout the chest, including outlining the pectoralis muscles and within the neck. A small pneumothorax is seen at the base of the right lung. Linear density along the lateral aspect of the right lung represents an underlying skin fold. The cardiac silhouette is normal. There is pneumomediastinum. Coarse interstitial pulmonary markings are noted diffusely, with bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests a trace effusion. Lungs are hyperinflated likely due to underlying COPD. Cardiac silhouette size is normal and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
