As compared to ___ radiograph, left internal jugular and right internal jugular catheters terminate in the proximal superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by interstitial edema and a new small right pleural effusion. Worsening left retrocardiac opacity is likely a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.
