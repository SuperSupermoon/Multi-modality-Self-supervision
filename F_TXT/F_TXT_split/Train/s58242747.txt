As compared to the previous radiograph, a new Dobbhoff has been placed. The course of the new tube is unremarkable, the tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The pleural effusions, low lung volumes and areas of atelectasis as well as the extent of the cardiomegaly is unchanged.
