Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The heart is of normal size. An endotracheal tube terminates in the proximal right main stem bronchus. The left lower lobe is collapsed, likely related to endotracheal tube position. There is small atelectasis of the right lower lobe. Bilateral pleural effusions are seen. No pneumothorax. NG tube terminates below the diaphragm. Calcified densities overlying the left upper quadrant may represent staghorn calculi. Irregularity of the left chest wall osseous structures may represent prior trauma or surgery.
