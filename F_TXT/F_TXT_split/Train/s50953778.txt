Tracheostomy tube and nasogastric tube remain in place. Side port of nasogastric tube is at or just proximal to the expected location of the GE junction and could be advanced a few centimeters for standard positioning. Feeding tube terminates below the diaphragm with tip beyond the field of view. Extensive bilateral calcified pleural plaques are again demonstrated, in keeping with prior asbestos exposure. Bibasilar lung opacities appear similar to the recent chest radiograph, and remain partially obscured by the adjacent pleural disease. Small pleural effusions appear similar to the prior radiograph.
