An endotracheal terminates 5.7 cm above the carina. An enteric tube terminates over the left upper quadrant, likely within the stomach. A chest tube on the left is unchanged. A left internal jugular catheter terminates in the brachiocephalic SVC junction and has its tip oriented. Lung volumes are somewhat low, which accentuates bronchovascular markings. There is no focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. A small triangular opacity projected over the left lung base suggests atelectasis.
