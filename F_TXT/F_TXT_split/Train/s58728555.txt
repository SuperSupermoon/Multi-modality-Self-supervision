Lung volumes remain very low, and the opacification at the lung bases is probably vascular crowding and mild atelectasis, but it could mask aspiration and early pneumonia in should be followed. Pulmonary vascular engorgement has improved minimally since earlier in the day. I do not see pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion. Heart is mildly enlarged, as before. Right jugular line ends in the right atrium. No pneumothorax
