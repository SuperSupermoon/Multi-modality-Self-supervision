Extensive subcutaneous emphysema throughout the thorax and lower neck is unchanged and limits evaluation of the underlying lung. Within this limitation, a small right apical pneumothorax remains visible. The patient's known pneumomediastinum is not significantly changed from prior studies. Opacification of the right middle lobe is unchanged, reflecting a component of collapse. No large pleural effusion is seen. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.
