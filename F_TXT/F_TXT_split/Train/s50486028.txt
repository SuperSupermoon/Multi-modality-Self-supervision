AP chest compared to ___ at 2:03 a.m.: Tip of the new right internal jugular line projects over the upper SVC. No pneumothorax, pleural effusion or attributable mediastinal widening. Interstitial pulmonary edema has worsened, and therefore the mild widening of the paratracheal mediastinum is most likely due to combination of supine positioning and real distention of mediastinal veins. Right perihilar opacification is the greatest in the right lung and raises concern for concurrent pneumonia or atelectasis and should be reevaluated when feasible. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is more pronounced as well. No pneumothorax.
