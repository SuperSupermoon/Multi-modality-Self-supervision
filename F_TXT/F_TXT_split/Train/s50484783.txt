AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Cardiomegaly is substantial. The patient is rotated and the lucency of the lungs is different and suspicious for right pleural effusion. Repeated radiograph preferably in symmetric position is recommended. Although comparison with prior radiographs is essential. No pneumothorax is seen.
