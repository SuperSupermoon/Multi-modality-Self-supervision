Large mass-like opacity in the left upper lobe has decreased in size and appears slightly more well defined compared to the previous study, now measuring about 7.5 cm and previously measuring about 9.5 cm. Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened and is accompanied by interstitial pulmonary edema. Improved aeration at the lung bases, particularly within the left retrocardiac region, with residual linear atelectasis remaining. Bilateral pleural effusions have improved. Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position.
