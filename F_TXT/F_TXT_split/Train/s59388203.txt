Comparison is made with prior study ___. Severe cardiomegaly is stable. There are lower lung volumes. Sternal wires are aligned. The patient is status post CABG. Moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged. More focal opacities in the right lower lobe are unchanged. As mentioned before, this could be asymmetric edema, atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There are no new lung abnormalities or pneumothorax.
