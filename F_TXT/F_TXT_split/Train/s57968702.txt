There is extensive opacification of the left hemithorax with an air-fluid level identified superiorly. These findings are representative of a large mass, possibly abscess in a fissure. Less likely would be a large hiatal hernia. There is rightward shift of normally midline structures. Otherwise, the right hemithorax appears clear. No acute fractures are identified. A dedicated chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
