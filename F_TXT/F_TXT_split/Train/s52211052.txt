Left PICC tip terminates in the upper SVC. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is moderately enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with crowding of the bronchovascular structures noted. While there may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion, no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present with chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm again noted. Bibasilar atelectasis is present, more pronounced on the right. No pneumothorax is identified.
