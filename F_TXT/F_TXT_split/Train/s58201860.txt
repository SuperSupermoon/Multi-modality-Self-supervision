Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrate two left pleural drains, one terminating at the left lung apex and the other deep within the posterior left costophrenic angle. There is no pneumothorax. There appears to be better aeration bilaterally with persistent bibasilar opacification, probably atelectasis but cannot exclude infection. Normal heart size. The stomach is moderately distended.
