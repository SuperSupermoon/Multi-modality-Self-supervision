Patient has known sternal fracture with retrosternal hematoma and multiple rib fractures. There may be subtle increase in left pleural fluid with fluid also seen at the left apex. There is also subtle increased interstitial markings of the left hemi thorax which could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema. There may also be evolving contusion at the left lung base.
