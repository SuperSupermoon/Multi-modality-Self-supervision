AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study dated ___. During the interval the patient has been extubated. Previously described left subclavian approach central venous line remains in unchanged position. A right internal jugular approach central venous line has apparently been removed. No pneumothorax has developed. The previously identified triangular-shaped atelectasis in the right upper lobe area is resolving. Some hazy densities remain in the area. Heart size is not enlarged and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Previously described diffuse mostly interstitial changes in the left lung which apparently represent the transplant, remain unchanged. No pneumothorax on either side.
