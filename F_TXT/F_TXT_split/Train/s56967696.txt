Small left pneumothorax is probably unchanged since earlier in the day. Heterogeneous consolidation in both lungs is probably unchanged, with some apparent redistribution due to increasing atelectasis, particularly in the right lower lobe. Heart is normal size. Pleural effusions minimal if any. ET tube and right subclavian line and nasogastric drainage tube are in standard placements respectively.
