The radiograph shows a postoperative condition with an endotracheal tube. The tip projects 2 cm above the carina, pulling back by approximately 1-2 cm is recommended. Enteric tube is coiled superior to the diaphragm, with the tip underneath the diaphragm, suggesting the presence of a hiatal hernia. An Ecmo catheter is seen with the tip in the upper SVC. Dual-lead pacemaker is stable. Moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema with stable bilateral pleural effusions and moderate cardiomegaly. The hilar and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
