As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in constant position, with the exception of the Swan-Ganz catheter that shows its tip more peripheral in the right pulmonary artery. The catheter should be pulled back by approximately 4 cm. The lung volumes have slightly decreased. However, the radiodensity of the lung parenchyma is unchanged. Likely presence of a small right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema.
