As compared to the previous radiograph, the pigtail catheter in the left pleural space is in unchanged position. No pleural effusion on the left is visible. On the right, the effusion has unchanged extent and severity. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Substantial right hilar enlargement, signs of mild fluid overload and known pre-existing parenchymal opacities are without change.
