The ET tube terminates approximately 4 cm from the carina. There is a right-sided IJ, which terminates in the upper to mid superior vena cava with no visible pneumothorax. The enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the scope of the view of the film. There has been worsening of the right lower lobe and part of the right middle lobe atelectasis, compared to the study from 1:42am, however stable compared to the most recent exam. Given the distribution, this is concerning for mucus plugging involving the bronchus intermedius. There has been a slight interval increase in the patchy and linear left lower lobe atelectasis at the left base compared to the most recent exam. There is a stable small left pleural effusion. No new focal consolidations are identified. There is no pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is stable at least since ___. The hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
