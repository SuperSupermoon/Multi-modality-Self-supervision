Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contour is similar with diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications noted. Low lung volumes are demonstrated with crowding of the bronchovascular structures and possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Focal opacity in the retrocardiac region is concerning for pneumonia with blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive of a trace left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
