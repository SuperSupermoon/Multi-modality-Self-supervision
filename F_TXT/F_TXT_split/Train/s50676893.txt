1. Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip at the thoracic inlet, approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach and the side port likely just below the gastroesophageal junction. There is worsening bibasilar and left mid lung airspace process which is concerning for pneumonia or aspiration. An unusual distribution of pulmonary edema would be much less likely as there is no evidence of a peribronchial cuffing at least in the right upper region. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No evidence of pneumothorax. Apparent lucency in the left costophrenic sulcus is felt to be related to an area of aerated lung rather than representing a deep sulcus sign.
