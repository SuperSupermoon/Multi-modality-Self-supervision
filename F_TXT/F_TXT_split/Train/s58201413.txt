AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Patient's inspirational effort is very shallow resulting in much higher positioned diaphragms than on the previous portable study. This results in crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature, but there is no conclusive evidence for any new parenchymal infiltrates. On the left base, a crowded vasculature is more marked and the possibility of an atelectasis is given. The right-sided pulmonary vasculature does not disclose an advanced pulmonary congestive pattern. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.
