The cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged, similar to possibly mildly increased as compared to the prior study. Findings could be due to underlying cardiomyopathy however, pericardial effusion is not excluded. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle and there may be a small pleural effusion. Trace effusion is difficult to exclude on the right. Again, there is bilateral hilar prominence and vascular cephalization suggesting mild vascular congestion. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. No pneumothorax is seen.
