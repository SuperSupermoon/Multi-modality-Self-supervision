In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a left chest tube with no evidence of pneumothorax. Right chest tube remains in place with no evidence of pneumothorax. The loculated opacification laterally on the right has substantially decreased. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again seen with atelectatic changes above it. On the left, there has been some decrease in the fluid collection, though retrocardiac opacification with obscuration hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. The new right subclavian PICC line has been removed
