Comparison is made with prior study performed 10 hours earlier. Cardiac size is top normal. Increasing opacities in the left lower lobe could be due to worsening atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Small left pleural effusion has increased. If any, there is a small right pleural effusion. Right Port-A-Cath tip is in the upper SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
