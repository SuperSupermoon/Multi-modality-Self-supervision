1. Interval removal of the right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with the introducer remaining in place with its tip in the proximal SVC. Mediastinal drains remain in place. Lung volumes are somewhat lower, and there is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature and likely interval appearance of mild perihilar and pulmonary edema. Small layering effusions, left greater than right. More patchy opacity at the left lung base most likely reflects patchy atelectasis related to the presence of the effusion. No pneumothorax. On marked patient rotation, assessment of the overall cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult. Status post median sternotomy for CABG.
