A single portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph was obtained. There are bilateral airspace opacities throughout the mid and lower left lung and medial lower right lung most likely reflecting pulmonary edama, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. The cardiac or mediastinal contours are stable. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
