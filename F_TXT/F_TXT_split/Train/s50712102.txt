There has been interval removal of the left-sided chest strain. No pneumothorax seen. There is a moderate left pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis. This is similar to slightly decreased in size when compared to the prior study. A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid to distal SVC. Prominence of pulmonary vasculature with patchy airspace opacities is consistent with a mild pulmonary edema.
