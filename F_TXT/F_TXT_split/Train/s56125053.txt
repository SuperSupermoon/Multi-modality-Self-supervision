Single supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates enteric feeding tube coursing midline with tip within the stomach and side port at the level of the diaphragm. An endotracheal tube is 2.4 cm above the level of the carina within the lower trachea. The lungs are mildly hypoinflated with bilateral perihilar interstitial prominence consistent with vascular crowding. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is likely related to patient positioning and low lung volumes. Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable. Limited evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates multilevel degenerative changes. Visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
