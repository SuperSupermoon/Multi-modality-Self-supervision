This is a limited evaluation due to respiratory motion. There are subtle opacities in the right mid and lower lung. There is persistent atelectasis at the left lung base. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, as before. A right upper extremity PICC terminates in the mid SVC, in unchanged position. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
