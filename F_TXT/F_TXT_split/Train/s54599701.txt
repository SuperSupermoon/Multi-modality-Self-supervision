Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval improvement in the aeration of the left upper lung, with persistent opacification of the left lower lung, likely representing a combination of pleural effusion and atalectasis. There is a small right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Endotracheal tube ends 2.3 cm from the carina. The left-sided subclavian central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction.
