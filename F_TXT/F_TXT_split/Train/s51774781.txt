In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued and possibly increasing hazy opacification in the right hemithorax consistent with pleural fluid despite the placement of a chest tube. The possibility of some of this being loculated must be considered, and a lateral view would be most helpful if clinically possible. No evidence of pneumothorax. Remainder of the study is unchanged.
