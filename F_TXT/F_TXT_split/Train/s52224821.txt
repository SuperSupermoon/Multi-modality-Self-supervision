AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: A left-sided central venous line ends in the low SVC. Right lung is clear and right pleural surfaces are normal. On the left the elevation of the lateral aspect of the lung base is most readily explained by subpulmonic pleural effusion which probably explains greater left infrahilar opacification. A lateral view would be helpful to exclude left lower lobe pneumonia. The upper lungs are clear. Heart size is normal and mediastinal contour is unremarkable. No pneumothorax.
