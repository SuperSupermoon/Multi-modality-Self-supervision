PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained. Compared with the prior exam there is slight increase in left pleural effusion and left basilar consolidation which likely represents compressive atelectasis. There is mild right basilar plate-like atelectasis. Upper lungs appear well aerated. Heart size cannot be assessed. Mediastinal contour appears grossly stable. Bony structures appear intact.
