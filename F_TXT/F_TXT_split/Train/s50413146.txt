Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Relative blunting of the left costophrenic angle is most likely due to overlying soft tissue. There is slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, which may be due to mild pulmonary vascular congestion in conjunction with relatively low lung volumes. No definite focal consolidation is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
