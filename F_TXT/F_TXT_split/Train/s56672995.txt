A left basilar pigtail pleural catheter remains in place and there is a left-sided pneumothorax with loculated components medially and at the left base, probably stable since earlier in the day on ___ but increased since ___. Linear lucency adjacent to the descending aorta may reflect a component of pneumomediastinum. Interval removal of the right pleural pigtail catheter with appearance of a linear basilar lucency suggestive of a loculated air. Opacity in the retrocardiac region is is stable and may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position.
