As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The left chest tube and the central venous access line as well as the feeding tube are in unchanged position. There is unchanged evidence of relatively severe right pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion. In addition to the known apical left pneumothorax seen on the previous exam, this known pneumothorax now also has a subtle lateral component along the bases of the left lateral chest wall. There is no evidence of tension. The slight mediastinal shift to the right as well as the areas of atelectasis at both lung bases are unchanged. Unchanged massive destructive changes at the level of the left shoulder. Unchanged bilateral air collection in the soft tissues. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant.
