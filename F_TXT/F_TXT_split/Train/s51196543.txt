Comparison is made to prior study from ___ at 12:17 p.m. There are bilateral pleural effusions, right side greater than left. There is a left retrocardiac opacity. There are low lung volumes due to poor inspiratory effort. The visualized upper lung fields are grossly clear and there are no pneumothoraces. Overall, the pleural effusion on the right side has increased slightly as has the left retrocardiac opacity.
