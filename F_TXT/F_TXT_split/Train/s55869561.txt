Portable AP semi upright technique and low lung volumes exaggerate the already enlarged cardiac silhouette. Allowing for technique, cardiomediastinal contours appear grossly unchanged. Opacity of the left lung base is most consistent with a combination of moderate size pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation not entirely excluded. The right lung is grossly clear. No pneumothorax. A pacemaker device is present. Extensive degenerative changes are seen in the right glenohumeral joint. The left glenohumeral joint is not well seen due to overlying pacemaker device.
