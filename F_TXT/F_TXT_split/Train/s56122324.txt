The tracheostomy is in place. The tip of the right-sided PICC line is not well visualized, but is likely unchanged in vascular level, overlying the distal SVC/ RA junction. There is improved visualization of the right lung base, likely reflecting significant improvement in a previously seen right pleural effusion. Some residual atelectasis is noted at the right lung base. A small to moderate left effusion with underlying left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation remains present, slightly improved. There is upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, probably similar to the prior study. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is better defined on the right and there appears to be some leftward shift of the mediastinum, consistent with left-sided volume loss. Cervical fixation hardware is again noted.
