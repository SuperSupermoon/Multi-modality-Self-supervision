AP chest compared to ___: Left lower lobe collapse has worsened, pointing strongly to bronchial obstruction, responsible for leftward mediastinal shift. Right lung is grossly clear except for mild atelectasis at the lung base medially. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged, but there is no pulmonary edema. Some left pleural effusion is presumed, but there is none appreciable in the right hemithorax. An upper enteric drainage tube passes into a non-distended stomach and out of view. Dr. ___ was paged at 12:20 p.m. when the findings were recognized.
