A right-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating at the cavoatrial junction. There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. Due to overlying external artifact, it is difficult to exclude a right apical pneumothorax. No large pneumothorax is seen, however. There is no focal consolidation or large pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
