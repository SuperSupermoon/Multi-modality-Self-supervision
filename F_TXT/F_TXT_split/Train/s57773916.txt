Following placement of left-sided chest tube, a left pneumothorax has substantially decreased in size with residual moderate left pneumothorax with apical, lateral and basilar components. Hydropneumothorax is noted in the basilar component. Additionally, pneumomediastinum is present as well as worsening subcutaneous emphysema. With the improvement in the left pneumothorax, there has been substantial improvement in left lung collapse with residual partial atelectasis of the left lower lobe and lingula.
