As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are constant. There is moderate cardiomegaly and retrocardiac atelectasis, combined to blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small left pleural effusion. Overall, the lung parenchyma is relatively dense, no focal parenchymal opacities have newly occurred. The pre-existing opacities are constant in distribution and severity. No pneumothorax.
