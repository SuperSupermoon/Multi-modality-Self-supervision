AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. The lung volumes are preserved as well as there is no change in interstitial linear opacities, chronic, potentially reflecting areas of scarring. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. There is questionable right upper lobe opacity, most likely representing summation of shadows, but repeated radiograph, preferably PA and lateral radiographs for better characterization of this area is recommended. Tortuous aorta is redemonstrated.
