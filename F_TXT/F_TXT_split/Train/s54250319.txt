AP chest read in conjunction with an abdomen study reported separately and compared to chest radiograph 8 p.m. on ___ shows new mild pulmonary edema. Increasing opacification at the lung bases, particularly the left could be edema, atelectasis and increase in small bilateral pleural effusions, but raises serious concern for aspiration. Heart is large, but exaggerated because of the very large paraesophageal gastric hernia which, judging by increased contrast in the lower GI tract, has presumably decompressed of contrast agent which was present, but in the intrathoracic stomach, but not imaged on a study of the abdomen at midnight. An upper enteric drainage tube passes through the gastroesophageal junction and back into the lower portion of the intrathoracic stomach. Based on the sequential changes, although the intrathoracic stomach is still quite dilated, it is not obstructed. These findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at the time of this dictation.
