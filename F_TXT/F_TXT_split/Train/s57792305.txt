Allowing for prominent overlying subcutaneous emphysema and right apical bullous change, no definite pneumothorax is identified. The previously seen curvilinear density is not identified on the current examination. Again seen is the right-sided pigtail catheter, similar in configuration. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears slightly smaller, though this is likely accentuated by differences in positioning. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
