The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Spiculated right apical mass was better seen on a preceding chest CT from ___. Subtle right basilar opacity could be due to atelectasis or infection. Mild left basilar atelectasis is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Right-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating in the low SVC.
