AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 04:14 a.m. The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach, slightly more proximal than prior, but with the side hole at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. The heart size and mediastinum appear to be unchanged as well as the position of the ET tube, 7 cm above the carina. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis are unchanged.
