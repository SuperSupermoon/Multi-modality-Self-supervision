Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates multiple intact median sternotomy wires and evidence of prior CABG procedure. The heart is prominent, but likely accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes. There are aortic arch calcifications, unchanged. Mild interstitial prominence is long standing and certainly less pronounced on current exam. There is no overt pulmonary edema. There is no large pleural effusion. There is subsegmental atelectasis in the retrocardiac region. There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
