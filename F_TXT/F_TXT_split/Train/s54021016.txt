Comparison is made with prior study ___. New right lower lobe opacities are worrisome for aspiration. Left lower lobe opacities are increasing could be due to increasing atelectasis and/or aspiration. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There are low lung volumes. ET tube is in standard position. There is no evident pneumothorax/pleural effusions. Small bowel loops are dilated and air filled. This finding is incompletely evaluated with this radiograph and abdominal film is recommended to exclude bowel obstruction.
