Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Transvenous pacemaker leads are in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the SVC. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions associated with adjacent atelectasis are grossly unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Vascular congestion has almost completely resolved. Apical calcified pleural plaques are again noted.
