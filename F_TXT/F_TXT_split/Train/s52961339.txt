The ETT is in standard position. Enteric tube tip and side port projected with expected region of the stomach in the left upper quadrant. The newly placed right IJ catheter tip projects over the expected region of the SVC -RA junction. Overall, no significant interval change in the radiographic appearance of the heart and lungs. Persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle most likely reflects a small pleural effusion. There is probably mild edema. The heart is top-normal in size. The descending thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous. Aortic knob calcifications are minute old. No pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or significant right pleural effusion. Bibasilar streaky opacities are likely atelectasis. Mild dextroconvex curvature of the thoracic spine is unchanged. No acute osseous abnormality.
