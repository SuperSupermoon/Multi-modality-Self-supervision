Right IJ central line tip overlies the proximal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen is hyperinflation suggesting background COPD. Moderate cardiomegaly, with mediastinal widening, are similar to the prior film. Again noted is radiodensity consistent with trans aortic valve replacement (TAVR). There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion which is similar, possibly very slightly improved. This is probably superimposed on background parenchymal scarring. Blunting of right-greater-than-left costophrenic angles is consistent with a small amount of pleural fluid or thickening. Elevated right hemidiaphragm is again noted. Atelectasis at the right base is slightly more pronounced and atelectasis at the left base is slightly improved. No frank consolidation is identified.
