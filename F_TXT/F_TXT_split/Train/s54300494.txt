A left pectoral pacemaker with 2 leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle is unchanged. A right pleural pigtail catheter is unchanged in position between the right lateral ___ and 7th ribs. There is improved aeration of the right lung base and improved inspiratory effort compared to the most recent prior study. No residual right pleural fluid is noted. There is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle compatible with small left pleural effusion. No definitive evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardio mediastinal silhouette is incompletely evaluate. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits with unchanged rightward deviation and kinking of the trachea in the upper mediastinum.
