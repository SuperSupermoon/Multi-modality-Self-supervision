A tracheostomy tube and left subclavian catheter are unchanged in position compared to the prior study. Right internal jugular and right subclavian catheters had been removed. No pneumothorax seen. Increased opacity at the left lung base has decreased slightly in extent compared to the prior study and likely reflects a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis.
