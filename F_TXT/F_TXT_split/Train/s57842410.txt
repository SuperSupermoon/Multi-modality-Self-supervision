Interval placement of endotracheal tube with tip terminating 2.8 cm above the carina with neck apparently in a flexed position. Tip of nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm but side port is not visualized on this exam. Lung volumes are low, accentuating cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged allowing for differences in lung volumes. New bibasilar opacities, most confluent in the left retrocardiac region, may reflect either atelectasis or aspiration considering their rapid development. Questionable small left pleural effusion, but no evidence of pneumothorax on this supine radiograph.
