The patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary bypass surgery. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Patchy opacity at the right lung base medially favors atelectasis in the recent postoperative setting, but early focus of infection is also possible as well as localized area of aspiration. Linear opacities in left mid and lower lung are probably due to scarring given similar appearance on prior study.
