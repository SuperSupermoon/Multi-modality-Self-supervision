New opacification and volume loss in the right upper lobe is either atelectasis or pneumonia. Right lower has improved atelectasis, but with increasing consolidation. The left lung is well expanded and clear. A very small left apical pneumothorax is present. Endotracheal tube ends approximately 7 cm above the carina. Right central venous catheter terminates in the lower SVC. An NG tube ends at the level of the gastroesophageal junction and needs to be advanced further for optimal positioning.
