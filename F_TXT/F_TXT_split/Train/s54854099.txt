The diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has not worsened generally following extubation but there is more edema in the right lower lung, and lung volumes are lower, as expected. Heart size is normal. Pleural effusions are small if any. Left subclavian line ends low in the SVC. No pneumothorax.
