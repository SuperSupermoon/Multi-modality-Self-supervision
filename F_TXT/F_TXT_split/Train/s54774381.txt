1. Layering bilateral effusions with associated bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. Pulmonary vasculature also appears more ill-defined when compared to previous studies, and therefore, this suggests superimposed pulmonary edema. Endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Heart appears enlarged but stable. Mediastinal contours are also stably widened although this could be related to patient rotation. No large pneumothorax although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished on the supine radiograph.
