Compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a Dobhoff catheter. The catheter shows a normal course, but its coiled in the stomach with its tip pointing towards the fundus. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Left and right central venous lines are unchanged. The median clips after surgery are constant. The patient continues to show bilateral parenchymal opacities, consistent with moderate centralized pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus.
