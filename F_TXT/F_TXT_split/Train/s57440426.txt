As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The endotracheal tube is still in situ. The left and right chest tubes are also unchanged. Nasogastric tube in place. The patient still shows a small left basal pneumothorax which, in the interval, is filled with fluid. A small apical component of this pneumothorax is newly visible. On the left, a small pneumothorax is not visible at the region of the lung apex. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. Improved ventilation at the right lung bases.
