No obvious pneumothorax identified on the current film. Interval improvement in previously seen subcutaneous emphysema in the lower neck/ upper chest. Changes at the right and left lung bases, likely a combination of a small amount of pleural fluid and atelectasis, are similar to the prior study. No new infiltrate is identified. No overt CHF. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
