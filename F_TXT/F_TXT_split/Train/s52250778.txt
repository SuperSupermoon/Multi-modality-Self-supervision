Allowing for marked rotation, enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is grossly stable compared to the previous study. Previously present mild pulmonary edema has improved, particularly in the right lung. Left perihilar haziness probably represents mild residual perihilar edema. Diffuse haziness of the left hemithorax compared to the right could be due to technical factors, but layering left pleural effusion is also possible on this supine radiograph. There has been apparent resolution of a previously present small right pleural effusion. When clinically feasible, repeat non-rotated chest radiograph is recommended for more complete evaluation.
