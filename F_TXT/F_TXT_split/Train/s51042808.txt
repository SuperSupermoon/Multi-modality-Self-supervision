In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes which account for the increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion. There is some increased opacification at the right base medially. This could well reflect a combination of crowded pulmonary vessels and atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting supervening pneumonia could not be definitely excluded.
