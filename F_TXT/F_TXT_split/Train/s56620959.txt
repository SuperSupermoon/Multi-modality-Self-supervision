AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Substantial worsening right lower lobe atelectasis and increasing moderate right pleural effusion. Left lower lobe still collapsed, no change in small accompanying left pleural effusion. Mild interval increase in caliber of the cardiac silhouette could be due to enlarging heart size or accumulation of pericardial fluid, but there is no distention of mediastinal veins to suggest hemodynamically significant effect. No pneumothorax.
