The ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placements. Right internal jugular line ends in the upper right atrium. Large scale consolidation in the right upper lobe is now punctuated with small air collections. Although this might be due to reaeration, it could also be early cavitation. Less confluent consolidation involves a large region of the left lung, probably lingula and superior segment of the left lower lobe. The findings overall are most readily explained by pneumonia, but but hemorrhage is a possibility, and the bronchial obstruction, particularly on the right, should be kept in mind. Small right pleural effusion is likely. Heart is not enlarged.
