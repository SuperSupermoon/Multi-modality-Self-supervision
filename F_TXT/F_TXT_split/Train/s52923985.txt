As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the right internal jugular vein catheter has been removed. The other monitoring and support devices remain in place. Moderate cardiomegaly persists, with a mildly increasing left lower lobe atelectasis. No other pathological changes in the lung parenchyma, in particular no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
