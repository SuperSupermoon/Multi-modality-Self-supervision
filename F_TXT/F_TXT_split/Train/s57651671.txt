Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance, and pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits considering low lung volumes. Patchy and linear opacification in the left lower lobe has increased from the prior radiograph, particularly in the periphery of the left lung base. This probably represents worsening atelectasis, the differential diagnosis for the peripheral opacity includes developing infectious pneumonia and pulmonary infarction. A nonspecific small peripheral opacity has also developed at the right lung base. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
