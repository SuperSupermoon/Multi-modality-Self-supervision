Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Right-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen, distal aspect likely terminating in the mid SVC. Linear left mid lung opacity is likely due to chronic atelectasis/scarring. There is also mild right base atelectasis. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
