As compared to ___ radiograph 521, a nasogastric tube has been inserted, terminating within the distal stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Substantial improvement in left lower lobe atelectasis, but slight worsening of left perihilar opacities. A peripheral curvilinear interface in the upper right hemi thorax probably reflects a skin fold, but attention to this finding on short-term followup radiograph would be helpful to exclude an atypical pneumothorax.
