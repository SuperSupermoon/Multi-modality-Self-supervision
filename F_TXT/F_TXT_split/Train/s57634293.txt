Supine portable AP view of the chest provided demonstrates endotracheal tube residing within the trachea with its tip approximately 4.8 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube descends into the left upper quadrant with the distal side port at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. Linear density in the left mid to upper lung is stable and compatible with scarring. No large consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is an expansile and sclerotic appearance of the left second rib, better assessed on prior CT, which is compatible with metastatic disease. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, excreted contrast is noted within the bilateral renal collecting system.
