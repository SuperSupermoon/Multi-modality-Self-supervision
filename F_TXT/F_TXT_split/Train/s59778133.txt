As compared to the previous radiograph, a previous Dobbhoff catheter has been removed and replaced by a nasogastric tube. The nasogastric tube shows a normal course. The tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach. There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, with a left-sided correctly positioned PICC line. Minimal atelectasis at the lung bases and in the retrocardiac lung areas. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumonia.
