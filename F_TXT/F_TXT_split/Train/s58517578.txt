As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube has been slightly advanced and the tip now projects over the mid parts of the stomach. The existing parenchymal opacities are overall unchanged in extent, but appear more concentrated around the perihilar areas. Minimal pleural effusions and bilateral apical thickening persists. No new parenchymal changes.
