1. Left-sided single-lead pacer remains in place. A right basilar chest tube is in place with extensive right lateral chest wall and neck subcutaneous emphysema with a stable small right apical pneumothorax. There continues to be a stable airspace abnormality in the right mid and lower lung, possibly representing postinflammatory changes and/or atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. The left lung is grossly clear. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
