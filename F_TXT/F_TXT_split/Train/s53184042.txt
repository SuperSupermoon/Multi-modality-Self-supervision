In comparison with study of ___, there is some increase in the opacifications both diffusely and at the bases with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms. This most likely is consistent with continued bilateral layering pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis plus some increasing elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Central catheter tip again extends to the mid portion of the SVC. Of incidental note are cervical fixation devices.
