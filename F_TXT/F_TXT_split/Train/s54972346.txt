A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the upper superior vena cava. There is no evidence for pneumothorax. The left lung base is better aerated with decrease in the extent of elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and basilar opacification of the left lung. A right basilar opacity is unchanged. Early pneumonia could be considered. There is also some suggestion of upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vascularity. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.
