Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a left chest tube with tip projecting between the left posterior sixth and seventh ribs. Sideports are intrathoracic in appropriate position. The lungs are hypoinflated with vascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis. New small left pleural effusion is present. No right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Enlargement of heart size is due to patient positioning and low lung volumes. Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
