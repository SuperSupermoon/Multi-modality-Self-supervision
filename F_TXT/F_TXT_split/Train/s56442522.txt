Again seen is the drain along the base of the right lung. There is minimal atelectasis. Equivocal trace pneumothorax at the right lung apex. Previously seen lucency at right lung base is no longer visualized. New on today's exam, there is an ellipsoid opacity in the right mid zone. This is partly accounted for by the overlying scapular angle. Doubt pneumonic consolidation. Bibasilar atelectasis is slightly increased. Upper zone redistribution is also slightly more pronounced. No gross left effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged.
