Single upright portable view of the chest demonstrates median sternotomy wires and vascular clips, unchanged compared to the prior study, with fracture of the superior most median sternotomy wire. The lung volumes are low in comparison with the prior study, with associated bibasilar atelectasis and persistent bilateral interstitial pulmonary edema, slightly worse on the left. The heart is mild to moderately enlarged, but stable since the prior exam. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Bilateral apical pleural thickening is again seen.
