Compared with the prior film, I doubt significant interval change. The patient is status post sternotomy, with sternal wires and mediastinal clips. A left-sided line, bilateral chest tubes, and right upper quadrant abdominal surgical clips again noted. No pneumothorax is detected. There is upper zone re-distribution and vascular plethora, consistent with CHF. There is opacity at both lung bases, unchanged. Background COPD again noted.
