AP chest radiograph. As compared to prior examination obtained the same day earlier at 11 a.m., there is a minimal interval change in the small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax. The suspicion for pneumopericardium is still present (versus pneumomediastinum) given the lucency along the left cardiomediastinal border. Lungs are otherwise clear except for minimal right basal atelectasis. Pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location.
