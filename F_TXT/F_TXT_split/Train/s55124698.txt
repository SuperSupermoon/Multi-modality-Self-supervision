Comparison is made with prior study performed 10 hours earlier. Extensive bilateral lung opacities have minimally improved in the right upper lobe. Otherwise, there are no other interval changes. Lines and tubes are in standard position. Cardiomediastinum is obscured by the lung opacities. If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
