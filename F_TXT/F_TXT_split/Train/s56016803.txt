As compared to the previous radiograph, the left pleural effusion has moderately increased in extent, causing more atelectatic lung portions at the level of the retrocardiac lung areas and at the level of the left hilus. On the right, parenchymal consolidations, hemi at the bases and the perihilar areas have increased in extent. The post drainage right basal pneumothorax on the right has minimally increased in extent. The monitoring and support devices are all in unchanged position.
