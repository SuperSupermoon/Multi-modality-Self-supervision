Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in standard position. Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. Slight improvement in degree of vascular distention but persistent widespread, asymmetrically distributed combined alveolar and interstitial pattern with relative sparing of portions of the right upper lobe. Observed findings could be due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but alternative or coexisting processes such as infection and hemorrhage are possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
