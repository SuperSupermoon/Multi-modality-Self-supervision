CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An NG type tube is present, the tip overlies the mid mediastinum to the right, likely in the neoesophagus. A right-sided chest tube is present. No pneumothorax is detected. Clips again noted over the lower neck. Tube or drain previously seen over the left neck is not well seen on the current examination, though may have been excluded from the image. There is a small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Mild upper zone redistribution is present. Compared with ___ at 16:36 p.m. and allowing for considerable differences in positioning, there is minimal if any interval change.
