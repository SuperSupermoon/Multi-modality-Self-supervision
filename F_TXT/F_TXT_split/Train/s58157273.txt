New opacities at the left lung base, and a linear area of opacification in the left mid lung, are likely atelectasis. Subtle opacity at the right lung base is unchanged. Increase indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature may relate to differences in technique, though developing mild pulmonary edema is also a possibility. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is mildly enlarged and the mediastinum is unremarkable.
