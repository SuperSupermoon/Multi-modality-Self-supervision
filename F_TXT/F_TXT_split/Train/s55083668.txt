In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a Dobbhoff tube that extends to the lower body of the stomach. Tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. There is patchy opacification in the retrocardiac region with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm. This suggests volume loss and possible effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
