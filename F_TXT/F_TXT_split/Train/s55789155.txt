Two right-sided chest tubes are visualized, one of which is new. There continues to be elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and a moderate-sized right effusion. There is hazy increased opacity projecting over the right lung and it is unclear if this is due to a layering effusion or if there is an alveolar infiltrate on the right. The left heart border is obscured, possibly secondary to volume loss or small infiltrate. There is no pneumothorax.
