There is an ill-defined opacity in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, well delineated by the minor fissure, which is new compared with prior exam. There is also an ill defined opacification of the right lower lung field obscuring the right hear border. In the left, there is a moderate pleural effusion with concurrent atelectasis, and a peripheral opacity in the lower lung field that was seen in prior exam and might represent loculated effusion versus scarring. The heart is moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Sternotomy wires are intact.
