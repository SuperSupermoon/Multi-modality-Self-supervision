AP chest compared to ___: Allowing for differences in projection, PA versus AP, mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is probably unchanged, following placement of pericardial drainage catheter projected over the mid portion of the cardiac silhouette. Small left pleural effusion has increased and aeration at the left base worsened, probably atelectasis. Aside from a scar-like lesion in the right upper lung, right lung is clear. Small right pleural effusion is new. No pneumothorax.
