Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.2 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image, but side port likely in the location of the proximal stomach. Left-sided central venous catheter is stable in position, terminating in the right atrium. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle and slight left base opacity which may be due to left base atelectasis and small pleural effusion. The right lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.
