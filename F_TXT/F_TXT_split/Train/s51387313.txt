Interval placement of a new right-sided PICC line with tip ending superiorly and likely ending within the right internal jugular vein. Examination somewhat limited due to exclusion of the right costophrenic angle. Otherwise, unchanged exam with unremarkable mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours. Stable retrocardiac opacification likely represents atelectasis.
