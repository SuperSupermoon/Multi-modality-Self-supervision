There has been interval improvement in aeration of the right lung base with residual linear atelectasis. Lung volumes are grossly unchanged. There is persistent moderate cardiomegaly. No pleural effusion or consolidation seen. A dense opacity at the right upper lobe is likely a calcified granuloma. Calcifications in the left upper abdomen are consistent with splenic granulomas.
