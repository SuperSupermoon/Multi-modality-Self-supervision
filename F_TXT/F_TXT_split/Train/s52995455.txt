An ET tube tip lies approximately is 6.1 cm above the carina, below the level of the clavicular heads. . An NG tube is present, tip overlying the stomach. No pneumothorax is detected. There is moderate cardiomegaly. Prominence of the mediastinal silhouette is noted, but could relate to vascular structures and supine positioning. Upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring is compatible CHF and inter, stitial edema. Hazy opacity at the right base could represent a small to moderate layering pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. The left costophrenic sulcus is grossly clear.
