Since the prior examination, a right-sided pigtail catheter has been placed. The right lung has re-expanded. Small residual right apical pneumothorax is suspected. Rounded right apical mass is again noted as well as vague opacity in the adjacent right upper lung slightly more inferiorly with fiducial marker in place. Otherwise, no change.
