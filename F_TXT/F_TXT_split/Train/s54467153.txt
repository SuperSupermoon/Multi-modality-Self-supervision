Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Lines and tubes are in unchanged position. The left subclavian tip is still in the upper right atrium. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusions. Multifocal opacities, larger on the bases bilaterally have improved.
