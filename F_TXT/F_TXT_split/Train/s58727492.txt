Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 8 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, into the left upper quadrant, into the expected location of the stomach. Small left pleural effusion is seen. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Subtle bibasilar opacities may relate to vascular congestion, but aspiration is not excluded. Cardiac silhouette size is top-normal. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. No pneumothorax is seen.
