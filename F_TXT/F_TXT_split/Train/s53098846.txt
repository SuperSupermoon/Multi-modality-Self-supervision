Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates stable cardiomegaly. New consolidation in the upper lobes and right lower lobe is most likely pneumonia. There is also retrocardiac opacity which could represent dependent atelectasis versus additional site of consolidation. Trace effusions cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax or vascular congestion.
