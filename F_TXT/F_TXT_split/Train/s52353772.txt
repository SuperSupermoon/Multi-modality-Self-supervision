Previous moderate right pleural effusion has resolved. Mediastinum has returned to a midline position. There is an unusual nearly vertical contour in the left mid and lower chest dividing greater radiopacity medially from hyperlucency laterally. An upright chest radiograph is recommended to determine if this is pneumothorax. Greater opacification in the left lower lobe generally, now obscuring the diaphragmatic surface, is most readily explained by new atelectasis. Given the clinical history, aspiration may be contributory. Left pleural effusion is small if any. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is chronic. Right lung is clear. ET tube is in standard placement. The tube cough is sharply defined by secretions retained above it. Findings were discussed at length with the clinical care team in conference this morning.
