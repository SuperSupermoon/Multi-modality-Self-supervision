The new ET tube is slightly too high at 8.9 cm above the carina; it could be advanced around 3 cm. Right-sided jugular line ends in the mid SVC and NG tube is in adequate position. Right chest tube is possibly fissural, but there is no pneumothorax. Left lower lobe collapse with mild pleural effusion is stable. Small right pleural effusion and mild lower lobe atelectasis is new. Multiple right rib fractures and right clavicle fracture are unchanged. Mediastinal and cardiac contour are normal.
