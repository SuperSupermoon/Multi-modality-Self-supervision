Comparison is made to prior study from ___. The tip of the right IJ line is again in the right atrium and this could be pulled back 3-4 cm for more optimal placement. There is a nasogastric tube whose tip is now no longer pointing at the GE junction but is off the field of the study and likely within the body of the stomach. Endotracheal tube has been removed. There are markedly low lung volumes and atelectasis. No focal infiltrates are seen.
