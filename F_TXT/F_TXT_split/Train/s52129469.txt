As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left-sided chest tube. There is reexpansion of the left lung, although a minimal pneumothorax at the level of the left costophrenic sinus might still be present. The mid and lower portions of the left lung show parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting re-expansion edema. The retrocardiac lung areas remain atelectatic. The very extensive changes on the right are constant in extent and severity. The endotracheal tube has been pulled back, the tip now projects 2 cm above the carina. The other monitoring and support devices are in constant and correct position.
