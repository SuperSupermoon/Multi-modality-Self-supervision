AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained 12 hours earlier during the same day. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. The same holds for the previously described NG tube. Heart size is unchanged and no increased pulmonary congestive vascular pattern is identified. No pneumothorax is present. Previously identified suspicious contour in the right apical area is now well identified as edge of scapula. Thus, no suspicion for pneumothorax.
