There has been slight reduction in right pleural effusion and an increase in the aeration of the right lung. Pulmonary edema also appears slightly improved; however there still remains significant pleural effusion and pulmonary edema. Dense left retrocardiac lower lobe consolidation is unchanged. Cardiomegaly is stable. An ET tube is seen in position terminating no less than 5.8 cm from the carina. An NG tube is seen entering the stomach and then out of field of view. A right IJ catheter is seen terminating within the upper right atrium and can be pulled back by 3 cm so that it terminates within the low SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
