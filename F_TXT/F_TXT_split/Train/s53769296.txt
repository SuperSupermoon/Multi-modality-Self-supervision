Comparison is made with prior study performed six hours earlier. There has been interval continual worsening in consolidation of the left lung, mainly in the left upper lobe. Ill-defined consolidations in the right upper and right lower lobe have also minimally increased. These are consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Cardiac size is normal. ET tube is in a standard position. NG tube has been removed.
