Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates indistinct pulmonary vasculature and scattered septal line, with probable bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal clips are noted. There are no sternotomy wires. The left-sided pacemaker is seen with 1 lead terminating in the right atrium and 1 lead terminating in the right ventricle. No definite consolidation is identified.
