The lung volumes are low, accounting for some vascular crowding. There is fullness of the right cardiphrenic angle which may represent patchy atelectasis although aspiration and/or pneumonia cannot be excluded.

More focal nodularity in the right upper lobe contiguous to the ___ costochondral joint is felt to be due to a combination of patient's rotation and degenerative changes. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Heart is likely upper limits of normal in size given portable technique. There is no radiopaque foreign object visible in the thorax.
