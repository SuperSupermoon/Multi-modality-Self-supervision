A large retrocardiac opacity with an air-fluid level is seen on multiple prior examinations and is consistent with a known large hiatal hernia. Slightly increased left lower lobe consolidation and linear right middle lobe opacity, correspond with areas of atelectatic collapse seen on concurrent CT. There is no pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema or pleural effusions are evident. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged from prior. A healed though persistently deformed left humeral head fracture is again noted.
