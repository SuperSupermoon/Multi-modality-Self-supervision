Comparison is made with prior study performed 6 hours earlier. ET tube tip is 3.6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. Left basal chest tube and left basal pigtail catheter are again seen in unchanged positions. There is a small left apical pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the right as before. Cardiac size cannot be evaluation. Right lower lobe consolidation and loss of volume are unchanged. Right small probably loculated pleural effusion is unchanged. Right upper lobe opacities consistent with infection are increased. Lingular opacities consistent with infection are unchanged. Left upper lobe opacities are new.
