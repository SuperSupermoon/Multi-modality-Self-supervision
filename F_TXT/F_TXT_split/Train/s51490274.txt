AP chest compared to 11:53 p.m. on ___: Right pleural catheter has been partially withdrawn, and the apical component of right pneumothorax has decreased substantially. There is no appreciable pleural effusion, and I doubt there is a large basilar component of pleural air either. Lung volumes remain small, but there is no focal abnormality in either lung. Heart size is normal. The transvenous right atrial and ventricular leads are in standard positions.
