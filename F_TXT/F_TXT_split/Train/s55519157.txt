As compared to the previous study from 1 day earlier, support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. A new area of increased opacity at the right lung base may be due to a partially layering pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis, but a localized area of aspiration or early focus of pneumonia are also possible, and short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
