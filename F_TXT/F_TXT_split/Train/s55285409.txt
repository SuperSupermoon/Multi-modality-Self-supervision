ET tube ends in the lower trachea. Left IJ central venous catheter ends in the mid to lower SVC. Nasogastric tube courses below the hemidiaphragm, tip not visualized. The left costophrenic angle has been excluded from the field of view. Left-sided chest tube is unchanged in position. A partially imaged VP shunt catheter has no kinks or discontinuities along its imaged course. There is no pneumothorax. Small subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged. The previous left basilar airspace opacity has cleared, and may have been due to atelectasis. Mild vascular engorgement without frank edema is unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal despite the projection.
