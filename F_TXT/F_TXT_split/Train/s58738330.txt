As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in bilateral perihilar opacities and an increase in peribronchial cuffing, both changes reflecting an increase in severity of pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions might have newly occurred. The external pacemaker is in unchanged position. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
