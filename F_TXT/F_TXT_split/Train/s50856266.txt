Comparison is made with prior study performed eight hours earlier. Moderate right pneumothorax has increased, partially due to change in position of the patient. Bilateral pleural effusions and opacities in the lungs have also changed due to the position of the layering pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Subcutaneous emphysema on the right has minimally improved. Right pleural catheter is unchanged.
