Since the prior radiograph performed approximately 30 minutes earlier, the endotracheal tube has been retracted and now terminates approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. However, the neck is flexed during this study, and the tip of the tube will likely be too low when the head position changes. There is otherwise no significant interval change. Right internal jugular catheter and enteric tube are unchanged. Lung volumes remain low, particularly on the left where there is a moderately-sized pleural effusion. The right lung is essentially clear. No pneumothorax. Heart size is mildly enlarged.
