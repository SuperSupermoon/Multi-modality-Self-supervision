1. Right subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Left basilar chest tube remains in place. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The endotracheal tube appears to be near the edge of the film and now has its tip approximately 9-10 cm above the carina. Advancement is advised. 2. There continues to be near complete opacification of the left hemithorax with a more loculated component at the left apical lateral region. There is likely a layering pleural effusion. The right lung remains grossly clear, although it is relatively low in volume with crowding of the vasculature. No pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Results of this examination were conveyed by text page on ___ at 9:30 a.m. to Dr. ___. A follow up chest film was subsequently ordered after repositioning of the ETT which confirms receipt of the message.
