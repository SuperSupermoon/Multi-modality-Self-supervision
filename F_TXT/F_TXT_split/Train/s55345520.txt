A portable frontal view of the chest shows a right chest tube with the proximal port in an extrapleural location. There has been satisfactory expansion of the lung with no definite residual pneumothorax. Streaky opacities throughout the right lung may reflect atelectasis. The left lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
