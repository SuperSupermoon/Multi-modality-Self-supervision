Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of a small left pleural effusion. The extent of this effusion is similar compared to the prior study. A trace right pleural effusion appears increased compared to prior. The mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged. There may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt pulmonary edema is identified. Left basilar opacification likely reflects atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
