The heart size is top normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits and unchanged. The aorta is slightly tortuous. The lung volumes are low, resulting in bibasilar atelectasis. However, there is a superimposed right basilar opacity which could represent aspiration or early pneumonia. Linear left basilar opacities reflect atelectasis versus focal scarring, unchanged since the ___ examination, but new neighboring opacities are also concerning for mild aspiration/consolidation. There is no pneumothorax. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is suggestive of a tiny pleural effusion.
