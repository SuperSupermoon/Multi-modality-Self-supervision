Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation. Endotracheal tube has been slightly withdrawn, but remains low lying with tip approximately 1.5 cm from the carina. Right internal jugular central venous catheter and enteric tubes are in unchanged positions. Mild enlargement of the heart is re- demonstrated with left ventricular predominance. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Lung volumes are low. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Retrocardiac opacity is overall improved from the previous exam, and may reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded. A probable small left pleural effusion appears unchanged. Right lung is clear. No pneumothorax is clearly identified. Remote left-sided rib fractures are demonstrated.
