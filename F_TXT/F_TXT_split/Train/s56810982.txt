A two-lead pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right ventricle and coronary sinus is noted. The heart appears normal in size. Mild unfolding is noted along the thoracic aorta with calcification. Heterogeneous opacification is noted along each lower lung. Opacities are noted in both infrahilar regions, more extensive on the left than right. Particularly striking is patchy mid and peripheral right lower lung opacities. It is difficult to exclude a small pleural effusion on the right given partial exclusion of the costophrenic sulcus. Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus may be due to a small effusion or chronic thickening. There is no pneumothorax.
