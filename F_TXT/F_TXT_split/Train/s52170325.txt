As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices, including the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube as well as the right internal jugular vein hemodialysis catheter are in unchanged position. The patient presents with pulmonary edema of unchanged severity, as reflected by cardiomegaly, increased diameter of the vascular structures, interstitial markings and the potential small right pleural effusion. The lung volumes remain low. Pre-existing areas of pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax.
