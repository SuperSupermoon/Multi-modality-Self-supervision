The endotracheal tube ends 5.7 cm above the carina. An esophageal tube is seen ending beyond the gastroesophageal junction, with the tip out of view. Sternotomy wires are intact. Assessment of pulmonary pathology is limited due to limitations of this exam, including anti lordotic projection and low lung volumes. However bilateral opacities in the perihilar regions and projecting over the cardiophrenic angles are present, more pronounced in the left. There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm margin. There may be a small layering pleural effusion in the left as well. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
