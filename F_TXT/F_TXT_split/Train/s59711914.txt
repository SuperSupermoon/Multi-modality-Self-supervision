Patient is rotated and supine, preventing strict comparison to prior studies. Opacification of the left lung base appears similar compared to multiple prior examinations and likely reflects a combination of moderate pleural effusion and associated atelectasis, but perhaps new consolidation and/or increase in left pleural effusion. Linear opacity in the right lung base is suggestive of subsegmental atelectasis. Prominent interstitial markings are likely secondary to AP supine technique and bronchovascular crowding due to low lung volumes. No overt pulmonary edema is identified. Mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited due to basilar opacities. No pneumothorax is evident.
