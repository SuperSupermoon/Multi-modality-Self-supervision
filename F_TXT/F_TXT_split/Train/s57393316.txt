Mild cardiac enlargement has improved slightly and mediastinal veins are not quite as distended. This hemodynamic improvement probably explains the decrease in extent of probable right lower lobe pneumonia. The small more compact region of the left lower lobe consolidation either atelectasis or pneumonia has not improved. Pleural effusion is presumed, but not substantial. No pneumothorax. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Left jugular line ends in the upper SVC.
