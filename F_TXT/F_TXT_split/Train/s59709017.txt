In comparison to the recent chest radiograph on ___, there is slightly increased opacification of the left lung base, which may be due to a combination of pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. The right lung is essentially clear. There is no pneumothorax bilaterally. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. The endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina. Left subclavian line terminates at the low SVC. Of note, the enteric tube has been pulled back, and now terminates in the upper esophagus.
