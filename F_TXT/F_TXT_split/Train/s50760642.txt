There is no interval change in the appearance of the chest since the earlier study performed at 19:45. Again seen is a pacemaker in the left chest wall with a single lead terminating in the region of the right ventricle. Again seen are bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, representing layering pleural fluid and/or atelectasis. The heart remains markedly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours remain unchanged. No pneumothorax is seen. There are degenerative changes of the bilateral glenohumeral joints.
