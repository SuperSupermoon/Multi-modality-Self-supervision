One portable upright view of the chest. Since the prior study, a right PICC line has been removed. Given the limitations of portable technique, the lungs are grossly clear. There is mild cardiomegaly. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. A calcific density overlying the right axilla is similar to prior CT and may represent a calcified lymph node.
