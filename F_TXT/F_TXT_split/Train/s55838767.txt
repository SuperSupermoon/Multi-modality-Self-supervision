Since the previous radiograph, a right PICC has been replaced or repositioned, now terminating in the mid superior vena cava. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable in size. Asymmetrically distributed left perihilar opacification appears slightly worse compared to the recent study, but has improved compared to ___. Additional opacities in the adjacent left retrocardiac area have slightly improved since the more recent study of ___. Within the right lung, an apparently new opacity in the right infrahilar region could potentially be due to atelectasis given lower lung volumes on today's study, but differential diagnosis includes focal aspiration and developing pneumonia. Followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
