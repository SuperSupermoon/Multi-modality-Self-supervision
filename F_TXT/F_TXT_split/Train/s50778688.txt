Portable frontal upper radiograph of the chest demonstrates a nasogastric tube extending below the diaphragm and curling back up to the tip likely within the hiatus hernia near the GE junction. Lower lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis. Stable heart size and mediastinal contours. The upper abdomen demonstrates multiple air-filled loops of small and large bowel. Difficult to determine if there is any free intraperitoneal air; however, this would be expected given recent exploratory laparotomy.
