Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are numerous old left-sided rib fractures/old rib deformities again seen. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggesting a small left pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. There is also old right clavicular fracture. A left retrocardiac opacity may relate to atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded.
