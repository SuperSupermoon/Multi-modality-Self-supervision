Compared with the prior radiograph, the NG tube, right PICC line in the upper SVC, and right pleural drain are unchanged in position. There is a moderate right pleural effusion despite the right pleural drain, with persistent right basilar atelectasis. Left lung atelectasis is unchanged without effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. An enlarged cardiac silhouette is stable.
