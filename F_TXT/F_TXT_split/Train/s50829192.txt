1. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Endotracheal tube and left internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably enlarged. There is interval worsening of a bilateral interstitial process, likely reflecting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. In addition, there are layering bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace disease, left greater than right, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No pneumothorax.
