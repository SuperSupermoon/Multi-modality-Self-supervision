Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates an area of increased opacification in the right mid lung, which likely represents a right lower lobe consolidation representing either atelectasis or pneumonia. There are small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. A right-sided PICC line ends in the mid SVC. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach out of the field-of-view. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Severe degenerative changes are seen in both shoulder joints and intact cervical plate is present
