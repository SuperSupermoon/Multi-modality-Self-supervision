The heart size is moderately enlarged. There is low lung volumes with volume loss at the bases. The left hemidiaphragm is ill-defined and is unclear if this is due to volume loss/ infiltrate/effusion. There is mild pulmonary vascular redistribution. The superior mediastinum is prominent but this may be secondary to projection. It would be helpful to the compared old films if available.
