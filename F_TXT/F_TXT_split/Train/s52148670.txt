AP chest compared to ___ at 6:10 a.m.: Endotracheal tube is in standard placement, upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view, right internal jugular line ends in the right atrium, at a level 7.5 cm below the carina and would need to be withdrawn 3.5 cm to reposition it low in the SVC, if desired. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Lung volumes have improved since earlier in the day, but very extensive consolidation in the left lung has not and there is more multifocal consolidation on the right, somewhat nodular appearance, all suggesting severe widespread pneumonia and possible hematogenous dissemination of infection, particularly in the right lung. At least mild pulmonary edema is also present. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. No pneumothorax.
