An endotracheal tube terminates 2.9 cm above the carina. An enteric tube descends below the diaphragm and below the field of view. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Increased opacity at the base of the left lung likely represents a small left pleural effusion and atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
