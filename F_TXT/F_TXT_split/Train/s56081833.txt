Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval worsening of a left mid lung opacification which could represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, however, this could also be seen with asymmetric pulmonary edema. There are persistent bilateral interstitial opacities consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. There is no interval change in heart size. No pneumothorax is seen.
