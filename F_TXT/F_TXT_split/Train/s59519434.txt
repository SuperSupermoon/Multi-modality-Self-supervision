Moderate right pleural effusion is larger, and moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is also worsened consistent with progressive cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. Elevated left hemidiaphragm obscures cardiac apex. Pulmonary vasculature is mildly to moderately engorged, but there is no definite pulmonary edema. Transvenous right atrial and ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses from the left pectoral generator. No pneumothorax
