An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.1 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, overlying fundus. There is cardiomegaly, with an unfolded aorta. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. Probable left effusion. Hazy density at the right base may also reflect some pleural fluid, though the extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the film. There is increased retrocardiac density and partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Compared with ___, the CHF findings are new and the left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is worse.
