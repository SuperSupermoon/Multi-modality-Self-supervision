Two chest tubes remain in place in the right hemithorax, with a small right apicolateral pneumothorax and a small residual right pleural effusion with a probable area of focal loculation laterally. Overall improved pulmonary edema pattern with residual asymmetrical edema involving the right lung. Persistent right mid and lower lung opacities which may reflect atelectasis and/or consolidation.
