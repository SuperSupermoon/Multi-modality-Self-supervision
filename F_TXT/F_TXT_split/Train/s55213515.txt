AP chest compared to ___: New peribronchial opacification in the left lower lobe on ___ has resolved, presumably atelectasis. Lungs are low in volume but clear. There is no pleural abnormality. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements. An upper enteric drainage tube passes as far as the distal stomach, but its course after that is uncertain. Transvenous pacer defibrillator lead tip projects over the lower right ventricle, as before. No pneumothorax.
