There is a well-circumscribed opacity at the right lung base measuring approximately 5.7 x 4.5 cm. Although this obscures the right heart border, this is relatively dense and there is the suggestion of an abnormality to the underlying right tenth rib. This may reflect a chest wall abnormality rather than a true parenchymal abnormality. Recommend CT chest to further evaluate. The left lung is clear. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Bones are diffusely osteopenic.
