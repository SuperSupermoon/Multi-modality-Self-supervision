New right middle and lower lobe collapse, notably where the enteric tube was mistakenly initially placed in the prior radiographs, before appropriate advancement into the stomach. Left lower lobe atelectasis is improved and a new small left pleural effusion is probably unchanged. Marked dilation of the aortic arch with rightward tracheal deviation is unchanged. Heart size is normal. Visualized cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are otherwise unremarkable. An enteric tube passes below the diaphragm and outside the field of view. Median sternotomy wires and lumbar fusion hardware are noted.
