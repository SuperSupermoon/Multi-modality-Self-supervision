Comparison is made with prior study ___. Increasing peripheral opacities in the right is due to increasing effusion. Right pigtail catheter is in place. Left lower lobe opacities have improved consistent with improving atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. ET tube is in standard position. Left IJ catheter tip is in the upper-to-mid SVC. Diffuse bilateral consolidations, larger on the right lung have improved.
