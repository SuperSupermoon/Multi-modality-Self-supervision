The heart is again enlarged. Mitral annular calcifications are present. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The pulmonary vascularity is indistinct, which is a new finding, suggesting mild vascular congestion. Patchy additional basilar opacities suggest atelectasis. The right glenohumeral joint is moderately narrowed with upward subluxation of the humeral head. The left humeral head is attenuated and flattened with a deformity of the glenoid and narrowing of the glenohumeral joint. Soft tissue calcifications also project immediately inferior to the joint. The bones are probably demineralized.
