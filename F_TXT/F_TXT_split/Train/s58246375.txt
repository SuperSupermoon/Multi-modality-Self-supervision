Again noted is a large hiatal hernia. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Streaky opacifications in the left inferior hilar region were present before to some extent and can be expected as chronic atelectasis is often seen in association with a large hiatal hernia. However, it appears more prominent than before and the possibility of superimposed pneumonia could be considered. There is probably a trace pleural effusion on the left. A very small pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on the right.
