Two right apical chest tubes remain in place. The ET tube is unchanged in position, terminating at the level of the clavicles. The abnormal contour of the right mediastinum is due to a gastric pull-through in this patient who is status post esophagectomy. Bilateral airspace opacities are unchanged. The heart and mediastinum are magnified by the projection. There is no obvious pneumothorax.
