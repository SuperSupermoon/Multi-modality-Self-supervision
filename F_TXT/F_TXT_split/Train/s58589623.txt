Again seen is a right IJ line, with tip at proximal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged. Sternotomy wires again noted. There are low inspiratory volumes. There is upper zone redistribution, without definite CHF. Patchy increased retrocardiac density is consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and atelectasis is also noted at the left base. A small right effusion is likely present.
