1. Heterogeneous opacities in the right lung are consistent with history of pneumonia. Consider a contrast-enhanced chest CT to exclude a postobstructive process and to better characterize an apparently loculated right pleural effusion, the latter raising the possibility of empyema. 2. New patchy opacity at the left base is nonspecific, but may reflect additional site of infection, 3. New pulmonary vascular congestion. These above abnormalities can be further evaluated with a CT of the chest.
