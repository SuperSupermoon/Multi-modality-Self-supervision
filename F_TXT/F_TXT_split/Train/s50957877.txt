Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. Again seen are prominent interstitial markings and evidence of vascular engorgement, which have decreased slightly over the interval. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. The left hemi-diaphragm is elevated. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
