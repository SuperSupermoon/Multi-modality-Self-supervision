Interval placement of a right-sided chest tube in a basilar position with at least a moderate sized right pneumothorax present, difficult to quantify on this supine radiograph. Pre-existing left-sided chest tube is unchanged in position with persistent small left pneumothorax. Extensive pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema persist. Dense opacification in the right retrocardiac region corresponds to collapsed lung in the right lower lobe on recent chest CT. Although nonspecific, right bronchial injury should be considered given the constellation of these findings. Bilateral rib fractures have been more fully evaluated by recent CT.
