As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the large right pleural effusion is constant. Also constant are the subsequent areas of atelectasis caused by this effusion. Slightly more extensive than on the previous image is a small left pleural effusion with subsequent retrocardiac atelectasis. The size of the cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Clips after CABG and sternal wires are in unchanged position.
