CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 4.6 cm above the carina. Two orogastric-type tubes are present. In both cases, the tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film. A right IJ central line is present, the tip overlies the SVC/RA junction, possibly over the uppermost right atrium. An additional dual-lumen line is present, tips overlying the distal SVC/RA junction in right atrium. There may be a very tiny pneumothorax at the right lung apex -- attention to this area on follow-up films is requested. Subcutaneous emphysema in the right supraclavicular region is again noted. Mild vascular prominence and scattered atelectasis is present. No frank consolidation or effusion identified.
