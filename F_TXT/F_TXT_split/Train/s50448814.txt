As compared to the previous radiograph, the PICC line has been minimally pulled back. The tip now projects over the mid-to-lower SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The preexisting parenchymal opacity at the right lung base has minimally improved. Signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema persist.
