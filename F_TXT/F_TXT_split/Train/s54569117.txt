The endotracheal and left apical chest tube have been removed. A small to moderate left apical pneumothorax was likely obscured by the apical chest tube. A left subclavian central venous catheter extends to the upper right atrium. A left basilar chest tube is unchanged in position. Multiple metallic left chest wall skin ___ are in place. Left lung postsurgical changes persist, including stable retrocardiac opacification which may be due to a combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid. There is a new small layering right pleural effusion with associated basilar atelectasis and consolidation. An enteric tube courses below the hemidiaphragm, its distal tip not visualized.
