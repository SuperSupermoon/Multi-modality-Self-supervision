The ET tube is approximately 2.5 cm from the carina. The right subclavian line is noted with tip in the expected region of the mid SVC. Compared to the most recent prior examination, there is similar appearance of the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours with no significant change in bibasilar opacities as well as pulmonary edema. Small left pleural effusion is again noted.
