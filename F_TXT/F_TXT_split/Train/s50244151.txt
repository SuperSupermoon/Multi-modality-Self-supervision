In comparison with the operative study of earlier in this date, the left IJ pacer wire has its tip in the region of the apex of the right ventricle. No evidence of pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends at least to the lower body of the stomach. Again there is substantial pulmonary edema with normal-appearing heart.
