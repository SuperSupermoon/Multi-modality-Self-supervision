Endotracheal tube and central venous catheter are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable when allowances are made for lower lung volumes and rotation. Worsening opacity at the left lung base may be due to a combination of atelectasis and effusion, but coexisting infectious consolidation is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Note is also made of worsening atelectasis at the right base and possible development of a small right pleural effusion. Moderate elevation of left hemidiaphragm is present with adjacent marked gastric distension in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
