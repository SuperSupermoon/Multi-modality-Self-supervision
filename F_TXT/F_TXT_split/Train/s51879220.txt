There is improved aeration at the left base, although persistent patchy opacity with associated layering effusion likely reflects residual atelectasis or resolving pneumonia. There is also improved aeration within the right lung possibly related to improved inspiration and resolving airspace disease. The right hilum appears somewhat prominent but when correlated with the recent chest CT of ___, this likely reflects a combination of small hilar lymph nodes and prominent vascular structures. The heart remains enlarged. No pneumothorax.
