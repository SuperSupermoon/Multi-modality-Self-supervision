As compared to the previous image, the extension of the pneumothorax has markedly increased. This is particularly evident at the left lung base. Here, the dimension of the pneumothorax is approximately 3-4 cm. Otherwise, there are no relevant changes. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position. Atelectasis at the right lung base is constant. Retrocardiac atelectasis. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.
