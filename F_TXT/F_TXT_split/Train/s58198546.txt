The left subclavian PICC line now crosses the midline and has its tip in distal right brachiocephalic vein near the confluence with the superior vena cava. Repositioning is advised. Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. Lungs are now better inflated with residual streaky opacities at the bases likely reflecting atelectasis. The heart is enlarged. Aorta is unfolded and tortuous. No pulmonary edema. Minimal blunted left costophrenic angle may reflect a tiny effusion.
