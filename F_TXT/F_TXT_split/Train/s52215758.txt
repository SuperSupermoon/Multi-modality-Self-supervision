Low lung volumes are present. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. Widening of the mediastinal contour is likely due to low lung volumes. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Small right pleural effusion is likely present along with patchy opacities in the lung bases, most likely due to atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
