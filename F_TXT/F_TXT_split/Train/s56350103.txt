As compared to the previous radiograph, the left pigtail catheter in the pleural space has been slightly advanced. There is no substantial change in the dimension of the left pneumothorax, that is best seen in the apicolateral aspects of the left hemithorax. Small air inclusions at the site of catheter insertion. Minimal flattening of the left hemidiaphragm. The appearance of the heart and the right lung are constant.
