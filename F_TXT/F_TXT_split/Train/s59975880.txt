The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valvular surgery. Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard position. Persistent widening of right mediastinal contour, similar in appearance to previous postoperative radiographs. Improving aeration in the right upper lobe with residual mild atelectasis remaining. Small pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis are unchanged. Linear lucency along right mediastinal border could reflect a medial pneumothorax, and less likely pneumomediastinum. This is unchanged since previous postoperative radiographs, with a right chest tube in place.
