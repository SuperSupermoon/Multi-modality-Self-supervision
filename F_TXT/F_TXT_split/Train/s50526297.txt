Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6.9 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube tip courses below the diaphragm, off the inferior border of the film. Heart size is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The hila are unremarkable. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced on the left, likely reflect atelectasis though aspiration is not excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine study. No grossly displaced fractures are visualized.
