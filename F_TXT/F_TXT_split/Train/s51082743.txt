As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of massive bilateral parenchymal opacities, diffusely distributed in the lungs, with multiple air bronchograms. The severity in extent of these changes is constant. No new parenchymal opacities. No larger pleural effusions. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the monitoring and support devices.
