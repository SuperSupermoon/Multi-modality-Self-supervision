Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Moderate enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette has minimally improved. There is no evident pneumothorax. Left chest tube and a second tube projecting over the heart are in unchanged position. Enlarged right pleural effusion is grossly unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient associated with adjacent atelectasis. A rounded radiolucency projecting in the right lower hemithorax is again noted, this could be due to air in the pleural space or aerated lung surrounding by atelectasis.
