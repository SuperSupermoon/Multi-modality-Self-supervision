A portable frontal view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. There is interval removal of the NG, ET and chest tubes. Multiple overlying structures in the right apex limit evaluation. Sternotomy wires appear intact. Right costophrenic angle is obscured, suggestive of small pleural effusion. There is no left pleural effusion. There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. Perihilar vascular congestion is present. Bilateral opacities with relative sparing of the upper lung zones persist. Pleural plaques and subpleural reticular opacities are better appreciated on prior CT. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip projects over confluence of right IJ and subclavian vein.
