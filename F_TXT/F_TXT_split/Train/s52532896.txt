An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. A left IJ central line is present, tip over mid SVC. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm off the film. No pneumothorax is detected. Compared to the prior film, again seen are focal relatively confluent opacities in the left lung laterally and in the right perihilar region, though no clear cut air bronchograms are identified. There is also upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is increased left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, now with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and a small left effusion. Probable atelectasis at the right lung base. Minimal opacity in the right costophrenic angle could represent either atelectasis or small amount of fluid. Spinal hardware noted.
