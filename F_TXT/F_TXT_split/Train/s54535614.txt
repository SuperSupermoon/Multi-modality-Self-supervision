The left lung base is densely opacified by a combination of pleural effusion and lower lobe collapse. Heterogeneous density in the right lower hemithorax is also likely a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. A large area of vaguely increased radiodensity in the right upper lobe is probably consolidation. Heart size is top-normal. There is no pneumothorax.
