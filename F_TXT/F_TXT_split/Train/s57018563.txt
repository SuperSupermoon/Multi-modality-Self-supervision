Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Left hemidiaphragm is somewhat obscured, although this may in part relate to underpenetration; however, there may be small pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. In addition, there is hazy opacity at the right mid-to-lower lung, likely relates to small-to-moderate pleural effusion seen on CT earlier today. Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes are better assessed on CT performed earlier today. Additionally, subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, also better assessed on CT.
