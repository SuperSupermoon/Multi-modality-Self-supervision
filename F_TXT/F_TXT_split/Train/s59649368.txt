Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Diffuse mild increase in interstitial markings bilaterally consistent with patient's history of chronic interstitial fibrosis. Slight prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature suggests a mild component of pulmonary vascular congestion. More focal opacity in the right upper to mid lung is stable and may relate to patient's underlying fibrosis/scarring. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette enlarged. No large pleural effusions are seen, although small effusions may be difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax.
