In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change. No evidence of pneumothorax related to the central catheter. The other monitoring and support devices are unchanged. As on the previous studies, there is prominence of the superior mediastinum. This may well reflect the portable technique and size of the patient. If there is any clinical suspicion for a position of the catheter outside of the vena cava, CT could be considered.
