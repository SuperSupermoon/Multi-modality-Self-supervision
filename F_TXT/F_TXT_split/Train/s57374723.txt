Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is a right subclavian central venous catheter which appears to terminate in the low SVC, without evidence of pneumothorax. Right base opacity is seen, worrisome for pneumonia. Underlying partial lower lung collapse is not excluded, although the right hemidiaphragm is not elevated. It will be difficult to exclude trace right pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The aorta is calcified. There appears to be central pulmonary vascular congestion.
