Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Previously noted nodular opacities primarily in an upper lobe distribution seen on CT are not clearly present on the current radiograph. Linear opacity in the left lower lobe is new, and may reflect chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. No new focal consolidation is otherwise present. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
