Again noted are median sternotomy wires, surgical ___, left-sided chest tube, double-lumen right IJ catheter, and left subclavian central venous catheter. Diffuse parenchymal opacities that likely reflect pulmonary edema are unchanged from ___. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly enlarged, but this may be due to lower lung volumes.
