Comparison is made with prior study performed eight hours earlier. There has been interval continuous progression of bibasilar opacities, on the left are consistent with atelectasis and pleural effusion on the right could be atelectasis, part of the pulmonary edema, but pneumonia cannot be totally excluded. Moderate cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema has improved. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard position.
