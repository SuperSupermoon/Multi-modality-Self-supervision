Monitoring and support devices including ET tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, left internal jugular central venous catheter, and partially visualized enteric tube are in stable position. The distal end of the Dobbhoff tube is not included in view. Patient positioning limits the evaluation. However, lung volumes remain low. Bilateral pleural effusions are not appreciably changed. Left retrocardiac opacity is re- demonstrated. There is no large pneumothorax. Tortuosity of the aortic arch is exaggerated by scoliosis.
