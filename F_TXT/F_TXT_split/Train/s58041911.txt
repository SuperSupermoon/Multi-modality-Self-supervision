AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. The heart size remains normal and no configurational abnormality is noted. The entire thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated, and this includes also the ascending portion to the right of the midline. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there are no signs of acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates. Also, the lateral pleural sinuses remain free from fluid accumulation and there is no pneumothorax in the apical area. Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for comparison.
