Severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated with similar mediastinal contours. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is slightly improved compared to the previous study. Moderate to large right pleural effusion which is loculated partially laterally appears increased from the previous study. Worsening opacification of right lung base may reflect atelectasis, however infection is not excluded. There is a small left pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified.
