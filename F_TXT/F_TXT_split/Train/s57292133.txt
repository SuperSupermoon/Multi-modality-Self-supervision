Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Left chest tube is in place although slightly repositioned. There is small left apical pneumothorax, slightly bigger than on the previous examination and might be related to repositioning of the left chest tube. Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Bibasal areas of atelectasis and small amount of pleural effusion is noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
