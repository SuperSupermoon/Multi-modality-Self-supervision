There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube with the tip 2.8 cm above the level of the carina. The nasoenteric catheter has also been placed and is below the diaphragm, though the tip is incompletely imaged. Lungs are clear without confluent consolidation. There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
