When compared to prior radiograph obtained 2 hr prior, there is been interval retraction of the endotracheal tube currently in approximately 4 cm above the level of the carina in appropriate position. A right central line terminates at the mid SVC. An enteric tube appears to terminate within the stomach. This can be advanced ___-15cm for more appropriate positioning. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged in appearance. Bilateral obscuration of the costophrenic angle suggests bilateral pleural effusions.
