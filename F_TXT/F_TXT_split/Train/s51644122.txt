A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Right basilar linear opacity may represent atelectasis or pneumonia. The remainder of the lungs is clear. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart size is normal allowing for patient position and technique. Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are within normal limits.
