Bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for supine technique and low lung volumes. Worsening opacities in both retrocardiac regions, probably represent atelectasis, but aspiration is an additional consideration. Unchanged left apical capping. No visible pneumothorax. Multifocal skeletal injuries are similar in appearance.
