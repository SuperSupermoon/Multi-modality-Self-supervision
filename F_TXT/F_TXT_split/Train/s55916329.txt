Bilateral asymmetrically distributed airspace opacities have rapidly improved, with residual opacities now most prominent in the right lower and left upper and mid lung regions. Considering rapid improvement and coexisting cardiomegaly and vascular engorgement, these findings likely represent asymmetrical pulmonary edema. Continued radiographic followup would be helpful to exclude other causes of airspace opacification such as pulmonary hemorrhage, aspiration, and infection.
