ET tube ends in the right main bronchus and should be withdrawn at least 4 cm for standard positioning. Nasogastric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung could be due to large scale aspiration. Careful followup advised. Heart size normal. Atelectasis in the left lung is mild. Subsequent to the chest radiograph, 16:57 showed repositioning of the ET tube at the carina.
