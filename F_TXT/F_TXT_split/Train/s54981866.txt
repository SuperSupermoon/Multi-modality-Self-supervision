AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are lower, which may exaggerate caliber of central vessels, but there looks to have been a substantial increase in pulmonary artery caliber suggesting worsening pulmonary hypertension. There are no radiographic abnormalities in the lungs to suggest pneumocystis pneumonia. Heart size is top normal but larger than it was early in this admission. Differential diagnosis of progressive pulmonary hypertension includes pulmonary emboli. Right PIC line ends low in the SVC.
