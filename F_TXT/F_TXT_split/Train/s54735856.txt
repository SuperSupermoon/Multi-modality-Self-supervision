In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, a discordancy that suggests cardiomyopathy or possibly even pericardial effusion. Left hemidiaphragm is not seen, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe with a small pleural effusion. Area of asymmetric opacification in the left perihilar region could be related to areas of ischemia related to the subsegmental pulmonary emboli seen on the CT scan of ___, or aspiration or infectious pneumonia.
