Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier. There are lower lung volumes, right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. Bibasilar opacities have increased consistent with increasing atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac size is obscured by the lung abnormalities and the low lung volumes. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
