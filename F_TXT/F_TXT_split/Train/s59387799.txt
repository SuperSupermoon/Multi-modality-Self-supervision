Shortly after the study, a preliminary interpretation was provided by Dr. ___ ___ stated "Improved aeration of the left lung base, minimal right-sided atelectasis. Otherwise, unchanged exam. No acute findings." The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including tortuosity of a calcified aorta. A central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium, also not significantly changed. Left basilar opacity has resolved. However, there is a new streaky right basilar opacity. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
