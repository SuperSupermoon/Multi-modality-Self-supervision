There is improving aeration within the right lung suggesting decrease in size of right-sided pleural effusion. Persistent parenchymal opacities within the right lung are consistent with persistent pneumonia. Interval appearance of retrocardiac consolidation may reflect aspiration, pneumonia or atelectasis. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax. Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position, although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not visible on the study. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
