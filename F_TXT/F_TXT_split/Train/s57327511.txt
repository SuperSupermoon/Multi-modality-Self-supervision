Endotracheal tube is 4.3 cm above the carina though likely further given the patient's kyphotic positioning. Nasogastric tube terminates in the proximal stomach. Right-sided Pleurx catheter is noted with persistent small left greater than right pleural effusions. Multifocal cavitary and non-cavitary sites of consolidation are seen with unchanged opacification of right upper lobe and left lower lobe compatible with ongoing infectious process.
