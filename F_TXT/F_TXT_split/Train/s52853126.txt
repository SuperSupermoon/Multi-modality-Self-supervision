Portable supine chest radiograph. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach. Endotracheal tube terminates 1.9 cm above the carina and should not be advanced any further. While it is likely in satisfactory position, it is difficult to ascertain on this image if the head is flexed or extended. The lungs are slightly low in volume. Multifocal interstitial and parenchymal abnormalities are nonspecific and could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema with a slight left-sided predominance. Fullness of the AP window and hila may reflect coexistent adenopathy, which could be confirmed with post-treatment radiographs. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is enlarged, particularly the left atrium given splaying of the carina.
