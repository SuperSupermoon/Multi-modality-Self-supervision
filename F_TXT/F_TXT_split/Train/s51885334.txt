AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Patient is intubated. The ETT is seen to terminate in the trachea 4 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax is identified in the apical area. An NG tube is seen reaching far below the diaphragm. Extensive diffuse haze exists on the lung bases and obliterates the contours of the diaphragms as well as major portion of the heart shadow. This finding most likely represents pleural effusion layering in the posterior and dependent portion of the pleural space in this semi-erect position patient. Heart shadow is difficult to assess but some cardiac enlargement is likely. A looping line is noted in the left-sided subclavian area. It could represent an abandoned subclavian line, but is possibly external. Another ellipsoid shaped structure is overlying the right upper lobe area but is most likely external. There is no conclusive evidence for any acute pulmonary discrete infiltrate of pneumonia type; however, such process cannot be excluded in the lower lung fields which are clouded by the diffuse pleural hazy density. A sharply delineated linear density on the right base represents the minor fissure which is slightly widened and confirms the assumption that the patient has pleural effusions.
