Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.4 cm above the level of the carina. There are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Opacity along the pleura bilaterally is stable and may relate to pleural fat. There may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Left basilar atelectasis is seen without definite focal consolidation. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are likely accentuated by low lung volumes and AP technique.
