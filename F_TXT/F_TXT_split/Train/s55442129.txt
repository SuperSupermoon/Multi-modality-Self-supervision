Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach though side port is just above the gastroesophageal junction and the tube should be advanced for optimal positioning. Lung volumes are slightly low. The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is mildly tortuous. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Hazy opacity within the right lung base likely reflects a trace right pleural effusion. Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No definite large right pneumothorax is present though assessment for left-sided pneumothorax is limited as the costophrenic angle is excluded. Fracture of the tenth posterior rib on the right is noted, and may be related to recent cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
