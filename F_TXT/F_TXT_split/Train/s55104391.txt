A new right internal central jugular venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava. There is no evidence for pneumothorax. The heart is again mild-to-moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. The patient is status post aortic valve replacement. Mild background pulmonary vascular congestion appears similar to somewhat increased, with a small right-sided pleural effusion that has a shifting distribution but is probably similar in size. Similar patchy lower lung opacities suggest minor atelectasis or scarring and appear similar. Focal nodular density projecting over the left lower lung suggests a nipple shadow that is unchanged.
