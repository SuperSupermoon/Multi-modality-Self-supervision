Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given the patient rotation on the current examination. The lungs appear well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia or aspiration. There is a small layering right effusion. The pulmonary vasculature is slightly less well defined and likely reflects interval development of mild interstitial edema. No pneumothorax.
