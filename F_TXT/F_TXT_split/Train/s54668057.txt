Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unremarkable. The bilateral pleural effusions are large, associated with bibasal consolidation. There is most likely no evidence of pulmonary edema and the ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs is due to layering pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Potential of pneumonia obscured by atelectasis and pleural effusion is real and thus close monitoring with chest radiographs is recommended.
