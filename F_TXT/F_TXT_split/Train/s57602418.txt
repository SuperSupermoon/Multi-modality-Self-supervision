Left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There are layering bilateral effusions with bibasilar opacities likely reflecting compressive lower lobe atelectasis. Overall, when compared to prior breast to studies from earlier in the day, the pulmonary edema has substantially improved. No pneumothorax.
