In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the nasogastric tube is in the upper stomach. The side-port appears to be just distal to the esophagogastric junction. Left IJ catheter again extends to the mid to lower portion of the SVC. Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
