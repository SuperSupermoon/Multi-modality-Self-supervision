The metallic pattern along the mid portion of a left brachiocephalic and subclavian stent shows irregularity along the mid portion of the stent where it crosses over the left first rib. This is probably due to an impression on the stent by the rib, but appears new since the prior CT, which was performed very shortly after placement. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. The lungs appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. There is similar mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
