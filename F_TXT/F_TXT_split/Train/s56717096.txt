AP chest compared to ___: Extensive pulmonary opacification, greater in the right lung, has progressed significantly since ___. Given moderate chronic cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement, this could be explained by asymmetric pulmonary edema or, since consolidation is much more pronounced in the right lung where there is even a nodular quality above the level of the minor fissure, this could be concurrent disseminated infection and pulmonary edema. Small right pleural effusion is presumed. There is no pneumothorax. Left subclavian line ends in the upper SVC.
