This study was performed as a chest x-ray. The Dobbhoff tube tip is off the film and is probably below the hemidiaphragm. The heart size is moderately enlarged and there is hazy alveolar infiltrate bilaterally with bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary vascular redistribution and perihilar haze. The overall impression is that of worsening CHF. The Dobbhoff tube position cannot be assessed.
