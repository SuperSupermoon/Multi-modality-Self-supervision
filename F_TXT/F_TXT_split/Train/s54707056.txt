Widespread consolidation in the left upper lobe appears similar, but comparing to the scout view from the prior examination, there is seemingly new retrocardiac opacification. In each lung, there is also a widespread new background hazy appearance; to some extent, this is probably be attributed to layering pleural effusions, which may have increased, versus worsening of multifocal pneumonia, coinciding fluid overload, or developing respiratory distress syndrome.
