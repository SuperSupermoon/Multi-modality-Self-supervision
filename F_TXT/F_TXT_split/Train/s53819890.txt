Left-sided vagal nerve stimulator is again seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is no definite focal consolidation. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to overlying soft tissue although a trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax is seen.
