Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Widened mediastinum is stable allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Cardiomegaly is also unchanged. Right central catheter tip is in the lower SVC. ET tube is seen in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. The stomach is very distended. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is stable. Mild left pleural effusion is stable.
