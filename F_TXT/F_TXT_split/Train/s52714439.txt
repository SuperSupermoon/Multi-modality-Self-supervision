Previously asymmetrically distributed opacification in the right lung base and upper lobe has improved, but interstitial abnormality has become considerably more extensive in the left lung and there is new consolidation at the base. The findings could be explained by asymmetric distribution of edema, but I favor aspiration, clearing from the right lung, now worsening on the left. Generalized hyperinflation is due to obstructive airways disease. Borderline cardiomegaly is stable. Pleural effusions if present are not large.
