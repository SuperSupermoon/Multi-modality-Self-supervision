No change since the last exam. The endotracheal tube is in adequate position. The right PICC line has been removed. The left subclavian line is also in adequate position. Slight worsening of the right loculated pleural effusion. No change of the ground-glass and alveolar diffuse opacities that were assessed in the CT scan done yesterday which is compatible with pulmonary edema. Cardiac contour and mediastinal contour unchanged.
