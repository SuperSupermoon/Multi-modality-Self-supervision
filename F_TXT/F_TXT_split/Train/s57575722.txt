There is a tracheostomy in place. An esophageal tube passes into the stomach, its inferior course not imaged. A right subclavian dual-lumen catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. A right-sided PIC line also terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs appear clear.
