AP chest compared to ___: On ___, patient had a worsened, moderate pulmonary edema and a larger moderate right pleural effusion as well as chronic severe cardiomegaly. Lungs improved somewhat over the subsequent five days, including today's examination. There could be a region of pneumonia in the axillary area of the left lung, since that area was always more deeply consolidated than the remainder of the lungs. If it is pneumonia, it is also improving. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. Marked rightward deviation of the trachea in the lower neck is presumably due to a thyroid mass. Left PIC line can be traced as far as the low SVC, but the tip is indistinct.
