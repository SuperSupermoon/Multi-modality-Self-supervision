Radiograph centered in the lower chest was obtained for assessment of a nasogastric tube, which terminates within the stomach. The sideport, however, is at or just above the GE junction level. Within the chest, heart is mildly enlarged but stable in size. Bibasilar patchy and linear opacities are present, right greater than left. These findings favor atelectasis but aspiration and infection should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also demonstrated. Healed left rib fracture is incidentally noted.
