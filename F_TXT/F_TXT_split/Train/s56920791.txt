Study is slightly limited by patient rotation. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with tip off the inferior borders of the film. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip is noted within the proximal right atrium. Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device leads terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable. Lung volumes are low with crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic. Patchy opacities within the lung bases, more so on the right, likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
