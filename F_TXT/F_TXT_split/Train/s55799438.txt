As compared to ___ radiograph, endotracheal tube has been advanced, with tip now terminating 2.2 cm above the carinal with the neck in a flexed position. Semi upright positioning limits comparison to the prior study, but moderate left pleural effusion may be slightly larger than on the prior exam. Bibasilar atelectasis is again demonstrated.
