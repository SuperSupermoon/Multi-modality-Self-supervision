AP portable supine view of the chest. The patient has been intubated with the endotracheal tube seen terminating 2.7 cm above the carina. The endogastric tube is seen extending into the left upper quadrant. Lung volumes are low with scattered areas of opacity appearing increased from prior likely reflecting atelectasis though a component of aspiration cannot be excluded. No supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No acute bony injuries.
