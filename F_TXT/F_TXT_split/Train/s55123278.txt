AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained earlier. Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip not included in the field of view. Right lower lung atelectasis and left retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged since the prior study. Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. There is no evidence of pneumothorax seen.
