Heart size is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The aorta remains tortuous. Low lung volumes cause crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, but no focal consolidation is present. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
