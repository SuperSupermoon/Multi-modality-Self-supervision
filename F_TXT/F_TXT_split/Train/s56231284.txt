As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a new plate-like atelectasis at the right lung base. Postoperative appearance of the mediastinum and the remaining right lung is unchanged. On the left, a pre-existing pleural effusion with subsequent partial atelectasis of the left lower lobe has slightly increased in extent and severity. To exclude developing pneumonia, short-term radiographic followup should be performed. No other relevant changes. The right chest tube remains in situ.
