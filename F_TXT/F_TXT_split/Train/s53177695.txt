Compared to the prior study, there is improved aeration; however, there continues to be volume loss/infiltrate/effusion in both lower lungs. There is small pulmonary vascular re-distribution and hazy alveolar infiltrate on the right. It is unclear how much of this is due to pulmonary edema. An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded. Heart size is moderately enlarged. ET tube, NG tube and hemodialysis catheter are unchanged.
