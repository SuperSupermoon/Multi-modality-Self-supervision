A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained. In comparison to the prior study, the cardiac silhouette has slightly increased in size and the pulmonary vasculature is less distinct with cephalization of the vessels, consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Previously noted interstitial changes at the bases are less prominent as a result of superimposed edema. No large effusion or pneumothorax.
