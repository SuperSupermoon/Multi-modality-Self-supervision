AP chest compared to ___: Previous left upper lobe collapse has resolved. Moderate cardiomegaly has increased, as has the caliber of pulmonary and hilar vasculature. New opacification in the right lower lung is probably atelectasis, but should be followed radiographically. Pleural thickening surrounds multiple healed fractures in the lateral right hemithorax. No pneumothorax.
