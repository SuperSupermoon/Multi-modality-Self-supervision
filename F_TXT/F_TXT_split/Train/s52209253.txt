Semi supine portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates interval retraction of an endotracheal tube which appears to terminate 3.8 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube descends the thorax in uncomplicated course, its tip below the level of the left hemidiaphragm incompletely imaged. Lung volumes are low with associated atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Central vascular crowding is likely sequela of low lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax. There is no large pleural effusion. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may reflect pleural thickening. There is no air under the right hemidiaphragm.
