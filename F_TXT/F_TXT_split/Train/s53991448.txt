There has been interval intubation with endotracheal tube tip projecting approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. An esophageal catheter courses below the diaphragm with tip projecting over the left upper quadrant, likely within the stomach. There is a large left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion, as seen previously, with underlying left lower lung consolidation. No pneumothorax is detected on this single supine view. Pulmonary vascular prominence persists without radiographic evidence for overt pulmonary edema. Heart size is difficult to evaluate in the setting of overlying pleural effusion.
