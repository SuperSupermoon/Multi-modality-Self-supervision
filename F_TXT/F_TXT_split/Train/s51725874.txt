Left PICC remains in place, with tip terminating in the region of the cavoatrial junction. Heart size is normal. Bilateral multifocal areas of consolidation with perihilar and upper lung predominance have slightly improved, but a confluent opacity at the right lung base has worsened. It is uncertain whether these findings are due to asymmetrical edema or multifocal infection. Small right pleural effusion is present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
