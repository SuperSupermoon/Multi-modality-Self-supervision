An endotracheal tube terminates just above the carina and should be pulled back 3-4 cm for ideal positioning. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. An enteric tube descends below the field of view, likely within the stomach. There is a persistent left basal opacity which suggests consolidation or atelectasis, minimally increased from the prior examination. There is minimal right basal atelectasis. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
