AP chest compared to ___ at 12:49 a.m.: Cardiomegaly is severe, both hila are enlarged, probably due to arterial dilatation from pulmonary hypertension. Left atrium is particularly dilated and there may be heavy mitral annulus calcification, but there is no indication of elevated pulmonary venous pressure, distended mediastinal veins, pulmonary edema or even appreciable pleural effusion. Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified, because of overlapping structures, I cannot assess whether the descending portion is dilated.
