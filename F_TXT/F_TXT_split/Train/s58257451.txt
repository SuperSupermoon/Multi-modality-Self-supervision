Allowing for differences in technique and positioning, there has been little overall change in the appearance of the chest except for worsening opacity in the left retrocardiac region, likely due to atelectasis and adjacent small effusion. Previously reported left basilar pneumothorax is not clearly seen, but the extreme lateral left costophrenic angle has been excluded from the radiograph, limiting assessment of this region.
