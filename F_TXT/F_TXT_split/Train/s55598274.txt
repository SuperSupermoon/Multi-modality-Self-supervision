An ET tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina. An enteric tube extends below the diaphragm and out of view. Normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Below the right hemidiaphragm there is a thin sliver of lucency laterally which may be artifactual; however, raises the possibility of free intraperitoneal air. Cholecystectomy clips are noted in the right upper quadrant. There is a healing subacute fracture of the left eighth rib laterally.
