Comparison is made with prior study, ___ and concurrent CT. Lines and tubes are in unchanged position. The ET tube is slightly high and can be advanced couple of centimeters for more standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with mild cardiomegaly. Large bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left side, are better seen on concurrent CT, decreased on the right from the day earlier. Left pneumothorax is difficult to visualize, better seen in concurrent CT. Extensive multifocal consolidations are unchanged.
