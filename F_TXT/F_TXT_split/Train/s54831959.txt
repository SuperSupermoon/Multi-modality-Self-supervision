1. Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. Right subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip in the mid to distal SVC. Overall lung volumes remain low and there is a bilateral patchy airspace disease which does not appear to be significantly changed given differences in positioning, technique and inspiration. These findings could be consistent with diffuse pneumonia and/or pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation is advised. Patient's mandible obscures the apices. No large pneumothorax is appreciated. There are probable small bilateral effusions. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the diffuse airspace process.
