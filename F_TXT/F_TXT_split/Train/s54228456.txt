This is a highly limited study due to technique and patient body habitus. Cardiac silhouette is massively enlarged. Lung volumes are persistently low with diffuse bilateral opacities with probable improvement of retrocardiac densities with increased aeration but with persistent right-sided and left apical indistinct opacity.
