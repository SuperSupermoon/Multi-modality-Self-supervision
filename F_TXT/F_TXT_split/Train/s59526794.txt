Near complete opacification of the left lung has progressed with increasing left-sided pleural effusion and further collapse of the left lung. The left lower lobe masslike opacity is unchanged an can be round atelectasis. There is crowding of the bronchovascular markings and mild pulmonary vascular congestion in the right lung. Endotracheal tube is 3 cm from the carina. The first side port of the nasogastric tube is at the gastroesophageal junction. In the right upper quadrant a TIPS catheter is noted.
