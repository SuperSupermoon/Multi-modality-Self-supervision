Lordotic positioning. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal ,with a left ventricular configuration. The aorta is slightly unfolded and tortuous. There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. There is some patchy retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, though, for the most part, the left hemidiaphragm remains visible. There is minimal blunting of left and ? right costophrenic angles. Compared with earlier the same day at 4:48 a.m. and allowing for differences in positioning, opacity at the left base and blunting of the left costophrenic angle has progressed. Mild pulmonary vascular plethora has decreased.
