There is again seen a right-sided PICC line whose distal lead tip is poorly seen but appears to be in the proximal right atrium. There are markedly low lung volumes which limits evaluation. Atelectasis at the lung bases is seen. No pneumothoraces are identified. Severe degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joints are present.
