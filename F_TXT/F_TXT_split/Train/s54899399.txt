Interval placement of left internal jugular central venous catheter with tip terminating in the region of the lower superior vena cava with no evidence of pneumothorax. Allowing for marked leftward patient rotation, cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. New patchy and linear opacities have developed in the left retrocardiac region and may reflect patchy atelectasis, aspiration or an early focus of pneumonia. Repeat radiograph with improved positioning would be helpful for further evaluation.
