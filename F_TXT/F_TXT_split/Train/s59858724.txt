Endotracheal tube tip is 2 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is in the stomach. A shunt is seen overlying the right chest. Left central line tip is in the SVC. There is new opacification at the left base which could represent effusion, atelectasis or possibly consolidation. Mucous plugging should also be included in the differential as there appears to be an abrupt transition of the left mainstem bronchus approximately 4 cm from the carina.
