Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate interval removal of two chest tubes, ET tube, NG tube, and right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter. There is no pneumothorax or other sign of complications. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen, left greater than right. There is also a left pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette is slightly increased in size since prior imaging, consistent with recent extubation. Sternotomy wires are again visualized. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
