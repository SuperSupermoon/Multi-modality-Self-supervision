Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is a very tiny right apical pneumothorax near the tip of the right-sided chest tube. No pneumothorax on the left side is seen. There is again seen unchanged diffuse consolidation throughout both lung fields, more confluent in the left mid and lower lung fields. The lines and tubes appear stable in position and appropriately sited.
