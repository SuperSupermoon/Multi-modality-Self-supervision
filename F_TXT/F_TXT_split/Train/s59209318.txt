The heart remains markedly enlarged status post median sternotomy. Although this may represent cardiomegaly, a pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. A single lead left-sided pacer is unchanged in position. Interval placement of a right subclavian PICC line which has its tip in the mid SVC with removal of the left internal jugular central line. Stable moderate pulmonary edema. Probable layering left effusion with retrocardiac consolidation favoring compressive lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax.
