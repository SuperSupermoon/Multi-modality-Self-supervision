AP portable upright view of the chest. Hardware is partially visualized in the lumbar spine. Lung volumes are low. There is a retrocardiac opacity which is compatible with known large hiatal hernia as seen on prior CT. There are bibasilar opacities which may represent atelectasis, difficult to exclude an early pneumonia. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Mild central congestion is likely present without frank pulmonary edema. Bony structures appear demineralized though grossly intact. A chronic appearing right humeral head deformity is noted.
