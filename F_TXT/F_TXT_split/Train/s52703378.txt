The patient has had recent mitral valve repair. Two right chest tubes remain in place. Moderate pulmonary edema has slightly decreased. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is also unchanged. Mediastinal contours are stable. There is no definite pneumothorax. Increased obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is likely due to worsening atelectasis.
