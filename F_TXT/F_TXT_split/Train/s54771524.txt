As compared to previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The other monitoring and support devices are unchanged. As a consequence of extubation, the lung volumes have decreased and the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal basal opacities appear denser than before. However, no new opacities are visible. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. Minimal fluid overload cannot be excluded. No larger pleural effusions, no pneumothorax.
