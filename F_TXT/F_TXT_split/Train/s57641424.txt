As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the endotracheal tube, a venous introduction sheath on the right, a right Swan-Ganz catheter, a nasogastric tube and drainage devices over the liver are all unchanged. The lung volumes have minimally increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressure. However, atelectatic areas are still seen at the lung bases, both on the left and on the right. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild fluid overload. No evidence of pneumothorax.
