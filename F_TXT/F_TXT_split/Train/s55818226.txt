Left PICC terminates in the left brachiocephalic/SVC junction/proximal SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of view. Low lung volumes persist. Right lung opacity persists which could in part be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema and/ or layering pleural effusion although underlying consolidation is not excluded. Small to moderate right pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
