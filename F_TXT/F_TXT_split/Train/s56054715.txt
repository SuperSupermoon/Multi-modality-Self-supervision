In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained approximately 3 hours prior, there has been interval placement of an enteric tube, which passes into the stomach and outside the field of view. The ET tube tip terminates approximately 4.5 cm above the carina with the chin flexed. A left-sided PICC terminates in the lower SVC and a right-sided port and central venous catheter terminating near the superior cavoatrial junction. Small, bilateral pleural effusions decreased in size. Mild pulmonary edema has resolved. Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes otherwise unchanged.
