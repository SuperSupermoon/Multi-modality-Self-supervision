Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is tortuous. Atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob are present. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacity in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Remote left-sided rib fractures are present. Partially imaged are posterior fusion rods spanning the thoracolumbar spine. No subdiaphragmatic free air is present.
