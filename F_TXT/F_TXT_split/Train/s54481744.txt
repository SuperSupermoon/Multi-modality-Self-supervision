In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been replacement of the endotracheal tube, with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. There has been substantial improvement in the opacification at the right base, though this still reflects some combination of pleural fluid and volume loss in the right lower lung. Remainder the study is unchanged.
