As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of a right upper lobe opacity. This opacity can present non-recent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. No other changes, non-calcified granuloma at the right lung base. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, but no evidence of pulmonary edema.
