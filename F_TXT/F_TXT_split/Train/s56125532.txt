A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. The exam is limited by AP technique and poor penetration. The tip of a right internal jugular catheter is near the confluence of the internal jugular and brachiocephalic veins. Mediastinal drains are incompletely visualized. Median sternotomy wires are intact. There is increased aeration of the right upper lobe. The right minor fissure remains minimally elevated suggesting persistent right upper lobe volume loss. There is a small amount of edema and/or atelectasis in the right minor fissure. Moderate atelectasis and effusion are present at the left base. Post-operative mediastinal widening is improving. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.
