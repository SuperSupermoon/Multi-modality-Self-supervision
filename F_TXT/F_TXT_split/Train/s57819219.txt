Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. A left internal jugular central line and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. There are patchy opacities within both lower lungs which would be concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. In addition, there are layering effusions. Overall, the lungs are hyperinflated suggesting underlying emphysema. No pneumothorax. Deformity of several of the right upper posterior ribs is again seen likely related to old trauma.
