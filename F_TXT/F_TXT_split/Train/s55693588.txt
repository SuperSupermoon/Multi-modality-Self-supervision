Lung volumes are low. There is some overlying motion limiting evaluation of the lung parenchyma. However, there is increasing patchy retrocardiac opacity, which in the setting of low lung volumes, may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration and pneumonia should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Interposition of the colon under the right hemidiaphragm consistent with Chiladiti's. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient rotation on the current study.
