The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Opacification at the left lung base may represent layering pleural effusion versus atelectasis. The right lung is clear. Fractures of the left seventh through ninth posterolateral ribs are again identified. Deformities of the right ribs may represent old fractures. There is no pneumothorax. Prominent costochondral calcifications are noted. Calcification of the aorta is consistent with atherosclerosis.
