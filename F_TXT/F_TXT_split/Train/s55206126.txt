A fiducial marker is seen projecting over the right upper quadrant, likely in the medial aspect of the right lung base. Nodular opacities are noted in the left lung as seen on prior CT. Lung volumes are low which accentuates heart size. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax present.
