Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump is 15 mm from the aortic apex, 15 mm above standard placement. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal widening is probably due to venous engorgement and Pulmonary vascular engorgement suggest biventricular cardiac decompensation. There is, as yet, no pulmonary edema.
