Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in place, unchanged in position except for a nasogastric tube, with distal tip coiling in the upper stomach and directed cephalad. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Widespread combined alveolar and interstitial pattern affecting the left lung to a greater degree than the left is again demonstrated, with overall worsening of opacities in the right upper lobe. Right middle and right lower lobes are involved to a lesser degree than the remainder of the lungs. The serial changes in the right lung are concerning for spread of known left lung pneumonia into the right lung. Coexisting ARDS is also possible. Moderate left pleural effusion is again demonstrated, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
