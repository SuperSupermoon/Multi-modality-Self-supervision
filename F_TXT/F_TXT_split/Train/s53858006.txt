Compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing opacity at the right lung base, likely to reflect aspiration or atelectasis. Otherwise, the appearance of the lung parenchyma, including moderate fluid overload, is unchanged. Finally, the size of the cardiac silhouette and the moderate left pleural effusion is also unchanged. No other changes.
