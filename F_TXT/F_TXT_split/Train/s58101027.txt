Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 7 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach. Lung volumes are low. Cardiac silhouette size remains moderate to severely enlarged, as seen previously. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour is likely due to a combination of low lung volumes, supine technique, and AP positioning. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis superimposed on a chronic interstitial abnormality. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. Moderate degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
