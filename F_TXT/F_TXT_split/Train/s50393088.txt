In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, with the side hole at about the esophagogastric junction. The tube should be pushed forward several cm. Right IJ catheter tip remains in the region of the mid portion of the SVC. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or enlarged with evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure and bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the base. Vague suggestion of a more coalescent area of opacification in the right mid zone laterally, which could reflect a developing consolidation. In any event, it would be difficult to detect a superimposed pneumonia in the presence of such extensive changes in the lungs as well as the absence of a lateral view.
