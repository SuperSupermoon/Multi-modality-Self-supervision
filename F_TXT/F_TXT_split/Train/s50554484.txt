Chest x-ray from ___ at 3:36 a.m. Compared with the prior film, there has been improvement in CHF findings. There is mild residual vascular plethora. No frank consolidation or gross effusion. Allowing for technical differences, the cardiac silhouette is unchanged, mildly enlarged, with slight unfolding of the aorta. Upper zone redistribution again noted.
