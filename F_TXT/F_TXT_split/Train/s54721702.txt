As compared to the previous radiograph, new bilateral parenchymal opacities at the lung periphery, right more than left, have developed. The distribution and the pattern of the opacities suggests pneumonia. Pre-existing opacities, notably at the left lung base, are more extensive than on the previous image, suggesting underlying pulmonary edema. The tracheostomy tube and the right PICC line are in unchanged position.
