1. Retraction of minor fissure suggests atelectasis in the right upper zone, of uncertain etiology. 2. Probable atelectasis both lung bases, with low lung volumes. Early infectious infiltrate or aspiration pneumonitis is considered less likely, but remains in the differential. 3. Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular markings, likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. 4. Recommend repeat assessment after resolution of acute symptom with chest x-ray obtained with good inspiration, to better assess the cardiomediastinal silhouette and lung bases and to assess for any persistence of the right upper zone atelectasis.
