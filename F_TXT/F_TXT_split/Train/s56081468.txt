CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. Compared with ___ at 18:42 p.m., I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is a chest tube over the right lung. No pneumothorax is detected. Minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region and slight eventrated contour of the right hemidiaphragm are unchanged. The left lung is grossly clear, without CHF, consolidation or effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and right paratracheal soft tissues are unchanged.
