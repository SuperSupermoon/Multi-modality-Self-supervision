Comparison is made with prior study ___. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. ET tube tip is in standard position 6.4 cm above the carina. Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are stable. Right subclavian catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction or upper right atrium. There is no pneumothorax. Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side, are a combination of small effusions and adjacent atelectasis. Left perihilar atelectases are unchanged. There is mild stable vascular congestion.
