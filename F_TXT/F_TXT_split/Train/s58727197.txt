AP view of the chest demonstrates interval increase in opacification of the right lung, which likely represents combination of pleural fluid and patient's known right lung mass. Small portion of the right lung remains aerated in the lower lung zone, with increased opacification, likely due to overlying fluid. The left lung is essentially clear. Ill-defined opacity in the left upper lung likely corresponds to FDG-avid nodule seen on ___ PET-CT exam. There is no left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. There is no mediastinal shift. Heart size is normal.
