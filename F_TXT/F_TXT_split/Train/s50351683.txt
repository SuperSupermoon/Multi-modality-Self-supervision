As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. Size of the cardiac silhouette is also unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusions might be present, causing a minimal decrease in radiolucency of the left and right hemithorax. The remaining minimal bilateral opacities are also consistent with unchanged mild fluid overload. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
