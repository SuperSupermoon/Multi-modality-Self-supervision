There is little change compared to earlier same day radiograph with persistent small to moderate right-sided pleural effusion, bibasilar atelectasis, dependent interstitial edema particularly in the left lung base, emphysema and unchanged position of a right subclavian central venous catheter. Right internal jugular catheter appears slightly caudal compared to prior exam with the tip projecting over the cavoatrial junction.
