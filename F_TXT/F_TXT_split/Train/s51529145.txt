The patient is scoliotic and rotated to his left. The lung volumes are adequate on the right, but decreased on the left. The retrocardiac opacity, seen on prior chest x-ray, has improved. This opacity could represent a consolidation from infectious causes or an opacification due to atelectasis. There is a minimal left pleural effusion. The right costophrenic angle is unremarkable. The heart size and mediastinal vasculature is less apparent, likely reflecting improved congestion.
