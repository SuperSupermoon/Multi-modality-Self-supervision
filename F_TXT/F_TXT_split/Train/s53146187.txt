In comparison with the study of ___, the study is limited by scatter radiation related to the size of the patient. There is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube appears to coil within the upper stomach. The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in this patient with mitral valve replacement and intact midline sternal wires. Retrocardiac opacification with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable layering pleural effusion. The right lung is essentially clear.
