Orogastric tube tip and side-port are within the stomach. The endotracheal tube and right-sided Port-A-Cath remain in unchanged positions. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with atherosclerotic calcification noted at the aortic arch. Cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature is likely due to supine positioning. Minimal atelectasis is seen in the lung bases. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
