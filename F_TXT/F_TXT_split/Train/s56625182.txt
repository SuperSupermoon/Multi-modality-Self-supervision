Moderate right pneumothorax is little changed at the apex, again extending the fifth posterior rib, however, there is increased air seen laterally at the right lung base. Additionally, previously present though retrospectively increased in conspicuity is a coexistent small-moderate left pneumothorax, seen at the apex, medially, and at the left base. Bilateral pleural effusions persist, less conspicuous likely due to positioning. There is no new parenchymal opacity. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
