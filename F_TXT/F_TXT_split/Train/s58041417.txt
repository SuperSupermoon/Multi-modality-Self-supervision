There is a new pigtail catheter which has been placed since the prior study. There is a small pneumothorax. The apical visceral pleural edge measures approximately 2.5 cm from the apex of the chest wall. A moderate pleural effusion has developed where as only a very small fluid component was present previously. For the most part the right lung remains clear although it is possible that there may be some degree of atelectasis at the right lung base in association with the effusion. The left lung remains clear.
