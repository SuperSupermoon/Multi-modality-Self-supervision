A left-sided pacemaker/defibrillator is seen with 2 leads in appropriate position. Sternotomy wires and vascular clips are projected over the mediastinum. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The heart is top-normal in size. There is a small pleural effusion on the left as well as adjacent pulmonary opacities which could represent atelectasis or pneumonia. The right lung appears clear except for linear right basilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax identified. Left apical thickening.
