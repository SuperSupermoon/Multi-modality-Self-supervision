In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, especially prominent at the right base. This is consistent with a substantial layering effusion and underlying atelectasis or, in the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia. The pulmonary vessels are engorged and poorly defined, consistent with developing pulmonary vascular congestion. The endotracheal tube appears to have been removed. Otherwise, the monitoring and support devices remain in place.
