Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right chest tube is in place. The apical air collection appears to be minimally enlarged since the prior study. Basal opacity is unchanged. Left lung is well aerated. The mediastinal contour is overall unchanged, but there is increase in the thickness between the right margin of the mediastinum and the trachea, currently 3 cm as compared to 1.6 cm back on ___ radiograph. When compared to most recent radiographs from ___, the thickness appears to be unchanged. Continued surveillance of this area to exclude the possibility of expanding hematoma is required as well as to exclude the possibility of right middle lobe torsion (unlikely, but cannot be excluded). Alternatively, chest CT for precise assessment of this area might be considered as well.
