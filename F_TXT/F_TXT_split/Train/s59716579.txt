Lung volumes are low. Elevation of left hemidiaphragm is unchanged. Heart size is mildly enlarged, but potentially accentuated due to low lung volumes. Mediastinal contour is similar. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but without overt pulmonary edema. Linear opacities within the left lung base likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion is identified although the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. No pneumothorax is clearly seen.
