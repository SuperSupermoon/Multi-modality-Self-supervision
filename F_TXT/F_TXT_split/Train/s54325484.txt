Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates peripheral wedge-shaped opacification in the left upper lobe, consistent with a small amount of post-procedural hemorrhage after recent EBUS. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The right lung is grossly clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
