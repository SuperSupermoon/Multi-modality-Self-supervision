Moderate right and small left pleural effusion have been present for several days, not resolving. Bibasilar opacification in the lungs is most commonly due to atelectasis, but pneumonia is not excluded. Heart size is top-normal. ET tube, left subclavian catheter, an transesophageal drainage tube are all in standard placements. No pneumothorax.
