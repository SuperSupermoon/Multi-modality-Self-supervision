Lung volumes remain decrease in the right lung. There are bilateral chest tubes in-situ. The medial portion of the right chest tube is difficult to visualize. There has been an interval decrease in the right-sided pleural effusion however. No pneumothorax seen. A right subclavian and right internal jugular catheter are unchanged in appearance when compared to the prior study. An endotracheal tube and two nasoenteric tubes are also unchanged. Airspace opacity adjacent to the right heart border likely reflects atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
