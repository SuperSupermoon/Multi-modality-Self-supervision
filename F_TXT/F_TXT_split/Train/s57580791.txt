There is no visible pneumothorax. The right pleural effusion has decreased significantly post-thoracocentesis. There is still a very mild residual pleural effusion. The right lung mass is seen at the right upper lobe and there is a convexity of the right hilum compatible with the lymphadenopathies seen on the CT scan. The left lung is unremarkable. The mediastinal and cardiac contour are unchanged.
