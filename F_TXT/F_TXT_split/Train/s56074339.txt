Right-sided PICC now terminates in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. Endotracheal and enteric tubes are stable in position. There are relatively low lung volumes. Medial right mid lung opacity, slightly increased, may be due to atelectasis. Persistent left base opacity appears slightly improved.
