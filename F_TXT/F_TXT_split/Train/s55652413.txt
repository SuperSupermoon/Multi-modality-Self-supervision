1. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip coiled in the stomach. Left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction, unchanged. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina, unchanged. There is persistent layering right effusion with associated patchy airspace process, likely representing a component of compressive atelectasis. Overall, the diffuse bilateral airspace process has improved suggesting resolving, but persistent pulmonary and interstitial edema. Probable small left effusion, which appears slightly decreased when compared to the prior study of ___. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
