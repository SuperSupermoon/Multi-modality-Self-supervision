As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position, with exception of a removal of a right internal jugular vein catheter. The position of the endotracheal tube is constant with the tube projecting approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. Moderate cardiomegaly, left pleural effusion, left and right basal atelectasis and mild fluid overload persist.
