1. Left subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip in the mid-to-distal SVC. There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central line with its tip in the mid-to-distal SVC. The endotracheal tube is unchanged in position, having its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. There has been interval appearance of near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax with only a minimal residual portion of aerated lung at the left apex. A left basilar pleural catheter does remain in place. However, the findings would favor lobar collapse due to mucus plugging or accumulation of pleural fluid or hemorrahge. Clinical correlation is advised. The right lung remains inflated and is without evidence of focal airspace consolidation. No right-sided pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours can not be assessed given diffuse opacification of the left hemithorax. The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG.
