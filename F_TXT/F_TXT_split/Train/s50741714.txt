Single portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates stable severe cardiomegaly with interval increase in perihilar opacifications consistent with increased pulmonary edema. Slightly more focal opacification projecting over the right mid lung may reflect superimposed infection. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis present. Slightly increased collapse of the right middle lobe compared to next preceding study.
