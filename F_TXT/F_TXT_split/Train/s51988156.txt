The left hemidiaphragm continues to be elevated. However, there is some increased volume loss in the left lower lobe and a small left effusion. There is improved aeration in the right upper lobe, but some patchy areas of alveolar infiltrate have developed bilaterally. It is unclear if this is due to pulmonary edema or if an infectious process is present. Tracheostomy tube is unchanged. The low lung volume slightly limits this examination. It is unclear how much of these changes are actually due to low lung volumes.
