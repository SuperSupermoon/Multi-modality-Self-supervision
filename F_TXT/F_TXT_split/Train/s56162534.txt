As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, intra-aortic balloon pump has been repositioned, now proximal to the left main stem bronchus. The Swan-Ganz catheter is projecting in the right pulmonary artery, the device should be pulled back by approximately 3 cm. ET tube terminates 4 cm above the carina. Lung volumes remain low. Slight blunting of the left hemidiaphragm could be attributed to volume loss and a small effusion. Opacification of the right lung base could reflect atelectasis, however, in the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia should also be considered.
