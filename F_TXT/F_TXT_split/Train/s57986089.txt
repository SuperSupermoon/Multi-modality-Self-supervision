As compared to the previous radiograph, it appears as if the ventricular lead was pulled back. On the current image, the lead projects in a much more proximal location. However, it could still be located in the right ventricle. For more precise assessment, an additional lateral view should be provided. The atrial lead is in unchanged position. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pneumothorax, no pleural effusion.
