Compared with ___:50, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen are sternotomy wires, including a fractured uppermost sternotomy wire, and mediastinal clips. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, but no other evidence for CHF. There is minimal linear atelectasis and/or scarring at the left lung base, unchanged. No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia. No frank consolidation or effusion. No pneumothorax detected. Right-sided central line tip overlies the distal SVC, similar to the prior film.
