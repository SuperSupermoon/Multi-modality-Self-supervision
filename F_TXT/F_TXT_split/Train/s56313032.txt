As compared to ___, the current AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates new right upper lobe consolidation that might potentially represent interval development of pneumonia or aspiration. Some degree of atelectasis is also present in the right upper lobe process. There is also a new, at least partial, right middle lobe atelectasis. Minimal amount of basal atelectasis is noted on the left. Small amount of pleural effusion is most likely present. There is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax. Drain and surgical sutures are projecting over the left upper quadrant that are most likely consistent with recent nephrectomy.
