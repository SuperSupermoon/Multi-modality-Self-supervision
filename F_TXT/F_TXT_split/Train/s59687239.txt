In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside facility, there are somewhat lower lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence of vascular congestion. Left lung is clear. On the right, there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour with dense linear opacification above it. This could again represent the elevation of the right hemidiaphragm as seen previously with an atelectatic band above it. However, there is now blunting of the costophrenic angle, raising the possibility of some associated pleural fluid. If the condition of the patient permits, a lateral view could better assess whether there has been significant volume loss in the right lower lobe. .
