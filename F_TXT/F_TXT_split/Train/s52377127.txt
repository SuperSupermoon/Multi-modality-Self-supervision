Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. Hilar contours are unremarkable and the known left lesion seen on prior CT is not well seen on the current exam. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Continued streaky and patchy opacity within the left lung base likely reflects mild postobstructive atelectatic changes, not substantially changed in the interval. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Emphysematous changes are again noted within the lung apices. There is minimal atelectasis in the right lung base. Degenerative changes are noted within the imaged thoracic spine. Amorphous calcification adjacent to the lateral aspect of the right humeral head may reflect calcific tendinopathy.
