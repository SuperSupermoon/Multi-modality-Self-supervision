1. Right-sided pacer remains in place. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stably enlarged given differences in patient positioning and rotation. There has been interval improvement in the mild pulmonary edema with residual vascular congestion and patchy opacities at both bases which are slightly less consolidative favoring resolving edema. Probable layering left effusion and possibly a smaller effusion on the right. No pneumothorax.
