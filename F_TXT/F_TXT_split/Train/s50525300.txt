Marked clearing of the left lung relative both to the right lung today and its appearance yesterday suggests that there was edema in the lung that has substantially cleared. The persistent now perihilar consolidation in the right lung raises concern for focal conditions such as pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage before we can attributed to unilateral edema. Both findings could be explained by redistribution of edema if the patient has been in prolonged right cubitus positioning. Therefore clinical correlation is important. Lung volumes have improved and may contribute to the apparent decrease in mediastinal venous caliber. Heart is only top-normal size. No pneumothorax. Tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than a 0.5 cm above the carina and it should be advanced 4 cm for more secure seating. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper part of the nondistended stomach. Tip of the right PIC line is probably in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
