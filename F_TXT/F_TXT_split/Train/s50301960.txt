Portable upright frontal view of the chest. A dual-chamber cardiac pacer is present. There is moderate cardiomegaly, and an unfolded, slightly tortuous aorta. There are coarse increased interstitial markings throughout both lung bases, consistent with mild interstitial edema. There is no overt pulmonary edema. Kerley B lines are noted and could reflect chronic CHF. Increased retrocardiac density may represent a combination of atelectasis and CHF findings. No definite focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Incidental note made of soft tissue anchor over left humeral head.
