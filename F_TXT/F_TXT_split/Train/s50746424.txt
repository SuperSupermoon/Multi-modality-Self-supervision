AP portable upright view of the chest. A right thoracostomy tube is present. An orogastric tube terminates just above the diaphragm. There is no pneumothorax. Bibasilar linear opacities are most compatible with atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. A left retrocardiac opacity remains unchanged. The findings are minimally changed since the prior examination.
