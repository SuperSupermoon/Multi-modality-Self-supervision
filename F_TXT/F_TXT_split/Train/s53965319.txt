Chest radiograph obtained for assessment of nasogastric tube placement demonstrates a nasogastric tube terminating in the stomach with side port below the level of the gastroesophageal junction. As compared to the recent chest radiograph from earlier the same date, pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by minimal interstitial edema. Bilateral pleural effusions are again demonstrated, with interval improvement on the right and apparent slight worsening on the left. Positional differences may contribute to these apparent changes.
