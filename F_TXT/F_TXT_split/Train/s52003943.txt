Left subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates in the lower SVC. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Linear opacities in the right mid and lower lung fields, as well as the left lung base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Previously demonstrated FDG avid right lower lobe pulmonary nodule is better assessed on the recent PET-CT. Clips are noted projecting over the right hemidiaphragm. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
