There is no pneumothorax post-biopsy. The right PICC line has been removed since prior exam and there is a right Port-A-Cath ending in the lower SVC. Right lower lung opacity has increased: this most likely representa hemorrhage secondary to lung biopsy. The other lung opacities mostly in right lung but also in the left lower lung are stable. Mediastinal widening compatible with lymph node enlargement is stable. There is no significant pleural effusion.
