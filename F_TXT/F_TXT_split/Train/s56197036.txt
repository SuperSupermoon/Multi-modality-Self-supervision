An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating just below the level of the thoracic inlet. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. A right subclavian approach central venous catheter is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the mid SVC. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated in the setting of retrocardiac opacification and silhouetting of the right heart border and bilateral hemidiaphragms. The mediastinal contours appear prominent, which is likely related in part to technique, but appears stable since ___. There has been gradual increased opacification at the right lung base over multiple recent prior studies dating back to ___. There is silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm. Retrocardiac opacification is also increased over prior studies with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Small bilateral pleural effusions are greater on the right than the left. No pneumothorax is present.
