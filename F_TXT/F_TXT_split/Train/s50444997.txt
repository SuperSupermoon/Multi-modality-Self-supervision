In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the monitoring and support devices. Substantial bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the right with bibasilar atelectasis. Unusual configuration to the collection of opacification at the left base raises the possibility of some loculated fluid. There is again evidence of increased pulmonary venous pressure. Overlapping structures somewhat obscure visualization of the left upper zone and simulate the appearance of cavitary process. This area should be closely checked on subsequent radiographs.
