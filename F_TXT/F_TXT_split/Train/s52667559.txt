Continued bibasilar opacifications are consistent with pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. Given the pulmonary changes, it would be impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
