There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube. An esophageal catheter courses below the diaphragm with tip out of view. Left subclavian catheter appears similarly positioned. Sternal wires and cervical spine hardware appear similarly positioned on this frontal view. There is slightly improved aeration at the right lung base. Hazy opacification of the right lower lung field is likely secondary to pleural fluid. No pneumothorax is detected. Heart and mediastinal contours are stable.
