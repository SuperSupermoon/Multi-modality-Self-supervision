An endotracheal tube is in unchanged expected position with the tip positioned 5.2 cm above the level of the carina. There has been interval placement of a nasoenteric catheter, which courses below the diaphragm and is at least within the stomach, though the tip is incompletely imaged. Overall aeration of the lungs is slightly worse compared to prior examination and is compatible with severe pulmonary edema. No post-procedural pneumothorax is evident.
