Persistent widening of right paratracheal stripe, consistent with known lymph node enlargement in this region on prior CT. Additional calcified lymph nodes are seen in the subcarinal region and and are seen to better detail on the recent CT scan. Heart size is normal. Within the lungs, note is again made of a discrete nodule in the right upper lobe measuring approximately 2 cm. Lungs are otherwise clear, and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
