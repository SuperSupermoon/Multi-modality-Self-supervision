Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Midline tracheostomy tube is again seen. There are low lung volumes. There are mild perihilar and right lower lung opacities, decreased from the prior study. The perihilar opacification may relate to fluid overload, although more confluent opacity at the right lung base could be due to infection or aspiration. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable as compared to ___ with the cardiac silhouette top normal to mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by AP technique.
