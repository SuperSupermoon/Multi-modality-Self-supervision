Lung are volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear probably unchanged although cardiac borders are obscured by recurrent nearly confluent opacity involving the mid to left lower lung. A new opacity in the right upper lobe suggests pneumonia. Volume loss has actually improved somewhat in the right lower lung, probably encroaching on the right middle lobe. Small subpulmonic effusions are not excluded.
