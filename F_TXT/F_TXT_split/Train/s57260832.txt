Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. Right chest tube has been removed. There is evident pneumothorax. Widened mediastinum and apparent abnormal contour of the cardio-mediastinum is due to the projection of the study that is craniocaudal. In the prior study, the cardiomediastinal silhouette was within normal limits. Increased opacities in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe could be due to worsening atelectasis, but aspiration / infection cannot be excluded. Close followup is recommended. Right lower lobe atelectasis is grossly unchanged. There are no enlarging pleural effusions. Subcutaneous emphysema is stable.
