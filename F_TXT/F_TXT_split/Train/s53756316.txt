Right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. The lungs remain hyperinflated and there is parenchymal distortion suggestive of underlying emphysema with bullous changes involving both apices. There is improving aeration in the right mid-to-lower lung suggesting resolving pneumonia or aspiration or pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation is advised. The pulmonary arteries remain enlarged, suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. No pneumothorax.
