Single portable semi-erect AP view of the chest was obtained. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with overlying atelectasis, lucency underlying the right hemidiaphragm could be within bowel; however, there is concern for free air. There is also evidence of partially-imaged dilated small bowel projecting over the right abdomen. There are areas of atelectasis/scarring in the left mid-to-lower lung. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The mediastinum is shifted to the left, likely due to the elevated right hemidiaphragm and the cardiac silhouette may be enlarged, although the right aspect of the cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the elevated right hemidiaphragm. The aorta is calcified.
