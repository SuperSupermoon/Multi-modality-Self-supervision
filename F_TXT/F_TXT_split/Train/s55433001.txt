There are also numerous rib fractures. There is a chest tube on the left side with distal tip at the apex. There is an enteric tube whose tip and side port are below the GE junction. Endotracheal tube tip is appropriately sited, 3.5 cm above the carina. There is no pneumothoraces. Heart size is upper limits of normal but stable. There is increased opacity at the right base suggestive of either pulmonary contusion or a developing infiltrate.
