A portable frontal semi-erect chest radiograph demonstrates mild cardiomegaly, which may be due in part to technique. There is diffuse increased opacity bilaterally, compatible with mild pulmonary edema. Additionally, more focal opacity projecting over the bilateral lower lungs is concerning for pneumonia. A VP shunt overlies the right hemi thorax and visualize right upper abdomen. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is otherwise unremarkable.
