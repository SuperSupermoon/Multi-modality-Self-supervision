1. A right subclavian central line remains in position with its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Dual-lead left-sided pacer with its leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. Markedly low lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with indistinct vasculature on the left raising a concern for asymmetric pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity at the right base may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. A mid to distal left clavicular fracture is again seen. No pneumothorax.
