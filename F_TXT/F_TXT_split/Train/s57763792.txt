AP chest compared to ___: Severe pulmonary edema has not improved, accompanied by at least small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate to severe cardiomegaly. Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads follow their expected courses. There is no pneumothorax. Given the severity of pulmonary edema, concurrent pneumonia would not be appreciated, but need not be invoked to explain the radiographic findings.
