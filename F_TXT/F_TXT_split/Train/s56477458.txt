AP chest compared to ___: Transient improvement in widespread pulmonary opacification on ___ continues to reverse, with a substantial increase in widespread pulmonary consolidation, moderate bilateral pleural effusions and mediastinal vascular engorgement. Some of this interval change could be due to simple pulmonary edema, but how much is contributed by pneumonia or non-cardiogenic edema is radiographically indeterminate. Cardiomegaly is only mild. ET tube and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements. Right central venous line ends low in the SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
