Lung volumes are chronically very low, with particular elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, conforming to the provided history of diaphragm paralysis reflected in moderately severe atelectasis at both lung bases. The upper lobes vessels are engorged, but I do not believe there is pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Heart size is normal. Pleural effusions are small if any.
