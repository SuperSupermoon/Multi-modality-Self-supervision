AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination obtained five hours earlier during the same day. An NG tube has now been placed, seen to pass well below the diaphragm and pointing within the stomach towards the pylorus. No significant interval changes in the chest findings.
