AP chest compared to ___, ___ and ___, most recently 10:38 a.m.: Pulmonary vascular congestion and ___ moderate increase in heart size are new, but as yet there is little if any pulmonary edema. The large sail-shaped opacity at the base of the right hemithorax medially is presumably remnants of the diaphragmatic hernia, but there is also likely atelectasis and pleural effusions on both sides of the chest, which bear watching, particularly as a region where pneumonia can hide. Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall is new. There is no pneumothorax.
