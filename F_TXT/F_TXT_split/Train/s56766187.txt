Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Single lead left-sided AICD is again seen with lead extending to the expected position of the right ventricle. Patient is status post median sternotomy. There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles, left greater than right, consistent with bilateral pleural effusions. Prominence of the perihilar vasculature is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion. Left retrocardiac opacity may relate to the combination of atelectasis and effusion, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. Marked degenerative changes are seen at the right humerus which may be post-traumatic, although underlying avascular necrosis cannot be excluded. There is diffuse osteopenia.
