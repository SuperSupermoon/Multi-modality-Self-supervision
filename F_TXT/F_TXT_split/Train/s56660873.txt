As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities at both lung bases have markedly improved. The lung bases are better ventilated and areas of opacities, likely of atelectatic origin, persist only at the retrocardiac lung areas and left lung bases as well as at the medial aspects of the right lung. The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The size of the cardiac silhouette is borderline and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema. The overall hypertransparency at the level of the right upper quadrant is consistent with free abdominal air (the referring note mentions perforated diverticulitis and status post multiple washouts). At the time of dictation and observation, 7:38 a.m., on ___, the referring physician, ___. ___ was paged for notification.
