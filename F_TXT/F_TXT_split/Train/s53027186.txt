Left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with a persistent very small left apical pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Widespread pulmonary nodules appear similar to the prior radiograph, in keeping with known metastatic disease. Worsening superimposed opacities at the lung bases could be due to atelectasis, aspiration or infectious consolidation. Bilateral pleural effusions appear unchanged.
