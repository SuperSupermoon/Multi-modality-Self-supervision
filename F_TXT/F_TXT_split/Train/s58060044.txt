Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. At least two of the sternal wires are fractured. Medial left side vascular stent is again seen. There has been interval removal of a right-sided PICC. Mild bibasilar atelectasis persists but appears somewhat improved. Again seen is an opacity projecting over the left upper hemithorax, to the left of the aortic knob, likely representing summation of shadows, including the anterior aspect of the left first rib. No large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The aorta is calcified.
