The lungs are hyperinflated. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Patchy left base opacity could be due to atelectasis but consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is no pulmonary edema. Chain sutures are noted projecting over the left upper hemi thorax.
