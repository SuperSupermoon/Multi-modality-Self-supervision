In the interval since the prior study, there is now near-complete opacification of the right hemi thorax possibly due to a combination of pleural fluid and lung opacification. While part of the parenchymal abnormalities may be contusions, which can often develop hours post initial insult, the more worrisome possibilities include hemothorax especially given the patient's hematocrit has decreased. A chest CT could be reasonable at this juncture for further evaluation.
