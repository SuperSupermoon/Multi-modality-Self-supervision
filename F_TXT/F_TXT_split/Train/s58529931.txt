Since the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, the patient has apparently been extubated. Apparent narrowing of the proximal trachea could potentially represent edema in the post intubation state but is suboptimally evaluated due to patient rotation and portable radiographic technique. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Previously reported bibasilar opacities have improved on the left and worsened on the right. The latter could reflect atelectasis or a developing infectious pneumonia. Small pleural effusions persist, left greater than right.
