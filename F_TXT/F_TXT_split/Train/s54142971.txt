There is very slight rotated positioning. Multiple lines and tubes are present, nominal in position. The right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip may lie in the RV or at the origin of the pulmonary outflow tract. No pneumothorax detected. Again seen is cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires and prosthetic valve. The aortic valve is indistinct, but not clearly changed compared with the most recent prior film. Equivocal slight convexity is seen in the region of the aortopulmonary window, in the setting of air bronchograms and consolidation around the lobar and segmental airways. Mild vascular plethora is again noted, grossly unchanged. Also again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with obscuration left hemidiaphragm. This has probably increased slightly compare with the prior film. The possibility of a small left effusion cannot be excluded. Minimal atelectasis at the right base is slightly increased. No gross effusion identified.
