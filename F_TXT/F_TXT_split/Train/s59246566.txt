Portable supine frontal view of the chest. The lung volumes are very low. There is diffuse airspace opacity in the right lung. Bilateral interstitial prominence likely represents mild pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The heart size is accentuated due to low lung volumes, but is probably normal. The mediastinal contours are normal.
