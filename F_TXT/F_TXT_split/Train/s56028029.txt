Portable AP radiograph is obtained through the mid chest and upper abdomen. In comparison to the study of one hour prior the tip of the NG tube is minimally advanced, but still remains at the level of the diaphragm with the side hole in the lower esophagus. Surgical clips are noted in the upper abdomen. No significant changes compared to the prior study.
