Right pigtail pleural catheter is in unchanged position. Lung volume is lower than before, possibly due to less suboptimal inspiration during image acquisition. There is persistent right lung opacity and moderate loculated pleural effusion. Small left lung base opacity and pleural effusion is noted. Enlarged cardiac silhouette is similar to before.
