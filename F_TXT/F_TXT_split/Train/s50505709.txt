Single portable AP chest radiograph was provided. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and interstitial markings, likely representing mild pulmonary edema. There are bilateral pleural effusions, small on the right and moderate on the left. Right basilar opacities may again be due to pulmonary edema; however, infection is also possible. The heart remains enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. The bones are intact.
