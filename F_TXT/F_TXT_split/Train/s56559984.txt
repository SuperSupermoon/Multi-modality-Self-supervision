As compared to the previous radiograph, the central venous access line on the right has been pulled back. The tip of the line now projects over the low SVC and is approximately 4-5 cm more proximal than on the previous examination. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other complications. The lung volumes have slightly decreased. The known bilateral apical opacities, combines to areas of apical thickening are constant in appearance. No pleural effusions.
