Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities throughout both lung fields. There is more confluent opacity within the right lung which appears to have worsened since the previous study. Fluid overload is felt less likely given the lack of widening of the vascular pedicle. There is also some subsegmental atelectasis at the lung bases. There are no pneumothoraces. Median sternotomy wires are seen and there is slight cardiomegaly, stable.
