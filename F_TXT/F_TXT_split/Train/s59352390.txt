Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and calcified, similar compared to the previous exam. There is no pulmonary edema, and the hilar contours are within normal limits. Patchy opacities are noted in both lung bases, which could reflect areas of atelectasis, though infection is not completely excluded. Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present. No pneumothorax is seen. Degenerative changes of the left shoulder from noted.
