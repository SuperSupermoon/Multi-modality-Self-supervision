AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study dated ___. The right lung base, which on the next previous examination demonstrated increased evidence of pleural effusion, has cleared up partially, indicating successful removal of pleural effusion. Examination of the right apical area with magnification device does not disclose any evidence of a small pneumothorax in this area. Previously described pulmonary changes are grossly unaltered.
