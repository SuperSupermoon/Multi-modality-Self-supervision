A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, an enteric tube terminating at the GE junction, with the side port in the mid esophagus, and a left subclavian line terminating at the cavoatrial junction. A right internal jugular line is no longer present. No pneumothorax is appreciated. There is atelectasis of the right middle lobe. Retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis, is similar to slightly increased. Mild pulmonary edema is improved. There is a trace left pleural effusion. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
