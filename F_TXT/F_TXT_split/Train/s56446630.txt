Exam is limited by marked leftward patient rotation. Since a recent radiograph from earlier the same date, a right internal jugular catheter is been placed, with tip directed laterally into the right subclavian vein and potentially terminating at the junction of the subclavian and axillary veins. Note is also made of a questionable small right basilar pneumothorax, difficult to assess in the setting of overlapping artifact in this region as well as patient rotation. Otherwise no relevant change since recent study.
