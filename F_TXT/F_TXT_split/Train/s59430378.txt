Compared with the prior study and allowing for apparent blurring due to motion on today's study, there is somewhat more confluent opacity through much of the right lung, suggesting the presence of an alveolar component. Possible small confluent areas scattered in the left lung. No effusion is identified. Bilateral background interstitial changes are similar to the prior film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with prominence of the ascending and descending aorta. No pneumothorax is detected. Cerclage wire can clips seen over the lower neck.
