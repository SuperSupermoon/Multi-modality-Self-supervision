Since the prior radiograph, the right chest tube has been removed. There is no residual pneumothorax. A right PICC ends in the mid right subclavian vein. A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the upper SVC. It appears kinked at the most proximal end, which may be external to the patient. A left subclavian central line ends in the low SVC. A left chest tube is present. Sternal wires are intact. The moderate right pleural effusion has increased in size. A small left pleural effusion is stable. Multiple bilateral opacities and cavitary nodules reflect the patient's known septic emboli. Possible mild edema may be present, but is difficult to determine with the multifocal opacifications. It is unchanged from the prior exam. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with the expected postoperative appearance.
