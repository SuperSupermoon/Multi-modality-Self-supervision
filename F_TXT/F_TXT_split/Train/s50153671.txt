The tracheostomy tube appears to project over the midline trachea. Again seen is extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the pectoralis muscles and cervical regions bilaterally. Diffuse unchanged reticulonodular interstitial process with a more focal airspace confluent opacity at the right apex appears slightly improved compared to the prior exam. There is stable pneumoperitoneum. The previously noted pneumothorax is not well delineated on this exam. There are stable bilateral small pleural effusions.
