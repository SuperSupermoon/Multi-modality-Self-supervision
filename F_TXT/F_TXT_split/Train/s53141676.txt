Pneumonia in the right lung is still severe although there has been some re-expansion of previously atelectatic right lower lobe. Combination points to large scale aspiration. On the left there is either new basal vascular congestion or developing peribronchial opacification in the lower lung which needs to be monitored for the possibility of developing pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion. ET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view an a right jugular line ends low in the SVC
