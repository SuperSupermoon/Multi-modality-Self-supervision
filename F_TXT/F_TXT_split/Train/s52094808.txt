Single portable view of the chest. No prior. Relatively low inspiratory effort is seen. Somewhat linear opacity is seen in the right mid lung, most suggestive of atelectasis. There is no large confluent consolidation and no large effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
