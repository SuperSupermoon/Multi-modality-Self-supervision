In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. The tip of the nasogastric tube is only within the distal esophagus as on the prior study. Continued increased opacification at the right base, suggesting pleural fluid and substantial volume loss in the right lower lung. Less prominent atelectatic changes are seen at the left base. The area of increased opacification in the left mid zone and base again could reflect merely atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
