Cardiac size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy better seen in prior CT should be followed after the acute illness in 3 months with CT. Right IJ catheter tip is in the cavoatrial junction. NG tube tip is not visualized but the side port appears to be in the lower esophagus and should be advanced for more standard position. Bibasilar atelectasis larger on the left side are grossly unchanged. More irregular ill-defined opacities in the left mid lung are worrisome for aspiration. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion
