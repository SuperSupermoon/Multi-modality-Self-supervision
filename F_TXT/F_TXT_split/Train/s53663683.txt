Lung volumes are low. The left apex is partially obscured by an overlying drape and monitor lead. There is no definite evidence of a pneumothorax. Bibasilar and retrocardiac pulmonary opacities and pleural fluid persist. The heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged. Tubes consistent with a mediastinal drain, left chest tube and a right subclavian catheter remain in place.
