No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. No evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion. No definite acute focal pneumonia, though there is a vague area of asymmetric opacification on the right just above the hemidiaphragm that could represent consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting. Central catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
