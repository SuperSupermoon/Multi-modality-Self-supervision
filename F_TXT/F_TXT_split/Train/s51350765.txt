As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a massive improvement, with near-complete resolution of the pre-existing diffuse interstitial opacities. The only lung area with minimal remnant opacities is the right lung apex. No pleural effusions. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No hilar or mediastinal abnormalities.
