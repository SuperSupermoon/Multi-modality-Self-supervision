A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates pacer wires overlying the patient's chest. There is a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Lungs are clear, but most likely hyperinflated. Also there is paucity of the vasculature in the upper lungs most likely consistent with emphysema. No focal consolidation, edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm vs. pleural abnormality vs, diaphragmatic hernia. Correlation with lateral chest radiograph or chest CT is necessary. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
