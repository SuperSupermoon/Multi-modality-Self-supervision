Right pigtail pleural catheter is been removed and replaced by a standard right chest tube. Multiloculated right pleural effusion is again demonstrated with possible small pneumothorax component and persistent adjacent atelectasis and or consolidation in the right mid and lower lung. Mediastinal widening is likely stable allowing for differences in technique between the exams. Small left pleural effusion is minimally increased.
