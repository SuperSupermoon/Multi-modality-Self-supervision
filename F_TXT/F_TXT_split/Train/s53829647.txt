1. New consolidation involving a substantial portion of the right lung is consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, and warrants followup radiographs after treatment to ensure resolution. . 2. Internal cystic lucencies within the consolidation may reflect areas of spared lung, but early cavitation from necrotizing pneumonia is an additional consideration. Consider initial further evaluation with dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs.
