A left subclavian PICC line is present, with tip over cavoatrial junction, similar to prior. The heart is not enlarged. Lungs are hyperinflated, raising question of background COPD. There is upper zone redistribution. There is slight patchy opacity of both lung bases medially. There is also slight right-greater-than-left patchy opacity in the suprahilar regions bilaterally. No frank consolidation or gross effusion. Small rounded opacities and lateral portion both lung bases may represent nipple shadows and would be compatible with the appearance on the ___ CTA. .
