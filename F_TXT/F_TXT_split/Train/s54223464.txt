Compared with ___ at 19:33 p.m., the right apical pneumothorax is now not definitely identified. The possibility of a small residual pneumothorax cannot be excluded. The right-sided chest tube is again noted, slightly different in configuration, but still with tip overlying the right upper lung. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged, in the setting of continuing low lung volumes. Again seen are increased interstitial markings throughout both lungs, with some more confluent opacity in the right mid zone and left lung base, also similar to prior.
