AP chest compared to ___: Right lung is essentially clear. Left lower lobe is partially obscured by the heart and descending thoracic aorta but has not changed since ___ and there are no findings in the left lung to suggest pneumonia. Pleural effusion is minimal if any. Mild cardiomegaly and the severely enlarged and non-physiologically contoured thoracic aorta are unchanged since at least ___ when a CTA showed a large thoracic aortic aneurysm but no dissection. It is entirely conceivable that dissection could occur with no changes on the conventional chest radiograph but there are no findings to suggest that that has recurred.
