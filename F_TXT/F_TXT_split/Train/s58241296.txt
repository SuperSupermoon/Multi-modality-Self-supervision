The left subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position with its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. There is a persistent left pleural effusion with associated airspace process most likely representing partial lower lobar collapse, although pneumonia in this area cannot be excluded. The remaining visualized lungs are clear. There is some cephalization of the vasculature consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension, but no overt pulmonary edema is evident. No pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. A patchy opacity at the right medial lung base is again noted and likely reflects atelectasis.
