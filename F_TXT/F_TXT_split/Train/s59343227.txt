As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have substantially decreased. There is no focal parenchymal opacity, but both lung bases appear denser than normal, which could be indicative of pneumonia. Moreover, there is comparative widening of the mediastinum, with disappearance of the right paratracheal stripe. No pleural effusions are seen. The size of the cardiac silhouette is borderline. No evidence of pneumothorax. If a repeat radiograph, optimally performed in standing position, continues to show these changes, CT should be considered to evaluate for potential parenchymal and mediastinal lesions.
