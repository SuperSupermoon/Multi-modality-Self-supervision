Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in standard position. Central venous catheter is been removed with no visible pneumothorax. Stable cardiomediastinal contours. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by moderate edema. Asymmetrical bibasilar airspace opacities worse on the right than the left could reflect asymmetrical edema, although superimposed secondary process in the right lung such as aspiration should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Small pleural effusions are present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
