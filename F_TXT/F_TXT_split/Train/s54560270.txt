AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. Status post sternotomy, as before. The metallic components of an apparent porcine aortic valve prosthesis can be identified in place. The heart size has not increased further beyond what has been identified on several postoperative chest examinations. There is now markedly increased pleural density on the right base obliterating the right-sided diaphragm and fluid accumulating along the lateral chest wall on the right side. This finding is new and has changed significantly from the last previous examination where some small lingering postoperative pleural effusions could be identified. A small caliber tube is overlying the left lower hemithorax and terminates within the heart shadow. It is assumed that it represents the pericardial drainage tube from the reported recent pericardiocentesis. Course of the rapidly developing right-sided pleural effusion is unclear. The accessible pulmonary vasculature does not show significant CHF pattern and no pneumothorax is seen in the apical area. Referring physician, ___. ___, was paged. Acute pleural effusion, probably hamartoma related to pericardial drainage procedure was transmitted at 2:10 p.m.
