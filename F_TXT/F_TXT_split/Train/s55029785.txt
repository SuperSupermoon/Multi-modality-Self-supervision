Comparison is made with prior study ___. New shifting of the cardiomediastinum towards the left and increasing opacities in the left lung, more so in the left lower lobe, are consistent with collapse in the left lower lobe. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated. Opacities in the right lower lobe are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral effusions are grossly unchanged. There is mild vascular congestion. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
