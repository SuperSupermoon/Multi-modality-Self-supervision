Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, with a small left pleural effusion slightly increased from the prior study. Patchy opacities in the lung bases are also increased, and may reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected.
