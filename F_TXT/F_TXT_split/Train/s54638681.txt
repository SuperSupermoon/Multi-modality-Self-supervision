Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Streaky bibasilar opacities are more pronounced in the left lung base, and likely reflect areas of atelectasis. A small left pleural effusion is likely present. No pneumothorax is detected. No acute osseous abnormalities seen. No subdiaphragmatic free air is present.
