A left-sided pacer remains in place. A right subclavian PICC line has its tip at the cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium. There has been interval removal of the right subclavian Swan-Ganz catheter. There are layering bilateral effusions with patchy airspace opacity, left greater than right, which most likely reflects compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is mild but improved interstitial edema. No pneumothorax. Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.
