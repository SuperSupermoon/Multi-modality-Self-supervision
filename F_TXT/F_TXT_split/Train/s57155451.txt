The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The lungs are well expanded and clear, without consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No displaced rib fractures are seen. Limited view of the thoracic spine is unremarkable. If there is high concern for T-spine injury dedicated T-pine radiographs can be obtained.
