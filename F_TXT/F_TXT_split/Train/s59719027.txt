In comparison to previous study of 1 day earlier, endotracheal tube has been repositioned with tip now terminating 9 cm above the carina. This could be advanced several cm for standard positioning. Exam is otherwise remarkable for improving asymmetrically distributed bilateral alveolar opacities. Such rapid improvement favors at least a component of pulmonary edema with or without coexisting pneumonia. No other relevant change.
