The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Lung volumes are low. The course of a right-sided PICC line is difficult to follow within the mediastinum due to incomplete penetration of soft tissue structures. It passes at least into the upper superior vena cava, its tip not visualized on this study. There is probably a small pleural effusion on the left and in any case hazy opacification which could be seen with either atelectasis although potentially pneumonia. There is similar mild perhilar vascular engorgement. However, there has been no significant change.
