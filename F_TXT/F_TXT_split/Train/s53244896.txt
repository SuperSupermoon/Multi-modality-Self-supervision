There is bibasilar atelectasis. Basilar opacities may relate to atelectasis although, underlying pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting vertically at the medial left lung base. No large pleural effusion is seen although trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. There may be minimal interstitial edema. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Aortic calcifications are seen. There is no pneumothorax.
