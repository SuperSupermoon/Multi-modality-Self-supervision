AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding study obtained six hours earlier during the same day. During the interval, the position of the ETT has been adjusted. Previously, the distance between the ET tip and the carina measured 6.5 cm and this distance has been reduced to 5.2 cm. Central airways remain unchanged and apparently are free. The previously described bilateral mostly centrally located parenchymal infiltrates persist. No significant interval change can be identified. No pneumothorax has developed in the apical area. Previously described right internal jugular approach central venous line remains in unchanged position. Unchanged appearance of previously described multiple healed rib fractures and marked left-sided convex scoliosis in lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine as before. Review with the next preceding chest examination of ___, obtained at the emergency room, the development of the bilateral mostly central pulmonary parenchymal densities occurred very rapidly as the heart size has not changed significantly, consider the possibility of rather massive aspiration. During the interval, ___.
