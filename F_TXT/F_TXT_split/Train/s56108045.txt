An endotracheal tube has been placed that terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina. A orogastric tube passes into the stomach, its distal course not imaged. Lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with effacement of the right costophrenic sulcus and mild pleural thickening, apparently chronic in nature. Likewise, blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus appears unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
