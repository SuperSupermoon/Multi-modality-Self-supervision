AP chest compared to ___: Vascular congestion in the upper lobes has improved, bibasilar consolidation, left greater than right, is unchanged, probably combination of atelectasis and residual dependent edema with overlying small bilateral pleural effusion. Pneumonia, if present, is probably in the left lower lobe. Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette could be due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.
