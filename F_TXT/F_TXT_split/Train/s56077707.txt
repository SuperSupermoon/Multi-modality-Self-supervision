The lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear likely unchanged, allowing for differences in technique. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava, as before. Minimal basilar opacities suggest minor atelectasis. Pulmonary vascularity is slightly prominent suggesting pulmonary vascular hypertension or slight fluid overload.
