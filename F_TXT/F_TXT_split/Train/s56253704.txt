Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular venous access catheter, have been removed. In addition, there has been removal of the previously present chest tubes and nasogastric tube. A left-sided PICC terminates with tip in the cavoatrial junction, unchanged. There is increased bibasilar atelectasis and consolidation with particular left retrocardiac opacity. Diffuse increased opacity throughout the remainder of the lung field is likely related to low lung volumes. No evidence of pneumothorax.
