Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. A right-sided PICC has migrated in proximal position as compared to the prior study and appears to terminate in the right subclavian vein. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. There is a moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, though underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Otherwise, cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
