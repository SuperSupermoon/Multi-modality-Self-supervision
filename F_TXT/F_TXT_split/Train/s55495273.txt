Compared to the prior study, the right IJ central line is been removed. No pneumothorax is detected. Extrinsic materials overlie the right the soft tissues of the right upper chest. There is background hyperinflation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged allowing for differences in positioning. The azygos vein appears less engorged. There has been considerable interval improvement in the left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, though residual opacity and a possible small left effusion remain present. The right pleural effusion is also probably improved, with some residual atelectasis at the right base. There is upper zone redistribution and minimal vascular plethora, without overt CHF. Incidental note made of calcified granuloma at the right base medially. Note is made of subtle slight difference in the degree of density of the hemithoraces, more lucent on the left, new, but of uncertain significance. This may be related to some subtle layering pleural fluid on the right, particularly if the patient's position was recently changed. Skin ___ seen in the upper abdomen. Tubing overlies the right upper quadrant.
