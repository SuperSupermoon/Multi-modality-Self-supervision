Since ___ at 04:22 following bronchoscopy, only the apical posterior segment of the otherwise collapsed left lung has re-expanded.

Bilateral basal pleural drains in place. No pneumothorax. Left heart border is obscured by the abnormal left lung and any left pleural effusion, there is no indication than the mild cardiomegaly has worsened. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.
