Two left-sided chest tubes remain in place, with similar appearance of moderate sized partially loculated left pleural effusion and/or pleural thickening. Post-radiation changes in the paramediastinal and parahilar regions appear similar with accompanying volume loss. A more focal area of opacity in the left retrocardiac region. This may be due to atelectasis or infectious pneumonia. There remains diffuse interstitial and asymmetrical perihilar opacities (left greater than right), suggestive of a pulmonary edema.
