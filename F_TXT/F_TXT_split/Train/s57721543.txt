Single portable view of the chest. There is chronic opacity at the left costophrenic angle known to at least be in part due to rounded atelectasis with possible superimposed effusion, and has not significantly changed. The remainder of the lungs are grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Old healed mid left clavicular fracture is again seen.
