As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of low lung volumes. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette and relatively extensive bilateral areas of atelectasis, potentially associated to a small pleural effusion on the right. No new parenchymal opacities, in particular no opacity suggesting pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
