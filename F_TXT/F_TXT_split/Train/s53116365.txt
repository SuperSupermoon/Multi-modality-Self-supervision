As compared to the previous radiograph from several hours earlier, postoperative widening of the mediastinum is similar in appearance as well as postoperative volume loss related to recent right upper lobe resection. Low lung volumes result in crowding of pulmonary vasculature. Small right pleural effusion is present but there is no visible pneumothorax. Subcutaneous emphysema is present in the right chest wall near the insertion site of a right chest tube.
