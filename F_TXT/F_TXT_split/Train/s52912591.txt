Cardiomediastinal contours are normal in appearance. Lungs are clear except for a tiny calcified granuloma in the periphery of the right lower lobe. No rib fractures are identified, but portable chest radiographs are relatively insensitive for detecting rib fractures, especially those involving the anterior ribs. There is no visible pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
