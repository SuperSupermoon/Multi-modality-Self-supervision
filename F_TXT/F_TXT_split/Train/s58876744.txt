Compared to the prior study, a right pigtail catheter has been placed in the right lower thorax and there is markedly decreased right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. There is likely still small left pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted, but otherwise the lungs appear clear. Cardiomegaly persists. Left jugular central venous catheter has its tip within the lower SVC. Right jugular catheter with temporary pacer with electrode within the right ventricle is in expected and unaltered position.
