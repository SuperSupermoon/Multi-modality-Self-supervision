The lung volumes are relatively low. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. At the right lung base, a triangular area of atelectatic lung tissue is seen. No lung nodules or masses. Given the absence of prior films, short term radiographic followup is recommended to further observe the opacity at the right lung base.
