AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar chest examination obtained two and a half hours earlier during the same day. During the short examination interval, a new left-sided chest tube has been placed in addition to the existing previously described one. The new line was inserted two rib spaces lower in the lateral chest wall and advanced through the medial mediastinal pleural space, reaching the apical area. This line apparently has been very effective in removing the pneumothorax which now cannot be identified with certainty any more on this portable chest examination. Also, the diaphragmatic contour on the left side is now partially visible again and when comparison is made with the previous examination, the at that time existing degree of mediastinal shift towards the right suggesting tension pneumothorax on the left, has restored to normal position. The patient remains intubated with the ETT terminating in the trachea and the position of the left subclavian central venous line is unaltered.
