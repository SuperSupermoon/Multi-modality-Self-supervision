Heart is mildly enlarged and associated with vascular engorgement and overall worsening of bilateral juxtahilar pulmonary opacities, particularly on the left. This is likely due to pulmonary edema, but coexisting secondary process such as infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting, particularly given the somewhat nodular quality of opacities in the right lung.
