Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained on ___. The current study demonstrates extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities, substantially progressed since the prior study, most likely representing severe alveolar pulmonary edema. Pulmonary hemorrhage or wide spreading infection although is a possibility, but substantially less likely. The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The right internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. The left internal jugular line tip is at the junction of brachiocephalic vein and SVC. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen. Pleural effusion is most likely present, although cannot be estimated on this supine radiograph. Alternatively, in the appropriate clinical setting, ARDS might have a similar radiographic appearance, correlation with clinical symptoms is required.
