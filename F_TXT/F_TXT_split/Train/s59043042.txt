Lordotic positioning. There is relative hyperlucency of the upper and mid zones on both sides, suggesting severe emphysema. There is slight upper zone redistribution. There are patchy opacities at both lung bases. This may reflect crowding of vessels at the lung bases due to emphysematous changes. However, it is more pronounced, particularly on the left, compared with ___ and ___. Thus, the possibility of superimposed infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded. Asymmetric distribution of CHF is considered less likely. Blunting of the costophrenic angles is grossly unchanged. Vertical linear lucency in the left paratracheal region adjacent to the aortic knob is similar to ___ and therefore unlikely to represent pneumomediastinum. Otherwise, no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
