AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained. Port-A-Cath is seen projecting over the right axilla with catheter extending into the right IJ and tip terminating in the expected location of the superior vena cava. A consolidation is again noted in the right lower lobe which is compatible with the patient's known primary malignancy. Lung volumes are low which limit the evaluation. The heart is unchanged in size, appearing top normal. There is no overt CHF. A small right effusion is difficult to exclude. Bony structures appear intact.
