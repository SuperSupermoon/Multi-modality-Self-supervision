AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The tracheostomy is in place with the tip of the tracheostomy being at the level of 4.6 cm above the carina. The left PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged, but there is interval increase in right pleural effusion, although potentially it might reflect slightly different position of the patient in different layering. There is also left pleural effusion, smaller. Interstitial pulmonary edema is redemonstrated. Consolidation might be obscured by pleural effusions.
