AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The previously present, most likely endotracheal stent has been removed. The right chest tubes are in place. The mediastinum appears to be wider than on the prior study, which might be related to post-procedure appearance, but continued surveillance is recommended to exclude the possibility of mediastinal hemorrhage. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen. Elevated right hemidiaphragm is redemonstrated, but there is potentially worsening of the right lower lung atelectasis.
