The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. There is some opacification of the medial right lower lung which does not silhouette the right cardiac border or hemidiaphragm, probably due to crowding of lung markings or minor atelectasis. Etiologies such as pneumonia and aspiration are not excluded based on imaging, however, and correlation with clinical circumstances is suggested.
