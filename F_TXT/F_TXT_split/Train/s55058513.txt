As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position. The lung volumes have slightly decreased. Moderate cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema persists. Small areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases have mildly increased. Blunting of the right costophrenic sinus is mimicking a small right pleural effusion but is likely caused by a slight patient rotation. No evidence of pneumonia.
