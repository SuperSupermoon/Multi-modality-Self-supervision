ET tube and NG tube are in similar position compared to prior. Low lung volumes are minimally improved, again causing some accentuation of the cardiac silhouette and causing bronchovascular crowding. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. Pleural effusions are small if any. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Imaged osseous structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
