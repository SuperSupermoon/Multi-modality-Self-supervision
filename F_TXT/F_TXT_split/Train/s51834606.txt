One of two left-sided chest tubes has been removed. Small left apical pneumothorax is not appreciably changed, and moderate left pleural effusion also appears similar. The remaining recently described lung and pleural abnormalities also appears similar compared to the recent study. Feeding tube and central venous catheter have been removed, with no evidence of a right-sided pneumothorax.
