The exam is underpenetrated, and the distal aspect of the tube is not well assessed. However, the endotracheal tube appears to terminate approximately 2 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube may be present, although it is not seen below the mid thorax. Suggest repeat for better assessment. There are low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a small pleural effusion. There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature which is likely accentuated by low lung volumes and AP portable technique; however, component of vascular congestion may be present.
