The patient has been intubated, and an orogastric tube has been removed. A right IJ line extending to the low SVC, bilateral chest tubes, and a mediastinal drain are in unchanged position. There is increased veiled opacity over the lung bases bilaterally, implying new effusions, moderate in size. There is no pneumothorax. Mild vascular congestion is unchanged. There is no new focal opacity to suggest pneumonia. Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
