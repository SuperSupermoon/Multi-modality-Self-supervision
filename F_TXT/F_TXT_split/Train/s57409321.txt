A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends 4.2 cm above the carina. The right Port-A-Cath and left internal jugular catheter end in the mid SVC. An orogastric tube follows the expected course, although the tip is not visualized. Soft tissue density adjacent to the aortic knob is again noted, unchanged in appearance from the prior study. This may represent pneumonia, but remains concerning for dissection given the unchanged left pleural effusion. A small right pleural effusion and cardiomegaly are unchanged.
