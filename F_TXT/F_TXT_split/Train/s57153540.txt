As compared to the previous radiograph, the PICC line has been minimally pulled back. The tip of the line currently projects over the upper-to-mid SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Minimal basal areas of atelectasis persist, the size of the cardiac silhouette is normal.
