Evaluation is somewhat limited due to kyphotic positioning and patient rotation. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.7 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube tip is seen below the diaphragm, though the side port appears to be above the gastroesophageal junction, and this tube should be advanced. The cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged. There are low lung volumes, which accentuates the width of the mediastinum. Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is noted. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
