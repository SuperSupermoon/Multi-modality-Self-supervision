Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is new compared to the previous exam. The aorta is mildly tortuous. Hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Degenerative changes are noted involving the left glenohumeral joint.
