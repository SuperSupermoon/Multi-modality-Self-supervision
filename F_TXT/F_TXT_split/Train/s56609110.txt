Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. Patient is known to have extensive underlying emphysema. Opacity in the left lung base is most likely reflective of a pleural effusion and possibly subjacent atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There is also a small right pleural effusion. Overall findings appear slightly progressed at the left lung base compared with prior study. The heart remains mildly enlarged. No pneumothorax is seen. Bony structures are intact. Left chest wall pacer device is again seen with lead tips extending into the right atrium and right ventricle.
