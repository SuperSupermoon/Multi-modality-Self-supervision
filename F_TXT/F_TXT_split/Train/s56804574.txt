Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Underlying trauma board and other external artifact partially obscures the view. Given this, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No displaced fracture is identified.
