In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. Right Port-A-Cath tip again extends to the lower SVC. The patient has taken a better inspiration. Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits. However, there is now diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, worse on the right. Some of this could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, combined with layering pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis especially on the right. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be seriously considered, as would be the development of ARDS. .
