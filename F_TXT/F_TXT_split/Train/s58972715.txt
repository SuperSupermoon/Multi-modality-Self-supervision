Single portable view of the chest compared to previous exam from earlier same day at 6:32 p.m. There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube seen projecting over left lung base, side port within the thoracic cavity. Overlying subcutaneous gas is identified. Pneumothorax seen at the lower chest on prior has resolved. There is still subtle lucency adjacent to the AP window suggesting persistent pneumothorax, although no discrete pleural line is identified. Right lung remains clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as are the osseous structures.
