Again seen is catheter at the left lung base. There is some hairpin-like overlap at the skin entry site and clinical correlation to assess for any kinking in this location is requested. However, this could also be an artifact of projection image. Again seen is a small left apical pneumothorax, similar to the film on ___ at 18:09 p.m. A small left effusion is also again noted, without gross change. Otherwise,dense diffuse alveolar opacities in both lungs and diffuse increased opacity in the visualized bones appear similar to prior film.
