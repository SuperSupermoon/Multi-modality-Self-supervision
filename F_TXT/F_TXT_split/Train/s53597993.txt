In comparison with the study of ___, there may be a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax with the the chest tube in place. Subcutaneous gas is again seen near the insertion of the tube site. The left hemidiaphragm is better seen, suggesting some improvement in lower lobe atelectasis and pleural fluid. Otherwise little change.
