Compared with the prior study, the appearance is grossly unchanged. Again seen is tracheostomy tube and right subclavian and left IJ central lines, similar in appearance. No pneumothorax is detected, allowing for obscuration of the lung apex by the overlying mass. Again seen are diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities throughout both lungs, with increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of both hemidiaphragms. Probable right and suspected left pleural effusions. The appearance is compatible with pulmonary edema and bi basilar effusions, but the possibility of an associated pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded.
