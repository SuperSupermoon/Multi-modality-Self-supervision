As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing volume loss in the middle lobe has improved. However, the pre-existing right basal opacity, predominantly in peribronchial location and displaying multiple air bronchograms, unchanged. Minimal improvement of a pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis, a pre-existing plate-like atelectasis at the left lung base has resolved. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, no indication for pleural effusions. Signs of mild fluid overload might be present.
