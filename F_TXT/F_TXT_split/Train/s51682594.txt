Compared with the prior study, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is the elevated and lobulated,? eventrated, right hemidiaphragm. Of note, this appearance is much more pronounced than on ___. Mild lobulation/eventration of the left hemidiaphragm is again noted, also more pronounced than on ___. Left costophrenic sulcus is blunted. No gross effusion is identified. . Again noted is a nondilated splenic flexure deep to the lateral left hemidiaphragm. Suspect background hyperinflation/COPD. The heart is slightly enlarged, though the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, without evidence of CHF. There is subsegmental atelectasis/scarring at the right lung base. No focal infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia is identified. Again noted are calcified hilar lymph nodes suggestive of prior granulomatous disease. Incidental note is made of an old healed fracture the right posterior seventh rib.
