Single portable view of the chest. Low lung volumes are again seen. Vague opacity projects over the anterior right 2nd rib compatible with healing fracture seen on prior CT scan. The lungs are otherwise clear. Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged but likely accentuated due to low lung volumes. Left chest wall single lead pacing device is again noted.
