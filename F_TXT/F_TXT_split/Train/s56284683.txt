In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Continued low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. There is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. There is increasing opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm. Although much of this could represent volume loss and pleural effusion, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
