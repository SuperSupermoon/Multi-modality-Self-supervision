1. Interval removal of the left basilar chest tube with no evidence of pneumothorax. There is patchy retrocardiac opacity which likely represents atelectasis in the setting of a small layering left effusion. Lung volumes remain low and there continues to be some stable patchy atelectasis at the right base as well. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. No pulmonary edema. Crowding of vasculature related to relatively low volumes.
