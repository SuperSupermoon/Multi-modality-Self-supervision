As compared to the previous image, there is no relevant change. Status post CABG. The clips and sternotomy wires are in unchanged position. There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, consistent with a minimal right pleural effusion. Borderline diameter of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, but no evidence of pulmonary edema. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
