Cardiac size is top-normal accentuated by the low lung volumes. Worsening bibasilar opacities larger on the left side are worrisome for aspiration. Opacities in the upper lungs right greater than left have nodular appearance. These could be part of aspiration but septic embolism is not excluded given the nodular appearance, CT is advised. There is no pneumothorax. If any there is a small left effusion. NG tube tip is in the stomach, the side port is probably at the GE junction and should be advanced for more standard position
