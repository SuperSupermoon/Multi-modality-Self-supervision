1. A dual-lead right-sided pacer remains in place. The heart remains enlarged, unchanged in configuration favoring cardiomegaly. The mediastinal contours remain stably widened. There is calcification of the aortic knob consistent with atherosclerosis. There has been interval worsening with near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax as well as appearance of prominent vasculature in the left hilum. These findings suggest superimposed moderate pulmonary edema as well as possible interval increase in size of a right pleural effusion. Superimposed infectious process would be less likely given the acute changes over a two-day period. Clinical correlation is advised. Multiple subacute right-sided rib fractures are again seen. No large pneumothorax is seen on this semi-supine study.
