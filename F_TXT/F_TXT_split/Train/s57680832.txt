Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. New endotracheal tube terminates 1.4 cm above the carina. Enteric tube terminates below the diaphragm. Slight cephalization with pulmonary vascular engorgement is similar to prior. Bibasilar opacities persist and focal morphology favors infection over edema. No pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion. Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
