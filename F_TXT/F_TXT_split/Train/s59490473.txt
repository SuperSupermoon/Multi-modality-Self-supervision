In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes, which accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. There has been the development increased opacification at the left base with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural fluid. Little if any vascular congestion. Increased opacification at the right base medially most likely represents crowded vessels, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia could be sub considered in that area as well as in the retrocardiac region, especially in the absence of a lateral view. Changes in mediastinal contour most likely reflect the AP rather than PA projection. However, if there is any clinical sign of hemorrhage, CT would be indicated.
