AP chest compared to ___: Moderate right pleural effusion is still present, consolidation at the base of the left lung has improved, probably clearing atelectasis or pneumonia. Left pleural effusion is small and unchanged. Upper lungs show mild vascular engorgement, but I doubt that pulmonary edema is present, despite severe stable cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax.
