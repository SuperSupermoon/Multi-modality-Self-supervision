Cardiac size is top-normal. Right central catheter tip is in the right atrium. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Calcified granulomas in the left apex are again noted. Ill-defined left infrahilar opacity warrants further evaluation with CT. There are probably bibasilar atelectasis larger in the left base.
