AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The heart size is unchanged. No conclusive evidence of significant cardiac enlargement. The pulmonary vasculature is now quite normal, thus no evidence of pulmonary congestion or edema. The lateral pleural sinuses remain free. Tissue densities overshadow the apical area in marked lordotic position, but there is no evidence of pneumothorax. When comparison is made with the next preceding study, the earlier existing pulmonary vascular distended pattern has now regressed and is normal. No pneumothorax seen.
