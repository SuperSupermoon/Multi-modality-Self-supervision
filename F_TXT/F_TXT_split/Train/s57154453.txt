Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates blunting of the left costophrenic angle but with good visualization of the left hemi-diaphragm, which may represent pleural-pericardial adhesions. There is a small amount of streaky atelectasis in the right base. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
