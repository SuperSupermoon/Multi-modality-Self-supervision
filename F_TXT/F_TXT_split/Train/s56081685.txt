There has been interval removal of the right central venous catheter. Bibasilar pulmonary opacities, left greater than right, appear similar compared to prior and likely represent a combination of effusion and atelectasis, although left lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded. Mild pulmonary edema appears slightly worse in the interval. No pneumothorax is detected on this view. Heart size is enlarged. The aorta is calcified. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips likely reflect prior CABG.
