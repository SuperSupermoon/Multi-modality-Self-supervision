Single frontal view of the chest. Leads of a left chest wall generator terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle. The tip of a right sided dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium. The heart size is moderately enlarged. Bibasilar hazy opacities with indistinctness of the costophrenic angles are consistent with layering bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. Superimposed focal consolidation cannot be excluded. Mild pulmonary edema not excluded. No pneumothorax.
