An endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses through the esophagus and enters the stomach, although its distal course is not imaged. There is a left infrahilar consolidation obscuring the left hemidiaphragm with air bronchograms. Differential considerations include aspiration, atelectasis or infectious pneumonia. Perihilar opacification suggests coinciding mild vascular congestion or fluid overload. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
