AP chest compared to ___ at 5:04 p.m.: Feeding tube with the wire stylet withdrawn several centimeters from the tip ends in the upper stomach, after repositioning. I cannot tell whether there is still a loop of tubing in the hypopharynx. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. Heart is mildly enlarged and mediastinal veins are engorged. Pulmonary vasculature is also engorged and with lung volumes so low, it is difficult to say whether the patient is on the verge of pulmonary edema.
