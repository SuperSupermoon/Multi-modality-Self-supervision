The right IJ terminates in the low SVC. The ET tube terminates 2.7 cm from the carina and should be withdrawn 1-2 cm cm. The NG tube is in the stomach in the region of the pylorus. Bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, are worse on the left since yesterday and represent pleural effusions and atelectasis. A heterogenous opacity in the right lower lung suggests pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no pneumothorax. Also, there is no evidence of subdiaphragmatic air.
