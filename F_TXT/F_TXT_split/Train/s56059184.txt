AP chest compared to ___: Significant substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette due to worsening cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. New consolidative abnormality at the right lung apex could be a region of consolidation, due to pneumonia. It could also be substantial new pericardial effusion. Left lung is grossly clear. Severe widening of the mediastinal caliber at the level of the thoracic inlet could be due to vascular engorgement or lower paratracheal adenopathy. Marked increase in caliber of the cardiomediastinal silhouette could be a combination of progressive cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion. Chest CT scanning is strongly recommended to make these distinctions.
