As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new PICC line. The tip of the line projects over the lower SVC. The course of the line is unremarkable. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, unchanged radiograph with borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, left pectoral pacemaker, and absence of acute lung changes.
