AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi- recumbent position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar portable chest examination obtained seven hours earlier during the same day. The previously present NG tube has been removed. No pneumothorax can be identified. Noted, however, are markedly increased densities predominantly overlying the lung bases, but reaching higher now on this portable chest examination. One explanation could be that the previously present pleural effusions are layering higher up as the patient is in more supine position. Evidence of bilateral basal atelectasis as before. If quantification of pleural effusion is essential for future management, an additional lateral view could be of value.
