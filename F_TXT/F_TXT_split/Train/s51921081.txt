The endotracheal tube and feeding tube have been removed. There remains a tubular catheter projecting over the right upper abdomen and inferior heart. There is again seen prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings with more nodular areas at the upper lobes consistent with known lung cancer, unchanged from prior. Small bilateral effusions are seen. There are no pneumothoraces. Suture material is seen within the left upper lung.
