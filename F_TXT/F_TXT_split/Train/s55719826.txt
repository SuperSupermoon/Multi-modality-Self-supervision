Single portable AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube its tip which terminates approximately 9 cm above the level of the carina. This should be advanced approximately 4 cm for more appropriate positioning. An enteric tube descends the thorax in an uncomplicated course, its tip which projects over the left upper quadrant. A right central line is identified, its tip at the upper right atrium. Lung volumes are low. Heart size appears within normal limits. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. No overt pulmonary edema, large pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures are without an acute abnormality.
