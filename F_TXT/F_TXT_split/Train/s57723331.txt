In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube has been re-positioned so that the tip lies over the level of the left hilum. No evidence of pneumothorax, though subcutaneous gas persists along the lower left chest and upper abdomen. Area of opacification at the left base persists. Although this could merely represent atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
