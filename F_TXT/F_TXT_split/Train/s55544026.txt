A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube is low, ending 1.5 cm above the carina. This could be pulled back to avoid bronchial intubation. A new Dobbhoff tube ends in the stomach. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Left basilar opacity is likely atelectasis. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
