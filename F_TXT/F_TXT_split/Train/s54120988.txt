Comparison is made with prior study, ___. The endotracheal tube is difficult to visualize, appears to be in appropriate position. Right PICC tip is in the cavoatrial junction. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions have increased on the left, probably unchanged on the right allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. There are increasing opacities in the left lower lobe. These are worrisome for aspiration. There is also increase in atelectasis in the left lower lobe. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
