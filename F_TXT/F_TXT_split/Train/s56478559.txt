In comparison with study of ___, there are somewhat lower lung volumes. The portable rather than upright PA technique makes it somewhat difficult to assess the degree of pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis. No evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. Again there is evidence of colonic interposition between the liver and right hemidiaphragm.
