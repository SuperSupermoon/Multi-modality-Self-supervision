Single portable view of the chest. No prior. Endotracheal tube is seen with tip approximately 4 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube seen off the inferior field of view, side port just past the GE junction. Lungs are clear of focal consolidation. Small calcific density projecting over the anterior left first rib could be calcified granuloma or potentially a bone island. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits noting a slightly tortuous aorta with some atherosclerotic calcifications. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
