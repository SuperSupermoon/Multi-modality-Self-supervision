Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. A slight increase in interstitial markings bilaterally may be due to minimal interstitial edema versus less likely atypical infection. No lobar consolidation is seen. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggesting a trace pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
