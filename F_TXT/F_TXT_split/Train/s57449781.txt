As compared to the prior radiograph, there is mild interstitial pulmonary edema. The opacity in the left lower lobe, likely atelectasis, is improving. Left pleural effusion is slightly smaller. There is no new parenchymal opacity to suggest pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. A right PICC catheter terminates in the lower SVC. There is a feeding tube coiled within the stomach. Osseous structures demonstrate multiple healed rib fractures.
