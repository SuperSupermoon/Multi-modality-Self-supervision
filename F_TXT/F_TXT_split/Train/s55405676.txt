In comparison with the study of ___, there has been a thoracentesis on the right with substantial reduction in pleural fluid and no evidence of pneumothorax. Opacification at the right base is consistent with some combination of residual pleural effusion, atelectasis, and re-expansion edema of the previously collapsed portion of the lower right lung. There is some increased indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels. This could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure, though it also could be a manifestation of the AP supine view when compared to the previous erect PA projection.
