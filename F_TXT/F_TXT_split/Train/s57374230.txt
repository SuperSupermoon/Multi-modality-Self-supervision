ET tube is 5 cm above the carina. Interval placement of NG tube as well with distal portion traversing B on the diaphragm and extending beyond the lower margins of the film. Right subclavian PICC with tip in the SVC, position unchanged. Low lung volumes bilaterally. There is a new left mid lung opacity consistent with pneumonia. There is increased opacity in the left lung base obscuring the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe collapse and pleural effusion. There is inferior displacement of the minor fissures consistent with volume loss and increased collapse of the right middle lobe. Cardiac size appears enlarged in this portable view but unchanged from previous. There is no pneumothorax.
