Assessment is slightly limited due to patient rotation. The nasogastric tube tip terminates within the stomach. Lung volumes are low resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures. Heart size is moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Streaky opacities in the lung bases could reflect atelectasis but aspiration or infection cannot be excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Multiple displaced right-sided rib fractures are noted with adjacent hazy opacification in the peripheral aspect of the right lung base. Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are seen.
