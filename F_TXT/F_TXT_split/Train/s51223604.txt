As compared to the previous examination, the monitoring and support devices, including the known ventriculoperitoneal shunt, show unchanged position. The size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be at the upper range of normal. The radiographic signs indicative of pneumomediastinum, verified by CT, and the lucency along the left heart border, present on the previous image, are clearly decreased. A pre-existing opacity at the right lung base is also smaller than on the previous image. There currently is no evidence of pneumothorax, but air in the left cervical soft tissues continue to be present. No new parenchymal opacities.
