Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Lung volumes remain low. This results in some crowding of bronchovascular structures at the lung bases. Apparent streaky peribronchiolar opacities in the lower lobes could reflect atelectasis, aspiration or a developing bronchopneumonia. Repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be helpful for initial further evaluation.
