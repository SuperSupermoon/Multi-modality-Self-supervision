Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated, is obscured by pleural parenchymal abnormalities. Right IJ catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction. There is worsening consolidation in the periphery of the right mid hemothorax and right lower lobe. This likely is a combination of worsening loss of volume and superimposed infection. Amount of pleural effusion cannot be assessed. The left lung is clear aside from medial post-radiation changes better seen in prior CT. On the left, there is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
