AP chest compared to 2:05 p.m. Diffuse pulmonary infiltration has worsened over the past three hours. In the absence of cardiomegaly or mediastinal venous engorgement, this cannot be attributed to simple pulmonary edema. Instead, diffuse alveolar damage, severe aspiration, and pulmonary hemorrhage should be considered instead. Right pleural tube still in place. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Previous mammoth colonic distension has been treated. Drains are noted in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen. ET tube ends at the thoracic inlet, upper enteric drain ends in the lower esophagus and would need to be advanced at least 15 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. Esophageal manometer or temperature probe is in place. Left internal jugular sheath ends just above the thoracic inlet and a right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC.
