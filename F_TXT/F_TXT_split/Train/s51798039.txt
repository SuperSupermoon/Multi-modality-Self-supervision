As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight increase in severity of pulmonary edema, notably on the right. The large consolidation at the left lung bases has slightly decreased in severity. On the other hand, a pre-existing atelectasis at the right base has increased. There is unchanged evidence of a small left pleural effusion and of moderate cardiomegaly.
