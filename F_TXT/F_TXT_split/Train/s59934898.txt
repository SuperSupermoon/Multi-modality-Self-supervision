A right-sided chest tube has been removed. Right internal jugular and left-sided PICC lines appear unchanged, both terminating in the superior vena cava. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The lung volumes are low. Patchy basilar opacities are unchanged and are most suggestive of atelectasis. There is no definite pneumothorax.
