Interval placement of nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm with its tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach. Patchy bibasilar opacities remain in the setting of low lung volumes favoring atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Crowding of pulmonary vasculature with no overt pulmonary edema. Possible small bilateral effusions. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax. Pneumoperitoneum is still present but less apparent due to differences in positioning.
