Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. There are increased streaky opacities at the bilateral bases which likely represent atelectasis, however superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Perihilar prominence of vessels suggests pulmonary vascular engorgement. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
