AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained on ___. Remarkable is that the heart size has increased during the latest 24 hours examination interval. There is no typical configurational abnormality, but the finding could be explained by increasing circulating blood volume. The pulmonary vasculature is slightly more distended but does not show any evidence of extravasation in the form of interstitial or alveolar edema and the lateral pleural sinus remain free. No evidence of new acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are seen. No pneumothorax existing in the apical area. Remarkable is that the previously described right-sided PICC line projects now with its tip into the upper portion of the right atrium. This may be related to the described increase of the heart volume unless the PICC line has been advanced inadvertently. Observe that PICC line may cause mechanical arrhythmias if in contact with the right atrial wall.
