The ET tube, NG tube, and right IJ line have been removed. The dual-lead pacemaker is still in place. There continues to be moderate cardiomegaly. There is dense retrocardiac opacity consistent with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. There is a small right effusion as well and low lung volumes in the right lower lobe. Compared to the prior exam, the effusions are left greater than right and the amount of retrocardiac opacity is increased.
