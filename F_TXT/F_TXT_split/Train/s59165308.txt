Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 6.7 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, coiling in the expected location of the gastric fundus. Mild bibasilar opacities are seen, right greater than left, which could relate to aspiration though an early infectious process cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The aorta is calcified.
