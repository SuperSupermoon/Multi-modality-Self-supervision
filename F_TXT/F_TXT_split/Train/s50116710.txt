As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged subtotal opacification of the left hemi thorax. Monitoring and support devices are overall constant, but the left PICC line is now located in the azygos vein. A new endotracheal tube projects approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. A minimal increase in radiodensity at the bases of the right lung is likely caused by atelectasis.
