As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of a right internal jugular vein catheter, of a nasogastric tube that projects over the proximal parts of the stomach and has been pulled back, as well as of a endotracheal tube that is positioned slightly to I. The pre-existing mild but widespread parenchymal opacities are unchanged in extent and severity. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
