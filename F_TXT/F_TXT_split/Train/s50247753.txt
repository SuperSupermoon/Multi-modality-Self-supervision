In comparison to the prior radiograph, there is now increased fluid in the oblique fissure as well as an increase in the apical fluid. A left-sided subclavian line terminates at the confluence of brachiocephalic and the SVC. Slight increase in the bibasilar opacities could represent an early infectious process. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
