PA and lateral chest compared to ___: Pulmonary vasculature, including the hila and upper lobe vessels is more engorged today than it was on ___, but there is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion and no consolidation to suggest pneumonia. I would consider reevaluate with conventional radiographs if feasible in order to decide whether CT scanning is indicated to detect subtle infection. Right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC. No pleural effusion. Adenopathy could be responsible for the interval increase in caliber of the hila, but there is no strong evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
