The right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC. There is an enteric tube, which extends below the diaphragm; however, the tip is out of view of this film. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable with interval improvement of bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion. Lungs appear better aerated. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
