Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the region of the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. No large pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. Hazy opacification of the right hemithorax likely reflects a large layering right pleural effusion. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. Mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged. No focal consolidation or overt pulmonary edema is clearly evident. Rotary dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is again noted.
