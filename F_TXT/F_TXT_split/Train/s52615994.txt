As compared to radiograph two days prior, there is notable improvement in pulmonary edema, especially evident at the apices. However, bilateral lower lung opacities persist and are concerning for pneumonia. A small right pleural effusion is likely still present but incompletely evaluated on this frontal radiograph. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Tortuosity and calcification of the thoracic aorta is redemonstrated.
