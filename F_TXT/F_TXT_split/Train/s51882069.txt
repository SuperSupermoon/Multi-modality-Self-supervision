In comparison to prior radiograph from 1.5 Hr earlier, a left internal jugular catheter has been advanced or replaced, now crossing the midline and terminating within the right brachiocephalic vein. This has subsequently been repositioned on a later chest radiograph from the same date, dictated separately. No pneumothorax and no other relevant change since the recent exam.
