Tracheostomy tube is in situ and in standard position. Feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm into the stomach, however, the distal end is beyond the radiograph's view. Dual-lumen catheter through the right subclavian approach terminates low into the right atrium. Another catheter on the right side of neck with its lower end coursing laterally towards axilla was not seen in previous radiograph and is mostly external, overlying the patient. Clinical correlation is need for further confirmation. Bilateral lung volumes are persistently low. Mild bibasal atelectasis is present. There are no new lung opacities of concern. Bilateral pleural effusions if any are small and unchanged. Cardiomediastinal contour is stable. Right upper quadrant abdominal drain is incompletely imaged.
