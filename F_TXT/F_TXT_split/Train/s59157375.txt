AP chest compared to ___ at 9 a.m.: This supine chest radiograph is compared to an earlier upright or semi-erect one. It shows a clear decrease in the size of previously moderate to large right pleural effusion, but I cannot assess whether there has been any decrease in caliber of the large cardiomediastinal silhouette and the moderate left pleural effusion layering posteriorly cannot be compared to the volume of pleural fluid dependent on the earlier study. Pulmonary edema is minimal if any despite the very low lung volumes. New pericardiocentesis catheter in left paramedian position ascends to the level of the aortopulmonic window. Dialysis catheter set ends in the low SVC and upper right atrium. No pneumothorax.
