Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The right chest tube has been removed. There is subcutaneous air in the chest wall developed in the interim. The opacity projecting over the mid lungs appears to be minimally increased, concerning for either pleural effusion or hematoma within the lungs. The rest of the findings are unchanged.
