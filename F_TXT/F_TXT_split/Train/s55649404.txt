Severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality, is probably the fibrotic residual of recent diffuse alveolar damage, responsible for very low lung volumes. It is interesting to note that prior to this illness there was evidence of developing interstitial lung disease. It is impossible to know whether the lungs are currently capable of looking any better. For example in the axillary region of the left lung there could be an acute pneumonia. Baseline chest radiograph should be obtained when the patient is in optimal pulmonary condition. Heart is normal size and pleural effusion is minimal if any. There is no pneumothorax.
