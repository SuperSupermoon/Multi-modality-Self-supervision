The Dobbhoff tube is now straightened, but the opaque portion crosses the esophagogastric junction. The tube should be pushed forward several centimeters if possible. Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. There is evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion with bibasilar opacification and obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm. Although this may merely reflect pleural effusion and atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
