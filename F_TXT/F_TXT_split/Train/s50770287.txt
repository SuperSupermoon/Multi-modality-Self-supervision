Cardiomegaly is substantial. The aortic arch appears to be substantially distended with significant right shift of the trachea and should be further correlated with chest CT to exclude the possibility of thoracic aneurysm. The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. Lungs are essentially clear. No appreciable pleural effusion is seen. No pulmonary edema is demonstrated.
