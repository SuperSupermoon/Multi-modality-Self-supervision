The cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta remains tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications at the knob. There are low lung volumes with crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, but the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. No acutely displaced fractures are evident. Remote compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body is unchanged.
