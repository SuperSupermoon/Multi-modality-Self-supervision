Endotracheal tube tip is seen 3.3 cm from the carina. Enteric tube tip seen in the region of the gastric body. There is biapical scarring. Vague opacities seen in the lungs bilaterally are largely in part due to calcification of the costochondral cartilage noting underlying parenchymal opacity is entirely possible. Additional opacity projecting over left upper is at least in part external due to overlying respiratory tubing. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the arch.
