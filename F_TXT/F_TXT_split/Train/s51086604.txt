As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. There is increasing evidence of bilateral basal parenchymal opacities as well as fluid marking of the minor fissure on the right and slight dilatation of the pulmonary vessels. Simultaneously, there is new blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, probably caused by a small right pleural effusion. Overall, the findings are suggestive of mild to moderate hydrostatic pulmonary edema. No convincing evidence of pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
