As compared to the previous radiograph, the known right thorax was drained with a pigtail catheter. There is a tiny remnant right apical pneumothorax. No evidence of tension. The right pigtail catheter appears to be in correct position. All other monitoring and support devices are constant. Unchanged minimal pneumopericardium.
