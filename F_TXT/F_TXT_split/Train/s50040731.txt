The position of the various lines and tubes is unchanged. A left chest tube is present. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are again noted. Increased opacities are seen in the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac region, which could represent an area of aspiration pneumonia. This was not present on the prior chest x-ray.
