AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. There is status post left upper lobectomy with the left-sided chest tube in unchanged position, reaching well into the left apical area. Sparsity of pulmonary vasculature in this area is explained by compensatory hypoinflation of the remaining left lower lobe. There is no conclusive evidence for any pneumothorax in the area, but followup examinations are recommended. The local chest wall emphysema at the entrance of the left-sided chest tube has decreased markedly, and there is no evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates or pleural effusions.
