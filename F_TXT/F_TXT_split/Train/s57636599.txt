Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and asymmetrical right perihilar opacities as well as bilateral peripheral interstitial abnormality. Observed findings most likely represent asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but followup radiograph after diuresis would be helpful to ensure resolution and to exclude other process in the right lung such as infection or aspiration. Bilateral small pleural effusions are also evident as well as a linear focus of atelectasis at the right base.
