Moderate right and small left pleural effusions have increased since ___. Moderate cardiomegaly and borderline pulmonary vascular congestion are unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumonia. There may be more atelectasis in the left lower lobe but it is hard to say whether that is not due instead to more fluid retained in the large hiatus hernia. No pneumothorax. Thoracic aorta and mitral annulus are heavily calcified.
