In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter again extends to the lower SVC. Continued low lung volumes accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure persists. Obscuration of the hemidiaphragm with retrocardiac opacification is consistent with pleural fluid and substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. Less prominent effusion and atelectatic changes at the right base.
