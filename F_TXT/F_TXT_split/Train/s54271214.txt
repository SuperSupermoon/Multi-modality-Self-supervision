Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There is persistent collapse of the right lower lobe and probably right middle lobe. Increasing opacities in the left lower lobe are consistent with increase in atelectasis and left effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly cannot be assessed. Pacer leads and right PICC are in unchanged standard positions.
