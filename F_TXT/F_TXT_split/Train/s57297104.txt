As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial increase in extent of the right pleural effusion with subsequent areas of atelectasis in the right lung. On the left, the atelectatic areas in the retrocardiac space are of unchanged extent. The appearance of the left hilus suggests moderate pulmonary edema. Given the right effusion, the size of the cardiac silhouette cannot be exactly determined. The monitoring and support devices are now in correct position, with the Swan-Ganz catheter pulled back by approximately 2 to 3 cm.
