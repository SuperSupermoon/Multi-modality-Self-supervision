As compared to ___ radiograph, enlarged cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vascular engorgement are persistent findings. Asymmetrically distributed combined alveolar and interstitial pattern has slightly worsened. Although possibly due to asymmetrical edema, superimposed infectious process should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. As some of the opacities in the right lung have a somewhat nodular contour, followup radiographs to ensure complete resolution are suggested. Small right pleural effusion is also demonstrated, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
