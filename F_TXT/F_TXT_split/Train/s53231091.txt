Lung volumes are lower than on the prior study. Since ___, left basilar opacity, likely atelectasis, and moderate left pleural effusion have significantly increased. There is right basilar atelectasis and probably a small right pleural effusion. A catheter projects over the right hemithorax. There has been interval removal of a left thoracic catheter. Right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. No appreciable left pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
