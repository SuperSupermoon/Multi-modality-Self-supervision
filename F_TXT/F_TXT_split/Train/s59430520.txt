The left basilar pigtail catheter has been removed and there has been interval reaccumulation of loculated left-sided pleural effusion, likely with mild superimposed atelectasis given left-sided volume loss. The previously seen left basilar pneumothorax has resolved. Parenchymal changes related to emphysema appear stable from prior studies without evidence of focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.
