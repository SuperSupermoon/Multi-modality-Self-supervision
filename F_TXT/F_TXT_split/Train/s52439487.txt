In comparison with the study of ___, there is again seen gaseous distention of large bowel and focal small bowel loops, measuring up to 5.3 cm. This is consistent with a severe abdominal ileus, though the possibility of a distal obstruction would have to be assessed by CT if clinically warranted. The nasogastric tube now appears to extend to the upper stomach or gastroesophageal junction. Again it should be pushed further, so that the side hole would be entirely within the stomach. The hazy opacification of the left hemithorax is somewhat less evident, though there is more opacification along the lateral chest wall. It is difficult to assess whether there has been substantial change in the degree of pleural effusion. Small effusion and atelectatic changes at the right base persists. Opacification of the left hemithorax with retrocardiac opacity is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Specifically, there is no radiographic evidence of free intraperitoneal gas. However, this is not a true erect view so that pneumoperitoneum cannot be excluded. If this is a serious clinical concern, CT would be necessary for further evaluation.
