1. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning. Overall, the lungs are well inflated without evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax. There is a faint asymmetry at the right lung base when compared to the left, but this appears to have been present on prior studies at least dating back to ___ and may reflect chronic post-inflammatory changes rather than an acute infectious process. Clinical correlation is advised and followup imaging should be based on the clinical assessment. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. A gastric tube is once again identified overlying the left upper quadrant.
