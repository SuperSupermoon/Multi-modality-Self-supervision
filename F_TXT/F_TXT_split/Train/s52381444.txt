There are relatively low lung volumes and basilar atelectasis. Left base opacity may be due to atelectasis however, underlying consolidation due to pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
