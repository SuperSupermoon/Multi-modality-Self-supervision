Portable semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube tip located 4.2 cm from the level of the carina. A left chest port tip is located in the lower SVC. Right upper extremity PICC tip is located near the cavoatrial junction. Right upper lobe consolidation with bronchiectasis and volume loss is unchanged. The left lung is no worse from priors, with dense airspace and interstitial opacity. Right lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusion is little changed. A gastrostomy tube is unchanged.
