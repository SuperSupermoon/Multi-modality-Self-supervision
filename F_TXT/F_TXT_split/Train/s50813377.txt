AP portable supine view of the chest. 2 discrete round metallic densities project over the heart, likely external. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip positioned 4.7 cm above the carina. The NG tube passes into the left upper abdomen. There is a linear density in the left lower lung which may represent atelectasis. Adjacent vague opacity is also noted, possibly representing aspiration or pneumonia. The right lung is clear. No supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable. No acute bony injuries.
