As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an unchanged postoperative appearance of the right hemithorax. No pneumothorax can be identified. The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. At the right lung base, a small platelike atelectasis has newly occurred. On the left, there is minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting the presence of a small left pleural effusion. The left lower lobe atelectasis and the size of the cardiac silhouette are constant.
