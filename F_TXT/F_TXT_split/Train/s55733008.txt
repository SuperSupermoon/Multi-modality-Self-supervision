Heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are unremarkable. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Calcified hilar lymph nodes likely reflect prior granulomatous disease. Additionally, small calcified nodules are seen in the right lung base also likely reflective of granulomas. The lateral right hemithorax is excluded from the field of view. Minimal left basilar streaky atelectasis is noted. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
