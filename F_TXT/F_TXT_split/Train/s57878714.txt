In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. There appears to be increased opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm and left heart border, consistent with pleural fluid and substantial volume loss in the lingula and left lower lobe. Increased obliquity of the patient makes it difficult to assess whether there has been appreciable mediastinal shift to the left. The pulmonary vessels appear more engorged and indistinct, suggesting some increasing pulmonary venous pressure.
