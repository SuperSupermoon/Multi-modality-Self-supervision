After thoracentesis there has been interval decrease of right base pleural effusion, now small. There is also new small pneumothorax at the right costophrenic angle. Increased opacification at the right lung base is likely related to moderate post-procedural edema. The lung is otherwise clear except for linear opacity at the left lung base compatible with atelectasis. Heart size still moderately enlarged.
