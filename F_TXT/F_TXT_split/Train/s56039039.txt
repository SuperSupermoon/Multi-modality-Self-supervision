1. Interval removal of the right-sided chest tube. There is a persistent nodular appearance to the right lateral and basilar pleural opacities which likely represent a combination of known pleural metastases and fluid. Overall, when compared to the most recent plain film study, there has been slight interval decrease in aeration within the right mid and lower lung. Left lung remains grossly clear. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable though somewhat difficult to assess due to the pleural abnormality involving the right hemithorax. No appreciable pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
