Since the prior study there has been interval addition of the distal trachea stent to already pre-existing left main bronchus stent. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Right basal opacity has developed and might potentially reflect interval aspiration, attention on the subsequent study is recommended. No interval development of pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen. The patient did demonstrate persistent decrease in volume of the left hemothorax most likely related to prior surgery.
