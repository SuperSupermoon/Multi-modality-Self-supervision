Since the prior exam, there is increased opacification of the right lung with associated volume loss. A right pleural effusion appears unchanged. Post-surgical changes at the right apex are stable. There is persistent rightward tracheal deviation, which is stable. Worsening left lower lobe opacification could be due to an increasing pleural effusion or a new consolidation. Diffuse interstitial opacities appear to be worsened, suggestive of increasing pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to evaluate given the pulmonary abnormalities. It appears unchanged.
