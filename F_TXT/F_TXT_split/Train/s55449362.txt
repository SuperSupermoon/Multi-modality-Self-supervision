In comparison with the study ___ ___, the monitoring and support devices have been removed. Obliquity of the patient makes it somewhat difficult to compare the appearance of the heart and lungs. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and there is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural fluid atelectatic changes. There is the suggestion of patchy areas of opacification in the mid and lower lung on the left when compared to the opposite side. In view of the clinical history, the possibility of superimposed aspiration would be impossible to exclude. If the condition of the patient permits, a full PA and lateral chest series would be most helpful.
