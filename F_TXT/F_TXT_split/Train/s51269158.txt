Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Severe pulmonary edema has minimally increased. Widened mediastinum and cardiomegaly are stable. Left IJ catheter is in unchanged position at the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and upper SVC. Right PICC tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC. There is no evident pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are larger on the left side.
