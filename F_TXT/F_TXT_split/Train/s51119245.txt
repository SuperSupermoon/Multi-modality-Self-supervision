Right pleural effusion has mildly improved since prior. No pneumothorax. Stable right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis, consider pneumonitis in the appropriate clinical setting. Improved left perihilar, basilar opacity. Possible tiny left pleural effusion. Improved heart size, pulmonary vascularity, likely secondary to better inspiration.
