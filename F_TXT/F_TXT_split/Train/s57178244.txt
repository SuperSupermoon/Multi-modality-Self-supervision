Single portable view of the chest. Tracheostomy tube is identified. G tube not included on this film. Streaky left midlung opacity is consistent with probable scarring. The left hemidiaphragm is not particularly well seen which may be in part projectional and is unchanged from priors. Persistent minimal retrocardiac opacity. The lungs elsewhere are clear and the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications again noted at the arch. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
