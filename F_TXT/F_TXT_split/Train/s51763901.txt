Relatively uniform widespread pulmonary opacification developed between ___ and ___ accompanied by increasing mediastinal and pulmonary vascular caliber, improved slightly on ___, subsequently unchanged though looking worse because of lower lung volumes. Left lower lobe opacification is probably atelectasis though pneumonia is not excluded and small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are present and probably increased since ___. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Overall findings point to volume dependent pulmonary edema. Small nodular opacity projecting over the right costo sternal junction could be superimposition of normal structures. It should be re-evaluated when edema has improved. ET tube and nasogastric drainage tube in standard placements respectively. No pneumothorax.
