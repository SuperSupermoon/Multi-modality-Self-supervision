Single frontal AP upright portable chest radiograph was provided. The heart is moderately enlarged. Curvilinear calcification projecting over the heart likely represents mitral annular calcification. The aorta is somewhat unfolded. The lungs appear clear. Subtle opacity projecting over the right mid lung at the site of rib overlap likely reflects summation of shadows. No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
