Portable frontal radiograph of the lower chest and upper abdomen demonstrates an NG tube curled within an air-filled distended stomach. The right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged position ending in the SVC. A left chest tube is unchanged. There is stable mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bibasilar atelectasis. A left pneumothorax is again present, but this study is not technically sufficient to see both the NG tube and assess the pneumothorax
