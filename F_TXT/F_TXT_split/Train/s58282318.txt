Again seen is hazy opacification of the bilateral lungs, most likely representing pulmonary edema, although may be infection, ARDS, or pulmonary hemorrhage. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged and stable. Small bilateral effusions are unchanged. An opacification at the right base most likely represents atelectasis, although a developing infection cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Pacemaker electrodes are in standard position.
