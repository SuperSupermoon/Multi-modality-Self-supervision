New left pectoral pacemaker has two leads. The first one is in adequate position in the right atrium, the second one seems to be high for a ventricular lead. If it was not intended to be in the sinus coronary, a standard PA and lateral chest x-ray is suggested to assess the exact position. The lung volumes are low. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
