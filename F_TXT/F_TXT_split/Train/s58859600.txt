Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates multiple EKG leads projecting over the thorax limiting underlying assessment. The lung volumes are low accentuating a prominent cardiac silhouette which is likely accentuated by AP technique. There are left greater than right bilateral pleural effusions. Retrocardiac opacity likely represents consolidation admixed with compressive atelectasis upon correlation with prior CT. Scattered perihilar right greater than left opacities on correlation with preceding CT represent multifocal consolidation and cavitary sequela of septic emboli. There is no pneumothorax. Median sternotomy wires are in place.
