As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased, likely a result of decreased ventilatory pressure. A pre-existing pleural effusion on the left has mildly increased in extent and severity. On the right, the pleural effusion is constant. The pre-existing atelectatic parenchymal opacities are unchanged in distribution and extent. There is no evidence of new parenchymal opacities. Mild increase in size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
