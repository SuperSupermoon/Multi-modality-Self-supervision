In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a right PICC has apparently been repositioned, now terminating at the medial aspect of the right clavicle at the expected junction of the right subclavian and brachiocephalic veins, previously extending below this level within the superior vena cava. Appearance of the right hemi thorax is unchanged. In the left hemi thorax, a pleural effusion has decreased in size with associated improved aeration at the left base. No other relevant changes.
