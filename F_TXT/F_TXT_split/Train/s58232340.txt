AP chest compared to ___, 11:43 a.m.: There has been a slight increase in aeration in the right lower lung, due to either some withdrawal of right pleural effusion, although I no longer can see the Pleurx catheter at the base of the right chest, or some improvement in what is most likely severe obstruction to the right middle and lower lobe. Rightward mediastinal shift is mild but unchanged. There is no right pneumothorax. Diffuse micronodular and linear interstitial abnormality in the left lung is probably a combination of edema and disseminated tumor or at least lymphatic occlusion. A drainage catheter traverses the right neck, chest and upper abdomen.
