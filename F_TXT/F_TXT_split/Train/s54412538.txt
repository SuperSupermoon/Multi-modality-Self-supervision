As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The lung volumes have slightly decreased, likely reflecting a decrease ventilatory pressure. The endotracheal tube remains low, with its tip projecting 1 cm above the carina. The device should be pulled back by 1-2 cm. Slightly increasing right basal and retrocardiac atelectasis. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
