In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change in the substantial left pleural effusion with compensatory volume loss in the left lower lobe. There are somewhat lower lung volumes. Nasogastric tube is in unchanged position. No definite evidence for acute pneumonia. However, this would be difficult to unequivocally exclude given the extensive changes in the lower left lung an the absence of a lateral view.
