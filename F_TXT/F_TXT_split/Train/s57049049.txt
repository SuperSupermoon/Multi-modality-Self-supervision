Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier. Again noted there is re-distribution of the pleural effusions due to difference in positioning of the patient. The pleural effusions are large, minimally decreased on the right but stable on the left associated with adjacent left greater than right atelectasis. There is stable mild vascular congestion. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position.
