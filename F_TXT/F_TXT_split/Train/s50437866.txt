CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An NG tube is present, tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off film. A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle. Right IJ central line tip over distal SVC. There is probable background hyperinflation, suggesting COPD. There is cardiomegaly. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There are small-to-moderate sized bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Compared with a ___, at 4:54 a.m., the CHF findings are slightly improved. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
