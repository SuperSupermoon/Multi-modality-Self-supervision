The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The hilar contours are within normal limits. There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base. Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles is likely secondary to a small amount of pleural effusion. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
