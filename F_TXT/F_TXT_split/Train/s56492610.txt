An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.7 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm. off film. A right IJ central line is present, tip over mid SVC. Compared with ___ at 9:52 a.m., I doubt significant interval change. There is increased opacity at both lung bases, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation and possible small effusions. There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. The cardiomediastinal silhouette may be slightly less pronounced, but borders are obscured by the basilar opacities and technique and there may be differences in magnification between the two films.
