A right PICC tip terminates in the lower SVC. No definite pneumothorax is seen, though the patient's chin obscures the lung apices. The heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with aortic knob calcifications redemonstrated. Streaky opacities in the lung bases are present, likely reflective of atelectasis. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. No pleural effusion is present.
