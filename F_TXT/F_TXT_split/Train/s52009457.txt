Interstitial opacities in the lung bases appear similar compared to prior examination and correspond with areas of interstitial thickening and fibrosis seen on prior CT. No confluent consolidation is identified. There is no overt pulmonary edema or large effusions. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Severe deformities of the bilateral shoulders appear chronic. Multiple subacute left-sided rib fractures are newly identified, though of indeterminate age.
