In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the PleurX catheter is again seen and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. The left PICC line is difficult to see, though still probably is within the brachiocephalic vein. Areas of opacification at the left base again are consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and possible small pleural effusion.
