Portable supine AP view of the chest was provided. The NG tube courses inferiorly below the diaphragm, though the tip is not within the imaged field. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 2.6 cm above the carina. Small right pleural effusion is noted. This is unchanged. Suture material is again noted at the right lung base. Otherwise, no change. The patient is slightly rotated to her right which somewhat limits evaluation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, though there is no significant change. Sternotomy closure devices and prosthetic cardiac valve are re-imaged.
