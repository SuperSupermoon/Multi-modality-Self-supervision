As compared to the previous radiograph, volumes have slightly decreased, likely reflecting a lesser inspiratory effort. There is unchanged evidence of moderate cardiomegaly as well as bilateral pleural effusions and subsequent areas of atelectasis. The changes are more severe on the left than on the right. In the interval, there is no evidence of new parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax. No convincing evidence of pulmonary edema. The sternal wires and the right internal jugular vein catheter are in constant position.
