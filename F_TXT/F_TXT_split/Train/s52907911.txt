AP portable supine view of the chest. There has been interval intubation with the tip of the endotracheal tube residing approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. Since the prior exam, there is increasing bilateral atelectasis and ill-defined opacities within the lungs, left greater than right, raising concern for interval aspiration. A component of mild edema is difficult to exclude. No supine evidence for large effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly stable though difficult to assess given technique. No acute bony abnormalities.
