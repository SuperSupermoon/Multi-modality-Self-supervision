AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are slightly low and pulmonary vascular caliber slightly greater following tracheal extubation, but there is no pulmonary edema. Left lower lobe remains consolidated, but there is less volume loss. I suggest careful followup to detect worsening aeration in the left lung, and at the right lung base. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. Other lines and tubes in standard placements. No pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion persists.
