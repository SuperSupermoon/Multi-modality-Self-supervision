Consolidation in the right mid and lower lung, accompanied by moderate right pleural effusion, is worsening, probably progression of a large pneumonia. Pulmonary vascular congestion, and a smaller region of consolidation in the left lower lobe are stable. Heart size is indeterminate, but chronic moderate to severe enlargement is probably still present. Moderate left pleural effusion unchanged.
