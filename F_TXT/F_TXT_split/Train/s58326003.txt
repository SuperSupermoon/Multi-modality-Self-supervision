Endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of view. Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities are increased at the bases with relative decrease in the previously described perihilar component. Given the migration of the opacities, edema is favored. Heart size is normal suggesting noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, a finding which can be seen in major and minor transfusion reactions.
