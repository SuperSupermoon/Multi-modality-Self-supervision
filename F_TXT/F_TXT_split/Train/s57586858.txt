In comparison with the study of ___, there again is diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, which appear somewhat less prominent than on the previous study. Again, this most likely represents pulmonary edema, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia or even ARDS would have to be considered. Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases are again seen. The right subclavian PICC line again extends only to the upper to midportion of the SVC.
