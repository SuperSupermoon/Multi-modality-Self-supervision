Single portable upright chest radiograph. Relative lucency of the bilateral upper lungs suggests background emphysematous changes. Bibasilar opacifications identified, left greater than right. Right-sided opacification may merely represent crowding and atelectasis; however, more dense opacification on the left may reflect atelectasis, combined with small effusion versus developing pneumonia. Please note, the lung apices are excluded from view by the patient's overlying chin.
