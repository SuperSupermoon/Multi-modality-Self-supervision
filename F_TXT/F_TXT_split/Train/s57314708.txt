The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the thoracic inlet approximately 6 cm above the carina. There is a U rounded opacity in the right infrahilar region silhouetting the right hilus and right heart border. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema. Streaky opacities at the right lung base may reflect atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The mediastinal contours are prominent, likely due in part to unfolding of the thoracic aorta. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated.
