As compared to the previous radiograph, there is mild decrease in extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities. The extent and severity of these opacities, however, is still massive. The distribution of the findings suggests fluid overload rather than pneumonia. A left pleural effusion is constant in appearance. Constant retrocardiac atelectasis. The monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Unchanged absence of pneumothorax.
