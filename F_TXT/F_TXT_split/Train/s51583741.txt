AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right-sided pacemaker demonstrates unchanged fracture of the lead with one of the leads pacing the right ventricle. The second lead is unremarkable. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with prominence of the azygos area, consistent most likely with chronic vascular engorgement. There is no overt pulmonary edema but diffuse vascular engorgement is seen including the lung bases where areas of bibasal atelectasis versus developing right lower lobe infectious process and left retrocardiac infectious process are seen. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
