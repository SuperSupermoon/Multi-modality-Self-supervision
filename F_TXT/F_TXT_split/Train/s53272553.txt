In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the nasogastric tube lies in the upper stomach. The side hole is probably just distal to the esophagogastric junction and the tube should be pushed forward somewhat. Endotracheal tube is in good position above the carina. Increased opacification in the retrocardiac region with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm and blunting of the costophrenic angle is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. There is engorgement of ill-defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with some degree of pulmonary edema. Some prominence in the azygos region raises the possibility of right-sided heart failure as well.
