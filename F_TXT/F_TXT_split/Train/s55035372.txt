Left subclavian central line, nasogastric tube, endotracheal tube are unchanged in position. There is interval improvement in the vascular congestion. A streaky linear opacity at the right base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. A subtle radiopaque oval opacity in the left lateral mid lung field is again noted and may be pleural in etiology. No pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax.
