The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable in comparison to priors. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. Again seen is hazy opacity of the left lower lung, likely related to overlying breast tissue, as on multiple prior exams. There is no definite focal lung consolidation. There are low lung volumes. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. There is no right pleural effusion. A trace left pleural effusion is difficult to exclude given overlying soft tissue.
