In comparison with chest radiograph from ___, bilateral symmetric airspace opacities have worsened, particularly in the left mid lung and right lower lung, most consistent with multifocal pneumonia, though pulmonary edema, ARDS and alveolar hemorrhage cannot be definitively excluded. Possible loculated left pleural effusion along the periphery of the left lower hemithorax is difficult to assess, though does not appear to be significantly worse. No other relevant change.
