As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube is also removed. The remaining monitoring and support devices, including the bilateral chest tubes, are in unchanged position. As a consequence of extubation, the lung volumes have substantially decreased. This has caused new bilateral areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases. To exclude developing pneumonia, however, short-term radiographic followup should be performed. There is no evidence of pneumothorax and no larger pleural effusions are present. No pulmonary edema. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
