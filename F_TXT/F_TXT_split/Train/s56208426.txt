AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The ET tube has been inserted with its tip terminating too low, approximately 2 cm above the carina and should be pulled back for additional 1.5-2 cm. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. Atelectasis in the right middle lobe is unchanged and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
