Single AP view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. Relative right base opacity most likely relates to atelectasis, although early consolidation from infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting and could consider repeat PA and lateral views with deeper inspiration when patient able. Bilateral diaphragmatic and pleural plaques seen to suggest prior asbestos exposure. Cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Hilar contours may be accentuated by AP technique.
