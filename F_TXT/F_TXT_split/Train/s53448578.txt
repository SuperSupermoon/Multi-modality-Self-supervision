Previous median sternotomy noted. Monitoring and supportive equipment is unchanged compared to the prior study. Persistent moderate cardiomegaly with prominence of the bilateral hila and pulmonary vessels consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion. Left lower lobe atelectasis. Airspace opacity at the right lung base likely reflects pulmonary edema but infection cannot be excluded.
