Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate an ET tube in position with the tip 3.5 cm above the carina. There is no pneumothorax or other complication seen. There has been significant interval increase in vascular congestion along with loss of definition of both hemidiaphragms and increased cardiac shadow size, suggestive of a new mild interstitial edema. Bilateral pleural effusions are visualized. NG tube is seen in appropriate position with the tip and side port within the stomach.
