In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly with enlarged and tortuous thoracic aorta persist, without evidence of pulmonary edema. The area of possible loculated pneumothorax at the left base is not appreciated at this time. The right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip now appears to be well within the right pulmonary artery.
