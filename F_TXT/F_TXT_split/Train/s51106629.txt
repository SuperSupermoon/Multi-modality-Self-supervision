Supine portable frontal chest radiograph shows a NG tube terminating a ___ portion of the duodenum. A right upper extremity PICC has been withdrawn in the interim, now terminating at the confluence of the right brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava. The lung volumes remain low, which accentuates the bronchovascular structures. There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
