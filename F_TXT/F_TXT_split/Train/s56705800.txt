In comparison with study of ___, there is a right IJ catheter that extends to the mid portion of the SVC. No evidence of pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes. Nevertheless, there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobes. Blunting of the costophrenic angle on that side is consistent with a small effusion.
