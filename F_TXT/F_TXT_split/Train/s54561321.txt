Mild interstitial edema is unchanged but opacification in the right lower chest has increased. Some of this could be due to dependent edema, some to increasing right pleural effusion, but the major concern is for developing pneumonia. Left infrahilar consolidation has been constant, either pneumonia or atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. No pneumothorax. With the chin down, ET tube position at thoracic inlet is acceptable. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right pic line ends in the upper right atrium.
