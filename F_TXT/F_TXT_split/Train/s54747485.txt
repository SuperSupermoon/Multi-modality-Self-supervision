In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. The tip of the Swan-___ catheter again extends into the right pulmonary artery beyond the mediastinal border. Loculated pleural effusion within the major fissure on the right is essentially unchanged. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is again seen with mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is again noted.
