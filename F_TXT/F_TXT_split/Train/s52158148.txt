Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study. There is persistent moderate cardiomegaly. The right upper lobe airspace opacity now appears more confluent with air bronchograms. This could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema but infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen. The visualized bony structures are unremarkable in appearance.
