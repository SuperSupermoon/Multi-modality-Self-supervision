AP chest compared to ___ through ___: There is no pulmonary edema. Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is probably unchanged, though partially obscured by the right hemidiaphragm, behind which the left lower lobe is consolidated, more likely atelectasis than pneumonia. Upper lungs are clear. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses, unchanged.
