Multiple median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips, as well as cholecystectomy clips overlying the right upper quadrant, are again identified. The aortic arch is calcified. There is stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The bilateral hila are within normal limits. Diffuse interstitial prominence is unchanged from prior exams. There is no focal confluent lung consolidation. As on prior radiograph, blunting of the bilateral lateral costophrenic angles suggests trace bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. There is moderate thoracic spine levoscoliosis.
