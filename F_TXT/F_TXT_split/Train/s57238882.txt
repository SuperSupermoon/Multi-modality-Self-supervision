Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 5 cm above the level of the carina. There has also been interval placement of an enteric tube coursing below the level of the diaphragm, extending into the expected location of the stomach in the left upper quadrant. There is slight increase in prominence of the hila which may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement/developing edema. There is minimal left basilar atelectasis. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
