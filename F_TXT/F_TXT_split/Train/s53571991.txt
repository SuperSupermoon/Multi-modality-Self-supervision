As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. Existing areas of opacities at both the left and the right lung have decreased in extent and are barely visible on today's image. However, blunting of the right costophrenic sinus might be caused by a small right pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
