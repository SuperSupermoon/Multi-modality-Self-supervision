Previously described increased opacity within the bilateral lung bases appear similar to prior and may be related to resolving pneumonia. No new confluent opacity is identified. There is no vascular congestion or overt interstitial edema. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is stable from prior, may reflect a small unchanged effusion. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly appears unchanged.
