AP chest compared to ___: Since ___, following extubation, lung volumes have decreased and greater opacification at the lung bases, particularly the right indicates worsening atelectasis. Left lower lobe atelectasis was severe prior to extubation, unchanged, though there is an increase in small left pleural effusion. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened in the lung apices, but I don't see pulmonary edema. Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
