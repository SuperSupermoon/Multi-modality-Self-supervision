A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Increased opacity bilaterally is consistent with mild pulmonary edema and increased vascular markings consistent with a high flow state. Increased opacity at the bases likely reflects small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or focal consolidation. Sclerosis of the humeral heads is consistent with avascular necrosis.
