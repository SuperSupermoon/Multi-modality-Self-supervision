ET tube tip is at the level of the carina and should be withdrawn 2-3 cm for more standard position. NG tube tip is in the stomach. There are two enteric tubes. There are low lung volumes. Cardiac size is top normal. Widened mediastinum largely due to projection and technique. There is plate-like atelectasis in the left base. Hazy opacity in the upper lobes bilaterally could be due to atelectasis, but infection cannot be totally excluded. Close followup is recommended. If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
