Widespread consolidation in the right lung appears relatively similar to the prior study, except for more well-defined rounded lucencies within the consolidation in the right upper and mid lung regions. This could reflect areas of underlying emphysema or development of necrotizing pneumonia. Predominantly interstitial opacities in the left lung likely represent interstitial edema. Right pleural effusion is unchanged.
