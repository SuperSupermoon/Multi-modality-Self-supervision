CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___, no definite change is detected. Equivocal minimal new linear atelectasis and pleural blunting at the right lung base. Again seen is background COPD, with moderate cardiomegaly and calcified aorta. There is upper zone redistribution, similar to prior, but no overt CHF. Also again seen is a small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. As before, the right hemidiaphragm is slightly eventrated. On the right, no focal opacity, consolidation or gross effusion.
