The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. The nasogastric tube extends into the stomach, distal tip not visualized. A right-sided PICC line extends into the low right atrium. Retraction by 7-8 cm would position its tip in the low SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Retrocardiac airspace opacification has decreased, likely due to resolved atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. Heart size is smaller, but magnified by the projection. A moderate hiatal hernia is unchanged.
