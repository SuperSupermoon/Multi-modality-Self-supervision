Given slightly low lung volumes, the lungs appear clear aside from minimal bibasilar atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Cardiac size is within normal limits. No large pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. No overt pulmonary edema. The right upper hemi thorax is not completely evaluated due to the overlying external line. A small triangular opacity appears to be overlying this line projecting above the fifth rib.
