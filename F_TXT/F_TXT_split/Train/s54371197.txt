The patient is intubated. A Swan-Ganz catheter is in correct position. Nasogastric tube follows expected course. Previously placed aortic balloon pump has been removed in the interval. The patient has a left and a right chest tube. The lung volumes are low, a pre-existing left upper lobe opacity is resolving. However, there are unchanged signs of mild fluid overload and relatively extensive retrocardiac atelectasis. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. No evidence of pneumothorax.
