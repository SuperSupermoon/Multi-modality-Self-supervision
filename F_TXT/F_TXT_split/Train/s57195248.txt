There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter, with its tip overlying the low SVC. There is no pneumothorax. The lungs are more fully inflated on the present radiograph, with decreased minimal bibasilar atelectasis. There is re-demonstration of central pulmonary vascular engorgement as well as increased conspicuity of a diffuse interstitial abnormality, likely reflecting worsening mild pulmonary edema. There are no pleural effusions. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. There is re-demonstration of deformity of the posterior right fourth rib, likely relating to remote trauma.
