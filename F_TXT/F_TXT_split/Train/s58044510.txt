Consolidation the right infrahilar region persists but is overall similar to the prior exam and could represent atelectasis, aspiration appropriate clinical setting cannot be excluded. Retrocardiac opacity is now increased from the prior exam with silhouetting of the lateral border the descending thoracic aorta, and is likely atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinum and hilar contours are overall unchanged. ETT is in standard position. Nasogastric tube in side-port traverses the diaphragm, of the side port may be at the gastroesophageal junction. The right internal jugular venous catheter ends in the low SVC, unchanged.
