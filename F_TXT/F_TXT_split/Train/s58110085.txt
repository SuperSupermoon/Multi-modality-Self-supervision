A single portable AP supine view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube projects 4.2 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular central venous catheter is present with the tip in the mid SVC. Nasogastric tube is subdiaphragmatic. There is diffuse opacification of bilateral lungs with a perihilar predominance but also extensively extending into the upper and lower lung zones. Scattered air bronchograms are also noted. Accounting for changes related to technique and positioning, heart is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contour is notable for venous engorgement and extensive aortic calcifications. Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
