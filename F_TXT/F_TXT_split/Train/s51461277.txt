The lungs are hyperexpanded, consistent with COPD. There is mild pulmonary edema. There is increased opacity at the bases bilaterally, which likely represents a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis. The aorta is tortuous, however the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is no pneumothorax. A healing posterior left fifth rib fracture is visualized, however no other fractures are visualized on today's examination.
