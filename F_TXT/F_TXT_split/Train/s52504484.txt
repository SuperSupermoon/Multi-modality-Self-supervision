As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right internal jugular vein device, in addition to the left pacemaker. The size of the cardiac silhouette is still substantially enlarged and the presence of a small pleural effusion on the left cannot be excluded. Otherwise, there are signs of minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema with no evidence of pneumonia. Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis.
