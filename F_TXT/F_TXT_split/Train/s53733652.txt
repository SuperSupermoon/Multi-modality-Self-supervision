Lung volumes are low. Heart size is accentuated as a result and appears mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, more so on the left. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified. Marked degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are seen.
