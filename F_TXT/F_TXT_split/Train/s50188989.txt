In comparison of the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there is interval improvement in the left basilar atelectasis. Lung volumes otherwise remain low bilaterally. On volumes exaggerate apparent pulmonary edema. There is at least unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion. A left-sided chest tube is present, with the side port that projects over the chest wall. A right-sided PICC terminates near the superior cavoatrial junction. An ET tube terminates 4.3 cm above the carina.
