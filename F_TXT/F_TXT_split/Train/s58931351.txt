Interval placement of a left-sided pigtail catheter is seen with tip projecting over the midline, presumably anteriorly. Persistent large left-sided pneumothorax is seen with some reexpansion of the left lung which is still largely collapsed. No definite mediastinal shift seen on the current exam noting some rotation of the patient to the right. Endotracheal tube tip is in close proximity to the carina. Enteric tube tip at the gastric fundus, side port likely in the distal esophagus. Significant subcutaneous gas projects over the left the chest wall laterally.
