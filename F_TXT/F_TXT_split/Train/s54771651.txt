There has been interval removal of the ET tube and NG tube. PICC line tip is in the distal SVC. There is bilateral lower lobe volume loss/infiltrate and bilateral pulmonary vascular redistribution with some patchy areas of alveolar infiltrate. There is a small left pleural effusion. Compared to the prior study, the pulmonary status appears slightly worse.
