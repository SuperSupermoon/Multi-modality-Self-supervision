Complete collapse of the right middle and lower lobes is redemonstrated. The aerated right upper lobe shows no focal opacities. No focal opacities are seen in the left lung. Coarse interstitial opacities in the left lower lobe is compatible with minimal fibrosis, unchanged from multiple priors. Small right-sided pleural effusion is also stable. There is no left-sided effusion. No pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted. Severe degenerative changes of both shoulders is present, with high riding humeral heads and obliteration of the acromiohumeral intervals bilaterally compatible with rotator cuff disease.
