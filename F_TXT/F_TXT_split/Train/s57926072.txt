CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Please note that this film is dated ___ and presented at 5:38 p.m. on ___ for official interpretation. An ET tube is present, 4.1 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film. There is cardiomegaly. There is increased retrocardiac density with air bronchograms and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
