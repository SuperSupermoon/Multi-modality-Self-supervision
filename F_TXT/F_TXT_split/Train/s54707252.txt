Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study. Platelike atelectasis of the left lung base is similar in appearance. No consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen. No free air seen under the diaphragm. Catheter tubing in the left lower abdomen is incompletely visualized but likely represents a gastrostomy tube.
