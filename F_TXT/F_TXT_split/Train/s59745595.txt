Single semi-erect frontal view of the chest demonstrates unchanged tracheostomy and a right PICC in standard position. The heart remains prominent. Perihilar vascular engorgement and moderate pulmonary edema is little changed. There is persistent bilateral small pleural effusion associated with atelectasis. Calcified pleural plaques are seen in the basal pleura bilaterally.
