Frontal upright view of the chest was obtained. A left midline catheter, previously positioned within the left subclavian vein, now terminates at the junction of the left axillary and subclavian veins. Allowing for positional differences, there has been no interval change in multifocal basilar-predominant consolidations. Multiple superimposed bilateral ill-defined nodular opacities are similar to prior and may be related to known vasculitis. Small right and moderate left pleural effusions are unchanged. The heart size is normal. No pneumothorax.
