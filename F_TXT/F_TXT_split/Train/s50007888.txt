Lungs fully expanded and clear. Heart size top-normal. Normal mediastinal and hilar contours and pleural surfaces. No displaced rib fracture is seen. Although no fracture is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sensitive for detection of chest cage trauma. Regions where there are focal findings of possible trauma should be clearly marked and imaged with bone detail views.
