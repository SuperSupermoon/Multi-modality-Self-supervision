Lung volumes are extremely low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vasculature, though even given technique there appears to be at least moderate cardiomegaly with central pulmonary vascular congestion as well as mild interstitial edema. There is likely a trace right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent bibasilar atelectasis. Concurrent infection cannot be excluded given the correct clinical circumstance. There is no pneumothorax.
