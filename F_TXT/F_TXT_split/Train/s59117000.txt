AP portable supine view of the chest. An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located 1.9 cm above the carinal. An orogastric tube extends into the left upper abdomen. There is retrocardiac opacity which could represent atelectasis versus pneumonia/ aspiration. There is a small left pleural effusion suspected. No supine evidence for pneumothorax. Mild right basal atelectasis noted. Bony structures appear demineralized though grossly intact.
