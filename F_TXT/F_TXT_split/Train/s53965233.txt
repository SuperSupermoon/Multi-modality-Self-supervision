Again seen is a large left upper lobe mass abutting the mediastinal border measuring approximately 7.5 cm in the CC direction, perhaps slightly increased since the prior studies. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The right lung is predominantly clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. There is stable elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Multiple old healed rib fractures are again noted.
