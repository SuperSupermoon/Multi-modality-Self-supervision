As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone right thoracocentesis. The effusion on the right has substantially decreased in extent but is still visible at the lung bases. On the left, pre-existing small-to-moderate pleural effusion has slightly increased in extent. At both lung bases there are areas of atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly that is unchanged. The previously malpositioned right PICC line has been re-positioned. The tip projects over the lower SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
