Following removal of right pigtail pleural catheter, a large right pleural effusion has increased in size, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Atelectasis is present within the right mid and lower lung adjacent to the large right pleural effusion. Additionally, a new patchy and linear atelectasis has developed at the left lung base as well as a possible small left pleural effusion.
