Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube. Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema. Developing opacities in both lower lobes probably represent atelectasis, but aspiration is an additional consideration particularly given proximal location of nasogastric tube on prior chest x-ray. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also present, similar on the right but increased on the left.
