As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated, and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The lung volumes have minimally decreased. The right lung base is now clear. On the left, a remnant atelectatic opacity with a mild pleural effusion is seen in almost unchanged manner. The diameter of the vascular structures suggests mild fluid overload. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of interval appearance of pneumonia.
