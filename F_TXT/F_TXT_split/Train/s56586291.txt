A single portable frontal upright view of the chest is provided. Left-sided AICD is stable in position. The cardiac silhouette is moderately to markedly enlarged, appears increased in size as compared to the prior study given differences in technique. he mediastinal contours are relatively stable. In comparison to the prior radiograph, there is increased perihilar opacification with cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Vascular markings also accentuated by low lung volumes. Small bilateral pleural effusions are given haziness of the diaphragms. There is no pneumothorax. Sternotomy wires and numerous surgical clips are again noted.
