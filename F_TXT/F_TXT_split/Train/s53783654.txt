The patient is somewhat rotated on today's study which limits assessment. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are grossly unchanged in position. The left-sided internal jugular catheter appears to terminate in the left brachiocephalic vein. Previous median sternotomy noted with unchanged appearances of the sutures. There is a hazy opacity at the right lung base consistent with a layering effusion. Small left pleural effusion also seen. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, unchanged compared to the prior study. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. An apparent superior mediastinal mass is likely an artifact as this is related to tubing overlying the patient attention on followup recommended.
