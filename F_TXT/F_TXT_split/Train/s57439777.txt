In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. Areas of increased opacification are again seen bilaterally, with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm. The findings are consistent with layering pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases. The possibility of supervening pneumonia would be supported by the imaging findings. There probably is still mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
