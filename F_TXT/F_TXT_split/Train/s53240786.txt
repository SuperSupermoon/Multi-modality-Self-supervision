Lung volumes are similar in appearance when compared to the prior study. The trachea is central. Mild splaying of the carina likely reflects left atrial enlargement. Increasing bibasilar opacities likely reflect a atelectasis however superimposed infection cannot be excluded. No definite pleural effusion seen. No pneumothorax seen.
