There is a tiny left hydro pneumothorax as evidenced by the air-fluid level on the right and subtle lateral pneumothorax visualized in the superior upper lung. There are small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left. There is mild pulmonary vascular redistribution. There is volume loss/infiltrate in both lower lungs.
