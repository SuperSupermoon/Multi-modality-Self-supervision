1. Endotracheal tube with its tip at thoracic inlet. Nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm, with the tip and side port likely within the proximal stomach, unchanged. A left subclavian central line with its tip in the proximal SVC. Bilateral layering effusions with persistent retrocardiac consolidation likely reflecting partial lower lobe collapse, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. The pulmonary vasculature remains somewhat prominent but no definite pulmonary edema is appreciated. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
