Since the recent chest radiograph from earlier today, a left pleural catheter has been removed. Left lung apex is partially obscured by external devices. With this limitation in mind, a small left apical pneumothorax is not appreciably changed. Exam is otherwise similar to the recent study except for removal of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.
