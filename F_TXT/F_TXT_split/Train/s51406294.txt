Lung volumes remain somewhat diminished. Overall, when compared to multiple previous studies dating back to ___, there does appear to be increasing interstitial prominence and fullness in the perihilar vessels suggesting an element of mild interstitial edema. Streaky opacities at both bases are again noted, likely reflecting bibasilar atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No large pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen, although the patient's mandible obscures part of the apices. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to patient rotation on the current study, although the heart likely remains stably enlarged.
