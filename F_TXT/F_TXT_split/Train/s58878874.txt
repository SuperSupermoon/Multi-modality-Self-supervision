As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of bilateral parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms, likely reflecting pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Pre-existing signs of mild pulmonary edema have decreased but fluid overload is still present. No larger pleural effusions.
