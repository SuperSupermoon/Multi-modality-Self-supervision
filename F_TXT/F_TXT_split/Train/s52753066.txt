Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter similar in configuration. Cardiomegaly is also grossly unchanged. Please note that pericardial fluid would be difficult to exclude on this study. Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm suggestive of a small left effusion. This is similar to the film from 1 day earlier, but degree of increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of left hemidiaphragm has increased. Also again seen is a right pleural effusion, now somewhat larger -- moderate in size -- and extending into the minor fissure, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Mild upper zone redistribution is not significantly changed.
