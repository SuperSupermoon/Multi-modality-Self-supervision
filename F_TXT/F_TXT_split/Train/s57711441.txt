Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged including cardiomegaly and distended azygos vein. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal consolidations are unchanged. Slight interval improvement in the right mid lung opacity is noted as well as in the left mid lung opacity and might be consistent with minimal interval improvement of pulmonary edema residual, although alternatively improving infectious process would be a possibility. No pneumothorax is seen.
