Endotracheal tube tip projects over the low trachea approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. An esophageal catheter traverses below the diaphragm with tip projecting over the left upper quadrant, likely within the stomach. There is a small left pleural effusion. Patchy opacity at right cardiophrenic angle and vertical stranding at left base medially most likely represents atelectasis or scarring. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is detected on this single view. Heart size is top normal. Aortic tortuosity is seen with otherwise normal mediastinal contours.
