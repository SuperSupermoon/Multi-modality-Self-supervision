As compared to the previous image, the patient is now intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 6 cm above the carina. The device could be advanced by 1-2 cm. A nasogastric tube shows a normal course, the tip projects over the proximal parts of the stomach. A pre-existing right central venous access line is constant. Unchanged low lung volumes and left pleural effusion with subsequent areas of atelectasis. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
