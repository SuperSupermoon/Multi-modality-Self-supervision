Severe dextroscoliosis is present. There is no definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Given scoliotic deformity, the heart size is difficult to assess although it appears within normal limits. Mediastinal and hilar contours appear normal. Mild blunting of costophrenic angles is again seen and is unchanged from prior examination.
