Lung volumes are low, causing accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature and exaggeration of the heart size. The lungs are grossly clear aside from minimal bibasilar atelectasis. Heart size is top normal. Note is made of a small hiatal hernia. The mediastinal contours are otherwise normal. There are no definite pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.
