1. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged. There are stable bibasilar patchy opacities with associated layering fluid suggestive of compressive atelectasis; however, the pulmonary vasculature is less well defined, consistent with worsening mild pulmonary edema. Heart is stably enlarged. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
