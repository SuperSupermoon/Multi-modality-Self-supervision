An endotracheal tube ends 5.3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube follows the expected course, although the tip is not visualized. Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis and right lower lung opacity representing partial right lower lobe collapse are new. The upper lung fields are clear. No pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
