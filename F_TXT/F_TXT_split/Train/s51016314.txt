Single portable view of the chest. Left chest wall port again seen with catheter tip at the RA/SVC junction. Lower lung volumes on the current exam. There is new right basilar opacity which is likely in part due to an effusion, although underlying infection is also possible. Left base opacity on prior has somewhat improved with some opacity in the retrocardiac region medially and probable small left effusion. Superiorly, the lungs are clear of consolidation. Enlarged hila, particularly on the right is better seen on the prior exam. Cardiomediastinal silhouette has not definitively changed. Atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic arch. Surgical clips identified in the left upper quadrant. Incidental note is made of an azygos lobe.
