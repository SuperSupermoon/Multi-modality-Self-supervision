Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiac size is top normal. Postoperative mediastinal widening is stable. Bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis, larger on the left side, are grossly unchanged when compared to prior study. If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no evident pneumothorax. Sternal wires are aligned.
