Extensive consolidation has worsened in the right lung. I doubt that this is asymmetric pulmonary edema, more likely pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. Chronic moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette could be due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion but is unchanged, since at least ___. Small right pleural effusion is likely, probably secondary to the pulmonary abnormality.
