There is stable position of left chest pacer device with associated dual leads projecting over the right atrium and right ventricle. There is sepsis stable position of right-sided PICC line with distal tip again not well visualized, projecting over the approximate mid to lower SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged in appearance. The bilateral hila are not well visualized. There are worsening right greater than left alveolar consolidations, likely signifying worsening asymmetric pulmonary edema ; in particular, the left lung field appears improved with evidence of decreasing pulmonary edema, while the right airspace opacities are worsened in comparison multiple prior radiographs. Given this appearance and asymmetric nature of progression with continued improvement of the left lung and continued worsening of the right, there is also concern for superimposed multifocal pneumonia. There are probably unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
