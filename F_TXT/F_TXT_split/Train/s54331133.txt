1. Right subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not definitely identified. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient rotation. There is improving aeration in the retrocardiac region suggestive of resolving atelectasis, although resolving pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Interval extubation with slight reduction in lung volumes. Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema on the current study. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-supine technique.
