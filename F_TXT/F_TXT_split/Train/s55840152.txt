There has been interval placement of a right-sided internal jugular venous catheter. The tip is slightly obscured by overlapping lead from pacemaker; however, appears to terminate in the low SVC. A single-lead left-sided pacemaker is unchanged.Within the lungs, no focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen. No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax is present. There is mild vascular congestion. The heart size is top normal, unchanged. Chain suture is noted in the left hemithorax with volume loss suggestive of prior resection.
