Compared to the prior film, the degree of opacification in left mid and lower zones has progressed, with new obscuration left hemidiaphragm. The appearance is suggestive of a left pleural effusion, probably loculated, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Allowing for obscuration of the left heart border, prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable and the mediastinum remains midline. Possible minimal prominence of the right pulmonary artery is unchanged. There is mild upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. The right lung is grossly clear, except were minimal atelectasis or scarring at the right lung base. No gross right effusion.
