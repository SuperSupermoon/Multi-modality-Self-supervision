As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The nasogastric tube has been removed. There is unchanged evidence of colonic parts interposed between the diaphragm and the chest wall. Unchanged elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with high outstanding gastric bubble. Unchanged atelectasis in the perihilar right lung areas and in the retrocardiac lung area. The shape of this opacity does not suggest pneumonia. No other changes. Constant alignment of the sternal wires.
