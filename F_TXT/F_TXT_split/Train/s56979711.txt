Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of bronchovascular markings. Minimal pulmonary vascular engorgement cannot be excluded. Cardiac silhouette appears prominent but may be accentuated by low lung volumes. No focal consolidation is identified. Rounded opacification within the right lung adjacent to the trachea is noted which likely represents prominant azygous. No clear evidence of acute rib fractures. Old left rib deformities. If there is continued clinical concern for rib fracture, then dedicated rib series can be obtained.
