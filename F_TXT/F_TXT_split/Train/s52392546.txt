A left-sided dialysis catheter terminates in the upper atrium. The patient is status post sternotomy. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is similar moderate relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with patchy basilar opacification suggesting minor atelectasis. Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A small pleural effusion would be difficult to appreciate on the left side, however, if one were present.
