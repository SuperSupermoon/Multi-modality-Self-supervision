Note is again made of a round, well-circumscribed density in the left mediastinum filling the aortopulmonary window, which corresponds to the patient's known pseudoaneurysm. The pseudoaneurysm measures approximately 5.5 x 4.3 cm on today's examination compared to 4.2 x 3.4 cm when measured in a similar plane on coronal imaging. The mediastinum is not indistinct in comparison to the prior CT. The trachea remains focally deviated to the right. A small meniscus in the left lung base corresponds to epicardial fat on the prior CT. No significant pleural effusion is present. Indistinct nodular opacities projected over the right upper lung zone, which may be vascular. A bulla is present in the left lung apex on the prior CT. The cardiac silhouette is moderately to severely enlarged but unchanged.
