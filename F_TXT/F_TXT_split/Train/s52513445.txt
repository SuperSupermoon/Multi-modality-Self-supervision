Slight displacement of the trachea is similar to prior and likely due to low lung volumes. The tip of the ETT may abut the tracheal wall. Stable cardiomegaly and unchanged configuration of aortic knob calcification. Left pleural effusion is redistributed or slightly smaller as compared to the prior exam. The right pleural effusion has slightly increased. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and bibasilar atelectasis are stable.
