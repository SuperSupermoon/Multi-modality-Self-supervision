The left hemithorax is completely opacified with ipsilateral shift towards the left, consistent with complete left lung collapse. This is similar in appearance to the radiograph of one day earlier but is a new finding compared to earlier studies. Abrupt cutoff of the left main bronchus suggest mucous plugging as the cause of this finding. Right lung is slightly overexpanded. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size and is accompanied by improving atelectasis at the right lung base. Known left effusion cannot be accurately assessed in the setting of complete left lung collapse. Minimal interstitial edema and pulmonary vascular congestion are unchanged. Dr. ___ was telephoned with these findings on ___ at 9:40 a.m. at the time of discovery.
