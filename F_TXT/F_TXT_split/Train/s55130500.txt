1. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable overall cardiac and mediastinal contours given marked patient rotation on the current examination. Tracheostomy tube continues to have its tip 5 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC and a left-sided pacer has its tip projecting over the expected location of the right atrium. Lungs grossly clear. There is a persistent patchy opacity at the left base, but overall improved since ___ at 3:36 a.m., suggesting resolving atelectasis. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated, of uncertain significance. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema.
