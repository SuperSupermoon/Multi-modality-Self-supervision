CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Slightly rotated positioning. An ET tube is present -- tip lies approximately 5.5 cm above the carina, though not optimally visualized due to positioning. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is present, overlying the right pulmonary artery, relatively distal -- clinical correlation regarding retraction is requested. A left IJ central line is present -- the tip lies at the proximal SVC near the site of confluence with the right subclavian vein. No pneumothorax is detected. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted. The findings in the lungs are unchanged compard with 1 day prior. Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.
