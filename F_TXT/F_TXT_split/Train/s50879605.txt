Single portable view of the chest. There are multiple skin-folds projecting over the right hemithorax in a different configuration compared to prior. Of note, lung markings are not seen at the periphery on the right nor on the left, which is likely due to technique and patient as opposed to confirmatory evidence of a pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
