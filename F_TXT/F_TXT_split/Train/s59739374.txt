AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiographs, ___: ET tube, intra-aortic balloon pump, ascending Swan-Ganz catheter, and a nasogastric drainage tube are in standard placements respectively. Heart is top normal size. Left lung is grossly clear. Large region of opacification in the right mid chest could be asymmetric edema or if the patient received vigorous resuscitation pulmonary contusion, alternatively moderate right pleural effusion collected posteriorly in this supine patient. Upright radiographs recommended when feasible. I do not see pneumothorax or displaced rib fractures.
