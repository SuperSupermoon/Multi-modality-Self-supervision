Rotated positioning. A tube is seen immediately to the left of midline at the level of the trachea. However, given patient rotation, it is difficult to confirm that this represents an ET tube. The tip lies at the inferior edge of the clavicular heads. Clinical correlation is requested. An NG tube is present, extending beneath diaphragm, off the film. Right IJ central line tip overlies the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably similar. Again seen is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular plethora. Hazy opacity at the lung bases suggests the presence of bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Allowing for differences in positioning, the left pleural effusion appears smaller. Otherwise, the appearance at both bases is probably similar.
