Single portable frontal upright chest radiograph is obtained. Tracheostomy tube projects approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. Right-sided Port-A-Cath is in the lower SVC. Heart is mildly enlarged, but the cardiomediastinal contour is otherwise unremarkable. Linear basilar opacities likely represent atelectasis. Lungs are clear. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Bony structures are grossly intact.
