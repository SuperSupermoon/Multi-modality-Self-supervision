An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating at the level of the thoracic inlet approximately 4 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen with the tip terminating above the level of the diaphragm, which should be advanced for proper positioning. A right internal jugular central venous line is in place with the tip terminating in the upper to mid SVC. The patient is status post median sternotomy with intact wires and multiple mediastinal surgical clips compatible with prior CABG. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. The mediastinal contours are slightly prominent, which is related in part to AP technique. No focal airspace opacity, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present.
