A right PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged from prior fluoroscopic images from ___. A pacemaker generator overlies the left chest wall. The leads appear intact and terminate in the region of the right atrium and right ventricle. The atrial lead appears to terminate more medially than expected, suggesting that it might not be fixed in position within the atrium. Lung volumes are lower, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. No confluent opacity is identified. There is no pulmonary edema or large pleural effusion, though a trace right effusion is likely. No pneumothorax is visualized. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
