AP chest compared to ___ and ___. Moderate cardiomegaly is larger accompanied by upper lobe pulmonary vascular engorgement, but no edema or substantial pleural effusion. Mitral annulus is very heavily calcified, which predisposes the patient to mitral regurgitation. No pneumothorax and pleural effusion, if present, is minimal. I see no findings to suggest pneumonia or even recent aspiration.
