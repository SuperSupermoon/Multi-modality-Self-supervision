The new right PICC line terminates within the mid SVC. A left-sided PICC line projects in unchanged location, also terminating within the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Allowing for differences in lung volumes, small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Linear atelectasis or a small amount of fluid extending into the fissure is slightly more prominent at the left base than on the prior study, suggesting an increase in left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation or pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Sternotomy wires are unchanged.
