As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is now in semi-erect position. There is a progression of the left basal parenchymal opacity that is now substantially more extensive and severe. In addition, there is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small left pleural effusion. The lung volumes are low. Moderate cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
