Compared to the most recent prior, there are new diffuse parenchymal opacities, septal thickening, and enlargement and indistinctness of the hila, findings compatible with superimposed severe acute pulmonary edema. Consolidation within the right base secondary to probable pneumonia appears denser due to overlying edema. There are increasing bilateral effusions. Probable left basilar atelectasis is similar. There is no pneumothorax.
