Increased opacification asymmetrically in the left lung is likely pulmonary edema given vascular engorgement and septal lines. Left greater than right basal opacities suggest atelectasis. Bilateral dependent pleural effusions are unchanged. Right PICC terminates likely at the superior cavoatrial junction. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly persists.
