Left lung is still nearly entirely collapsed, producing severe ipsilateral mediastinal shift preventing assessment of heart size. Volume of any left pleural effusion is indeterminate. Right lung is clear. No right pleural effusion or pneumothorax. FINDINGS, including impaction of the left bronchial tree on recent chest CT, discussed with intensive clinical care team.
