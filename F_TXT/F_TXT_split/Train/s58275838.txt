Single portable view of the chest. Prior right PICC is no longer visualized. Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam. Retrocardiac opacity on the left could be due to a subpulmonic effusion or potentially atelectasis/infection. Linear right basilar opacity suggestive of atelectasis versus scarring. Superiorly, the lungs are clear of consolidation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess given overlying density at the left lung base.
