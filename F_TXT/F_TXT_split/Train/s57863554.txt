Patient has been extubated. There is interval placement of Dobbhoff tube coiled in the stomach with tip pointing cephalad. Again seen is a left subclavian venous catheter with tip in the left brachiocephalic vein, near the junction with the superior vena cava, pointing towards the wall of the SVC. The left pleural effusion has increased in size, now moderate. A left retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis, is present. There is a new small right pleural effusion.
