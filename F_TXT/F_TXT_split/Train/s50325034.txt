In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies low in the trachea and should be pulled back about 3 cm. Nasogastric tube extends at least to the upper stomach, were crosses the lower margin of the image. Swan-Ganz catheter has its tip in the pulmonary outflow tract. Little change in the diffuse opacification of the left hemithorax consistent with substantial layering effusion and compressive basilar atelectasis. Scattered areas of opacification on the right could reflect an alveolar process, with pulmonary vascular congestion probably complicating the appearance on both sides.
