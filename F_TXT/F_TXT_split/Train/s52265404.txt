The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged with moderately severe cardiomegaly. A left-sided PICC terminates at the origin of the SVC. The tip of the nasogastric tube is not visualized but lies below the left hemidiaphragm. There is new left lower lobe atelectasis with associated volume loss. The bilateral hila appear prominent consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion but no frank pulmonary edema seen.
