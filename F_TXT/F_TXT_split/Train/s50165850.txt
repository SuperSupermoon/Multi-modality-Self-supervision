Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. There is interval insertion of the right central venous line terminating in the right atrium, most likely reflecting the hemodialysis catheter. The left central venous line tip terminates at the level of mid SVC. The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm, most likely terminating at least in the duodenum. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged and there is mild interstitial pulmonary edema with bibasal atelectasis. No focal consolidations to suggest infectious process are currently seen.
