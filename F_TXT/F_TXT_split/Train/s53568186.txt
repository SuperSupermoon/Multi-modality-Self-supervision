The patient is intubated, an endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the level the carina. This is essentially unchanged in position compared to the prior chest radiograph. A nasogastric tube is in-situ, the tip is not visualized but lies below the left hemidiaphragm. There has been interval improvement in the left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. No consolidation or pneumothorax seen.
