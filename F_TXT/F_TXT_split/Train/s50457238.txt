In comparison with study of ___, there are slightly lower lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is no convincing vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. Some retrocardiac opacification is consistent with atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. The tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 2.2 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach and the right IJ catheter tip is probably in the upper portion of the right atrium, though it could be in the region of the cavoatrial junction. Of incidental note are scattered calcified granulomas bilaterally.
