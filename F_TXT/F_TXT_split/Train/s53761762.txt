Portable semi-upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates improved lung volumes. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is normal in appearance. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is marked calcification of the aortic knob. Median sternotomy wires and surgical clips superimposed upon the mediastinum are unchanged. A left axillary pacemaker is again noted, with atrial and ventricular leads taking a contiguous and expected course.
