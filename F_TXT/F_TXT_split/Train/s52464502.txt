Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent large right-sided pleural effusion with collapse of the right lower lobe and shift of the mediastinum to the right. Again seen are stable appearing diffuse increased interstitial opacities consistent with mild pulmonary edema or lymphangitic spread of lung cancer. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion. Multiple nodules are seen in the left lung, but were better evaluated on recent PET-CT. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Right VP shunt catheter is seen coursing along the right chest, and into the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. There is no pneumothorax.
