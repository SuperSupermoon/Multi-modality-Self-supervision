There has been placement of an OG tube which is coiled within the stomach. ET tube is in appropriate positioning. Since the prior radiograph, there has been no significant change. Again seen is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with volume loss in the left upper and left lower lobes. There is leftward mediastinal shift, consistent with volume loss. There is no pneumothorax. Right IJ central line is in appropriate position within the right atrium.
