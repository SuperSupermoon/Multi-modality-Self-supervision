Allowing for lower lung volumes on the current study, cardiomediastinal contours are stable compared to ___ radiograph. Lungs are remarkable for a new patchy opacity partially obscuring P medial left hemidiaphragm. In the recent postoperative setting, this could reflect localized atelectasis, aspiration, and less likely an early focus of pneumonia. Lungs are otherwise clear except minimal linear bibasilar atelectasis peripherally.
