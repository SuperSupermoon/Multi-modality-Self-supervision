There is again seen evidence of previous endovascular repair of AAA. The cardio mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. The bilateral hila are not well visualized. There are again seen low lung volumes and widespread increased interstitial opacities consistent with known pulmonary fibrosis. Grossly, there is no interval change in appearance of lungs in comparison to prior radiograph, although evaluation for secondary processes such as superimposed infection is limited given the extent of fibrosis. There is poor visualization of the right lateral CP angle which may signify a small right pleural effusion, although this is difficult to evaluate given extensive fibrosis. There are no pneumothoraces.
