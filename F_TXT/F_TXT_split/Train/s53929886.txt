AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. No preceding chest examination is available for comparison. A right subclavian approach line is seen apparently related to a most recent Port-A-Cath system placement. The line terminates at the level 6 cm below the carina, and related to the demonstrated external cardiac contours, it may have reached the upper portion of the right atrium. The heart does not appear enlarged, and no configurational abnormality is identified. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion, and no pleural effusions that are blunting the lateral pleural sinuses. No pneumothorax in the apical area. Surgical clips in the mid portion of the upper abdomen, indicative of previous surgery, type unknown.
