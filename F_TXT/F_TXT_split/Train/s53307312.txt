1. Left subclavian line and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning. There is likely an increasing right pleural effusion. Overall, the focal airspace consolidation in the right lower lobe is not significantly changed. Other patchy opacities in the right upper lobe and in the left lower lobe are also stable. Findings would be more consistent with an infectious process such as multifocal pneumonia. There continues to be mild vascular congestion, but no pulmonary edema is evident. No pneumothorax.
