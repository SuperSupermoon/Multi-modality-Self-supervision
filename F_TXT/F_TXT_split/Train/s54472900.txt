Rotated positioning. Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip lies near the cavoatrial junction. 2 separate tubes overlie the right lung base, similar to prior. The possibility of a small residual right apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded. The prior study raise the possibility that there was fluid associated with the pleural space in this area. Subcutaneous emphysema in the right supraclavicular fossae, extending into the right lower neck, is similar to the prior film. There is cardiomegaly, similar to prior. The previous right cardiophrenic opacity has improved. A small right pleural effusion is now visible. Ppacity Retrocardiac opacity is again seen, slightly more pronounced. Doubt CHF.
