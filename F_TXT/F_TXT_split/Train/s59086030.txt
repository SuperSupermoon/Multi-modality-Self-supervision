The NG tube is in the stomach with the proximal port just below the gastroesophageal junction. The right-sided PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. The ET tube is no longer visualized. There is patchy areas of alveolar infiltrate seen in the right upper lobe and both lower lobes. It is unclear if these are due to atelectasis versus early infiltrates.
