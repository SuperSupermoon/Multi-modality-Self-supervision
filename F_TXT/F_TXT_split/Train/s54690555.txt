Lordotic positioning .there is moderately severe cardiomegaly. Relative prominence of the superior mediastinum is likely accentuated by a lordotic positioning. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with obscuration of left hemidiaphragm and faint air bronchograms. Equivocal minimal left pleural effusion. Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, consistent with CHF. Hazy density at the right base could represent a combination of atelectasis and overlying soft tissues. Attention to this area on followup films is requested. A small right effusion would be difficult to exclude. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
