There has been interval placement of a right chest tube, which terminates along the right lung base. Associated subcutaneous emphysema is noted. There is still a moderate right pneumothorax without evidence of tension pneumothorax. Right-sided rib fractures are better delineated on the recent rib series. The left lung is grossly clear, and the heart is normal in size.
