Following insertion of bilateral pigtail pleural drainage catheters, which drained substantial volumes of pleural fluid, the lungs look substantially more clear, a phenomenon frequently observed where the presence of pleural effusions makes the lungs radiographically worse than actually are. There is still substantial bibasilar atelectasis. I think the left lower lobe is still collapsed. Heart is normal size. ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placements. There is no pneumothorax. Right PIC line is repositioned, previously in the low SVC, now ending at the level of the sternal notch it is probably in a small vein.
