There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device, which appears unchanged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Calcified pleural plaques along the left mid to upper left hemithorax appear similar. The degree of pleural thickening and a possible small effusion of the left appear unchanged since the more recent of the two prior radiographs. A left basilar opacity has continued to improve, however.
