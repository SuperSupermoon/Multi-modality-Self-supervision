As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. However, signs of mild fluid overload, bilateral small pleural effusions and basal areas of atelectasis are constant.
