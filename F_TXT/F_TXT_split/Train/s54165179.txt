Since prior, there has been development of a now moderate sized right apical pneumothorax. A right basilar pigtail catheter is unchanged in position. A left PICC ends in the mid SVC. Dobhoff ends in the proximal stomach just below the gastroesophageal junction. A moderate left pleural effusion is not significantly changed. Mild pulmonary edema persists.
