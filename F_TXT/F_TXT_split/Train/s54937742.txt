Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Central venous line tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance including cardiomegaly and prominence of the azygos vein. Minimal interstitial opacities are noted in the lower lobes, but no substantial change since the prior study is seen and no definitive consolidation is noted, although radiographically occult consolidation within the lungs is a possibility, and if clinically warranted, correlation with cross-sectional imaging (chest CT) might be considered.
