The patient is status post sternotomy and probably coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The lowermost sternal wire again shows dishiscences which are unchanged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. A vague opacity obscuring the lingula is not very striking. The lung volumes are low, probably explaining crowding of lung markings at the lung bases. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
