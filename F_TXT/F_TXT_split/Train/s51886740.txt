Bilateral pleural effusions are present although most likely not substantially being. In the absence of prior studies for comparison2 specific diagnosis is difficulty made. Correlation with prior imaging or if not available with chest CT might be considered if clinically indicated Infectious process contributing to the right hilar appearance is another possibility, please correlate with clinical findings
