In comparison to the most recent radiograph, there is no significant interval change in the degree of right lower lobe collapse and moderate right pleural effusion. Extensive bilateral airspace opacities are minimally improved on the left, and again may be due to severe pulmonary edema, hemorrhage or multifocal pneumonia. Moderate left pleural effusion with associated partial left lower lobe collapse is also unchanged.
