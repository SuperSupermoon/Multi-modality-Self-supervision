The heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Persistent crescentic focal opacity is noted within the left lower lobe, which could reflect an area of infection or atelectasis. Minimal streaky opacities elsewhere in both lung bases are compatible with areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Mild paraseptal emphysematous changes are noted in the lung apices. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
