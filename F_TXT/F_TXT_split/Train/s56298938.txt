In comparison with the study ___, the right IJ catheter is been removed. Endotracheal tube and left IJ sheath remain in good position. Nasogastric tube extends to the lower body of the stomach, where it coils back on itself so that the tip lies close to the esophagogastric junction and pointing upward. Retrocardiac opacification is again consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Blunting of the costophrenic angle could reflect a small pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette is stable and there is no appreciable pulmonary vascular congestion.
