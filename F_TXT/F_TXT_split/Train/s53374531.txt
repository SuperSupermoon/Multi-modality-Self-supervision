Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 3 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. Left base opacity may be a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded. In the interval since the prior study, there has been increased prominence and indistinctness of the hila, consistent with evolving pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Left humeral head is not seen, although not dedicated imaging of the shoulder, query prior trauma/osteolysis.
