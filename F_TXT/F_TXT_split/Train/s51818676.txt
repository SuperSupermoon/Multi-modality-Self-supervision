A tracheostomy tube remains in place. There is new right-sided volume loss with apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which is likely secondary to lower lobe atelectasis. Superimposed bibasilar opacities are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits.
