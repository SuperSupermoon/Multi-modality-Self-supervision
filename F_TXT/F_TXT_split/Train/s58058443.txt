In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a left subclavian catheter that extends to the mid to lower portion of the SVC. No evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is seen. There is evidence of old healed fractures of multiple left ribs as well as the left mid clavicle and the right distal clavicle.
