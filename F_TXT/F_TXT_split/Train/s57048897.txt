Overlying trauma board slightly limits evaluation. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6.5 cm from the carina, and nasogastric tube tip courses through the stomach, off the inferior borders of the film. There are low lung volumes. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Apparent widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to supine technique and low lung volumes. Ill-defined opacities within the left upper and both lower lung fields may atelectasis. No large pneumothorax is seen. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. There is mild irregularity of the right seventh rib laterally, and fracture in this region is not excluded.
