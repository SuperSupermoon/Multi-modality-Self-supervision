The patient has been extubated and an orogastric tube removed. Mediastinal drains and a left thoracostomy tube have also been removed. A right IJ catheter terminates within the upper right atrium. Sternal wires and mediastinal clips denote recent CABG. There is no pneumothorax or focal consolidation. Bandlike linear opacities at the left lung base are most compatible with atelectasis. There is a trace left pleural effusion. Dilated loops of bowel may reflect ileus.
