Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Retrocardiac opacity with air-fluid levels consistent with a large hiatal hernia. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. There may be some biapical scarring. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
