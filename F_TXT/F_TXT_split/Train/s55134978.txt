AP portable view of the chest demonstrates left PIC catheter tip projecting over distal SVC. Linear opacities in the right lung base likely represent atelectasis. Small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. The left lung appears well aerated without pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is normal. There is no pulmonary edema.
