The lungs are hyperinflated. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Chain sutures are noted overlying the left mid hemithorax. The aorta is tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature which may be due to central pulmonary vascular engorgement or possibly component of pulmonary arterial hypertension. No displaced fracture is identified. The bilateral humeri are partially imaged, but are seen to be high-riding, which can be seen in rotator cuff disease.
