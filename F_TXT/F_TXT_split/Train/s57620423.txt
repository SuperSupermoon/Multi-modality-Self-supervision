The NG tube extends at least to the mid body of the stomach. The side hole is probably just below the esophagogastric junction. There is some suggested increased opacification at the bases. This could represent increased pulmonary venous pressure combined with atelectasis and possible pleural effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
