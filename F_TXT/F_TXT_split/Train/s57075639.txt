Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the side hole is above the esophagogastric junction. There is some patchy opacification at the left base. Although this could merely be atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, a developing pneumonia would have to be considered.
