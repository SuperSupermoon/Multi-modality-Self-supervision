A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrate the nasogastric tube extending at least into the stomach. Low lung volumes emphasize the cardiac silhouette, with the heart likely top normal in size. There is bibasilar linear atelectasis, right greater than left. There is no large pleural effusion, and no pneumothorax. A skin fold overlying the right upper lung should not be confused for a pneumothorax.
