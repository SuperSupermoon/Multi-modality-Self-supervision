1. The patient is once again rotated to her left and the images were acquired with lordotic technique, limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. Right lung is clear. The left upper lung is unremarkable. However, there is opacity once again seen at the left base, which is felt to likely reflect the cardiac shadow superimposed on the lung parenchyma. However, this does limit evaluation of this area. No pulmonary edema. Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints. No pneumothorax.
