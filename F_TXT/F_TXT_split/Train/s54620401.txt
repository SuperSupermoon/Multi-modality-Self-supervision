AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 6:49 p.m. There is little more air in the left pleural space, over which the left small bore drainage catheter projects. There is probably still substantial atelectasis and some loculated pleural fluid. Cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged, mediastinal veins are dilated and there may be very mild edema in the right lung. I can identify a vertically oriented tubing which projects to the left of the thoracic spine.
