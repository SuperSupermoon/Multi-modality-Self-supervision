Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube tip is below the gastroesophageal junction, though the side port is within the distal esophagus. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is accentuated due to low lung volumes and is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal contours are prominent due to supine positioning and low lung volumes. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is noted. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis or aspiration. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
