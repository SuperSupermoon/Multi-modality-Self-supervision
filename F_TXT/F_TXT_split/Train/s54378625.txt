In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. The enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has decreased and the pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits or slightly increased. Opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable small effusion. Otherwise little change.
