Lung volumes are markedly low on this portable semi upright chest radiograph. Left chest wall implanted device is again noted with catheter extending towards the left neck soft tissues. Allowing for low lung volumes, there is no convincing evidence for pneumonia or edema. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged. Bony structures are intact. The feeding tube projects over the mid abdomen.
