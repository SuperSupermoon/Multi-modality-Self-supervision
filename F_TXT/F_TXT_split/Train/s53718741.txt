Compared with the immediate prior radiograph, the right subclavian line, endotracheal tube, and enteric tube have been removed. The new tracheostomy ends 3.4 cm from the carina. New increased density at the right base may be due to atelectasis, however infectious pneumonia or acute aspiration cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
