In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends into the stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the image. The left base is clearer than on the previous study, with some residual opacification that could represent volume loss and effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in this region. The right lung is clear and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
