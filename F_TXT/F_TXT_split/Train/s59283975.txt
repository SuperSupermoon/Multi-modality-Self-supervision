As compared to the previous radiograph, the known right pneumothorax has minimally decreased in extent but is still clearly visible. The pigtail catheter in the right pleural space is unchanged. On the left, there is a new subtle parenchymal opacity representing atelectasis. The appearance of the cardiac silhouette is constant. No new parenchymal opacities are otherwise noted.
