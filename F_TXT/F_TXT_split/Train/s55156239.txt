AP chest compared to ___: Heart is smaller and mediastinal veins are no longer distended. Some edema in the right lower lobe has improved and there is no appreciable right pleural effusion, on the left there is still an extensive region of infrahilar consolidation. It should be followed to make sure it is slowly clearing asymmetric edema rather than something focal in the left lower lobe, likely pneumonia or even pulmonary hemorrhage. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion is small on the left if any. Tip of the right internal jugular line ends nearly 6 cm below the level of the carina and would need to be withdrawn 2 cm to reposition it in the low SVC.
