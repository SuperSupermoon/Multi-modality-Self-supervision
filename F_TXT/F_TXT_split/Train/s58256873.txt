As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing parenchymal opacity at the right lung base has completely cleared. Also, the left lung bases clear than on the previous examination. A minimal lateral zone of increased lung density, likely reflecting atelectasis, however, persists. No pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema. No cardiomegaly.
