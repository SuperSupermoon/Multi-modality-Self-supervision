Interval removal of the right internal jugular introducer, nasogastric tube, and endotracheal tube. Dual lead left-sided pacer remains in place. The heart remains markedly enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Lung volumes remain low with layering effusions and bibasilar patchy opacities which could reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered. Crowding of the vasculature but no pulmonary edema is evident on the current study. No pneumothorax.
