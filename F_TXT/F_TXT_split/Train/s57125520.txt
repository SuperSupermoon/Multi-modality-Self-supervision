A faint outline of an NG tube is seen in the midline extending towards the diaphragm. It appears to extend just below the diaphragm with the side hole likely near the gastroesophageal junction. The left PICC is in unchanged position with the tip in the mid SVC. The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
