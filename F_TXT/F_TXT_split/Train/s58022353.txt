As compared to the previous image, the patient has received a Dobbhoff catheter. The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip of the catheter projects over the distal parts of the stomach. No complications, notably no pneumothorax. The size of the cardiac silhouette and the lung bases appear unchanged.
