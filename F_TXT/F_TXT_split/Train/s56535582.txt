In comparison to prior radiograph from a few hr earlier, a right-sided chest tube has been placed, with decrease in size of right pneumothorax, now small to moderate. Right pleural effusion has decreased in size, and subcutaneous emphysema is new. Exam is otherwise remarkable for relatively low position of endotracheal tube, terminating 2.3 cm above the carina.
