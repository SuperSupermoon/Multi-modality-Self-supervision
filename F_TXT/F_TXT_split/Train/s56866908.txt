There has been placement of a left-sided central venous line with the distal lead tip in the distal SVC. Tracheostomy is unchanged. Lung findings are stable with bibasilar patchy opacities, some of which appear nodular. There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity and small bilateral effusions. No pneumothoraces are seen.
