Lung volumes are low. Streaky linear left basilar opacities extend to the hilum and likely represent atelectasis. The right lung demonstrates linear right basilar atelectasis and is otherwise grossly clear. There is no right pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged from the prior several examinations.
