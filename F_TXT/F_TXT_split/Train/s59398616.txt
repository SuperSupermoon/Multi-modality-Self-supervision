Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob noted. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Low lung volumes are noted. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may be due to the atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes though infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded. Small right pleural effusion is decreased in size compared to the previous study. No pneumothorax is identified.
