Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval worsening opacification of the right lung consistent with fluid overload and pulmonary edema. There may be some additional atelectasis of the right lung, although it is difficult to determine on this study. Repositioning of the chest tube may be helpful. The left lung is unchanged compared to the prior. Support devices remain in unchanged position with the exception of interval removal of an NG tube.
