Left pleural catheter is seen but appears to been repositioned. No pneumothorax is appreciated. There is persistent patchy opacity at the left base with an associated effusion which may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. Perihilar vascular congestion is again seen with improvement in the mild interstitial edema. 1.8 cm nodular opacity in the left upper lobe for which correlation to the outside chest CT would be recommended as the images from this study are not fully available on our PACs system. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
