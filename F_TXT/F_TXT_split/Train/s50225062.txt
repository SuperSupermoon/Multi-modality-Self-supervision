AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes still remain very low. Nevertheless, there is improved aeration in the right lower lobe, rendering the descending pulmonary artery and its branches newly visible. At least a small or moderate right pleural effusion persists. The left lung base shows more atelectasis medially. Supine positioning may be responsible for the apparent increase in mediastinal caliber and increasing heart size, but there is still a possibility of a contribution of increased mediastinal vascular engorgement and cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax, appreciable left pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. Displaced right rib fractures have been cited previously. ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placements respectively.
