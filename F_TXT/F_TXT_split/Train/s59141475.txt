Endotracheal tube appears in position with the tip in the mid trachea. An enteric tube traverses the stomach. Right-sided central venous catheter appears stable with the tip at the proximal right atrium. Again noted is a moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Consolidation is again noted in the right lower lobe and may reflect site of pulmonary infection. Additionally, left lung reticular opacities with septal thickening, better delineated on dedicated CT, are slightly improved and may represent edema with possible coexisting infection or hemorrhage. The right upper lung continues to be spared. Cardiac and medistinal contours are stable. There is no pneumothorax.
