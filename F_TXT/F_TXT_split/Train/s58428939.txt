The nasogastric tube tip is only in the upper stomach, with the side port above the esophagogastric junction. Right subclavian catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged and there is some tortuosity of the aorta. No definite vascular congestion or pleural effusion. There is mild asymmetry of opacification at the bases, more prominent on the left. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could possibly represent a developing focus of pneumonia.
