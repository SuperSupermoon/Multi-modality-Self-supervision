An endotracheal tube is in place, terminating 3.7 cm above the level the carina. Enteric tube courses through the esophagus, below the diaphragm, an out of view. The lung volumes are low, accentuating heart size, which is top-normal, and crowding of pulmonary vascular structures which may be mildly congested. No pneumothorax, overt pulmonary edema, or focal consolidation is seen. The left costophrenic sulcus is not visualized, possibly due to atelectasis and effusion.
