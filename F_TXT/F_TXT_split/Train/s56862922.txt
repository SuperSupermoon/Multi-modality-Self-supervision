A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs are hyperinflated. Interstitial markings are enhanced at both lung bases. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. There is linear scarring at the apices. There are no abnormal cardiac and mediastinal contours. A 3 cm dense lesion in the proximal left humeral metaphysis shows a peripheral pattern of ring and arc mineralization.
