Bilateral hazy opacities, in particular overlying the lower lobes, are noted, suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears enlarged. There are also small bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar opacities, which is more pronounced in the retrocardiac region, likely reflect compressive atelectasis. Post-surgical changes are noted in the left axilla. There is no pneumothorax. No acute fractures are identified.
