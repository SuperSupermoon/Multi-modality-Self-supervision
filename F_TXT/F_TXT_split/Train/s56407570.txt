As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the tracheostomy tube is unchanged. The lung volumes remain low. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting a small left pleural effusion, is new. There continues to be a subtle opacity at the right lung base, but its extent has decreased. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with signs of minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
