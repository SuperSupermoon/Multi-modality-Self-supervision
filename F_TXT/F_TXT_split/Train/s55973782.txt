In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little overall change. Again there are relatively low lung volumes which accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Bibasilar opacification is consistent with pleural effusion and atelectatic changes. Subcutaneous gas is again seen along the right lateral chest wall and in the right neck. No definite pulmonary edema.
