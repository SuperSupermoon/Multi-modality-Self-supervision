AP chest compared to ___, 6:05 p.m.: Large right pneumothorax has increased substantially in volume since 6:05 p.m. on ___, with greater eversion of the right hemidiaphragm and progressive leftward mediastinal shift, indicating that the right pigtail pleural catheter is not adequately draining the right pleural space. The radiographic findings make it imperative to consider possible tension pneumothorax and respond appropriately. Severe consolidation in both lungs is unchanged but would need to be assessed after evacuation of the pneumothorax. The heart is small, and mediastinal veins are diminutive, both findings consistent with though not diagnostic of tension pneumothorax. ET tube and right subclavian line are in standard placements and a nasogastric drainage tube ends in the stomach. I discussed these findings by telephone with Dr. ___ on the ___ care team at 9:20 this morning as soon as I saw them on the radiograph.
