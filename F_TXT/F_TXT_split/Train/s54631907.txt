There has been significant interval increase in right mid-to-lower lung opacity which may represent combination of worsening malignancy and underlying atelectasis/pleural fluid, although underlying infection may also be present. There are areas of lucency that project over the right lower lung opacity which may represent aerated lung, although cavitation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. There is also left lower lobe opacity, to a lesser extent, which could also represent additional site of infection, malignancy, aspiration. No evidence of left pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The aorta is slightly tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
