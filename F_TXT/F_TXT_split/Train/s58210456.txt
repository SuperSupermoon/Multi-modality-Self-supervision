Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and ventricle, unchanged. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle is nonspecific but a trace right pleural effusion is not excluded. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
