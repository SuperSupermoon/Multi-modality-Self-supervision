Lung volumes are low. There are bibasilar consolidations, which most likely represent atelectasis, as seen on CT abdomen. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Heart size is mildly enlarged but likely exaggerated by low lung volumes and AP technique. An esophageal catheter tip projects over the left upper quadrant. Endotracheal tube tip projects approximately 3 cm above the carina. Right-sided central venous catheter tip terminates in the region of the cavoatrial junction. Baclofen catheter projects over the spine. Dilated colon is noted, as seen on subsequent CT.
