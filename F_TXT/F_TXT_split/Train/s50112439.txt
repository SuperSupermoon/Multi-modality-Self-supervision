As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular vein catheter was removed. The patient is slightly rotated, which leads to improved visibility of existing and unchanged right lung opacities with air bronchograms. Small bilateral pleural effusions and retrocardiac atelectasis persists. No evidence of newly appeared parenchymal opacities. No evidence of pneumothorax. The right PICC line is unchanged.
