The endotracheal tube terminates 4.2 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube is visualized with the tip in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax. There is no overt pulmonary edema or large pleural effusions. Consolidation in the lung bases, left greater than right, may be secondary to atelectasis, though aspiration or pneumonia are also within the differential. The remainder of the lungs appear clear. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is noted.
