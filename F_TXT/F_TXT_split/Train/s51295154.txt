Single portable upright chest radiograph was provided. Compared to the prior radiograph, there has now been interval worsening of interstitial opacities consistent with progressive pulmonary edema. More dense parenchyma in the right lower lung may be more confluent edema; however, pneumonia cannot be excluded. The heart remains enlarged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
