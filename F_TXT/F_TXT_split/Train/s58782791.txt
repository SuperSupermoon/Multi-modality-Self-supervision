Since the prior study, the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed. Bilateral chest tubes remain in-situ. No pneumothorax seen. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely reflecting residual pleural fluid. The right-sided chest tube is very close to the chest wall with a side hole just at the chest wall. No consolidation seen. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged in appearance. No free air seen under the diaphragm.
