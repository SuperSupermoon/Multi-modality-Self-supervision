There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube which terminates in the left axillary soft tissues outside of the rib cage. Small post-procedural left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is new since the prior exam. There has been interval re-expansion of the left lung with a residual moderate left pneumothorax. All remaining support devices are in satisfactory position. Small pneumopericardium is unchanged. The right lung remains clear.
