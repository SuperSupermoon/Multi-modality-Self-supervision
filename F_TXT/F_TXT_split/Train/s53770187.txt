Comparison is made to the prior study a day earlier. Cardiac size is top normal. ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the low SVC. NG tube tip is in the proximal duodenum. Aeration of the right lower lobe has improved. Pleural effusions are likely present, difficult to evaluate due to the position of the patient. Right rib fractures are again noted. Mild pulmonary edema has improved.
