In comparison to prior chest radiograph of 1 day earlier, note is made of free intraperitoneal air, likely postoperative in the setting of esophagectomy procedure. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Worsening bibasilar atelectasis and new small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Previously reported small left apical pneumothorax has decreased in size. No other relevant change.
