Background pulmonary edema is improving, but severe consolidation persists in the lower lobes right greater than left. Whether this is residual edema or concurrent pneumonia due to aspiration is difficult to say. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are stable. Heart is normal size. Pulmonary vascular congestion is mild. ET tube in standard position. Right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC. Nasogastric tube is coiled in a nondistended stomach. No pneumothorax. Although no fracture is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of chest cage lesions. Any focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
