The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The chest is hyperinflated. There is similar mild volume loss in the left upper chest with widespread opacification and pleural thickening. There is no definitive change in this area since the prior study, although the upper part of a left suprahilar density appears perhaps somewhat more dense. More clear change is new destruction of the right posterior fifth rib with overlying opacity worrisome for metastatic disease.
