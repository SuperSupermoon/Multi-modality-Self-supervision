PRESENCE OF MODERATE BILATERAL PLEURAL EFFUSION MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE THE CONDITION OF THE LUNGS. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL ATELECTASIS IN LEFT LOWER LOBE REFLECTED IN ELEVATION OF THE LEFT HEMIDIAPHRAGM, WITH A DILATED GASTRIC BUBBLE BELOW. ON THE RIGHT MORE DISCRETE AREAS OF AIR OPACIFICATION IN THE MIDLUNG LATERALLY COULD BE ATYPICAL COLLECTIONS OF FISSURAL PLEURAL FLUID, OR FOCAL PNEUMONIA.TRACHEOSTOMY TUBE IN STANDARD POSITION. UPPER ENTERIC DRAINAGE TUBE PASSES INTO THE NONDISTENDED STOMACH AND OUT OF VIEW. LEFT PIC LINE ENDS AT THE ORIGIN OF THE SVC. NO PNEUMOTHORAX.
