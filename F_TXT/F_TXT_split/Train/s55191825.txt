Since the prior radiograph of earlier the same date, a Swan-Ganz catheter has been repositioned, with tip now terminating in the right ventricular outflow track. There continues to be redundancy and looping of the catheter more proximally in the right atrium. Exam is otherwise remarkable for interval worsening of pulmonary edema and slight increase in size of a small right pleural effusion. No other relevant change.
