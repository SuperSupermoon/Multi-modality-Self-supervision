Swan-Ganz catheter has been advanced slightly, now terminating in the central right hilar region in the expected location of the right interlobar pulmonary artery. Cardiomediastinal contours appear slightly less widened, which may be due to improved volume status of the patient. New left retrocardiac opacity most likely represents atelectasis, and note is also made of small bilateral pleural effusions. No visible pneumothorax.
