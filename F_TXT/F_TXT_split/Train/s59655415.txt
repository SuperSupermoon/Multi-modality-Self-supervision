The patient isrotated. There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube with tip projecting over the mid trachea, approximately 4.4 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular catheter is in similar position. Lung volumes are slightly improved compared to prior with mild interstitial edema. Heart size again appears enlarged. Calcified tortuous aorta is again noted. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is detected on this view.
