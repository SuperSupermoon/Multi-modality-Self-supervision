Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. Heart size and mediastinum appear to be unchanged and there is still redemonstration of prominence of ascending aorta in combination with aberrant right subclavian artery. Pronounced fat pad is redemonstrated as well. Since the prior study, there is interval improvement of pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural plaques are redemonstrated as well as right basal opacity most likely consistent with a combination of pleural plaque and area of chronic scarring although potentially infectious process is a possibility, please correlate clinically.
