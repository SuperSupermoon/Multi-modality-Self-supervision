ET tube terminates approximately 5.3 cm from the carina in the mid thoracic trachea. Enteric tube is difficult to visualize but appears to course beyond the left hemidiaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. The lungs are normally expanded and clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
