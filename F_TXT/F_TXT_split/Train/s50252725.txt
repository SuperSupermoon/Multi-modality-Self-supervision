As compared to the previous radiograph, the lungs are better ventilated, notably on the right. However, relatively diffuse and widespread both interstitial and alveolar opacities persist. The presence of a small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Unchanged monitoring and support devices. No pneumothorax.
