Bronchovascular markings are accentuated by low lung volumes. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Opacification at the left lung base is likely due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Endotracheal tube terminates within the right mainstem bronchus, and should be withdrawn by approximately 6-7 cm. The enteric tube terminates in at least the stomach, although the tip extends beyond the inferior margin of this image. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the right atrium.
