As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right chest tube. The extent of the pre-existing pleural effusion has massively decreased. The effusion is now restricted to the costophrenic sinus. Areas of basal atelectasis are seen. Parts of the opacities could be caused by re-expansion pulmonary edema. The lung is otherwise normal. There is no post-procedural pneumothorax. Normal appearance of the left lung, a pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis is resolved in the interval.
