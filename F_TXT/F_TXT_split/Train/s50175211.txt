AP chest compared to ___: Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. No mediastinal widening or pneumothorax. Severe peribronchiolar infiltration, left mid and lower lung and the right lower lung zones has worsened since ___, attributable to more severe aspiration. Since heart size remains normal and there is no appreciable vascular congestion, I cannot attribute this to pulmonary edema superimposed on changes of chronic aspiration. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. Right supraclavicular central venous line ends in the right atrium, left PIC line in the low SVC as before. Aortic endograft unchanged in position, aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
