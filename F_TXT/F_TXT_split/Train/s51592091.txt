Bibasilar haze likely reflects known pleural effusion; underlying bibasilar densities are non-specific and may represent atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded. Lung volumes are low. There is mild interstitial edema. Lobular mediastinal densities likely correspond to lymphadenopathy seen on prior CT and appears progressed. Heart size is top normal. No pneumothorax is detected on this view. Large left upper lobe nodular opacity is again noted and likely corresponds to known metastatic mass. Right-sided hemodialysis catheter is seen with tip possibly terminating within the right atrium, although not well evaluated on this study.
