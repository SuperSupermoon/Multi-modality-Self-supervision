Right-sided Port-A-Cath is in stable position. Persistent hyperinflation of the lungs is re- demonstrated. Left base opacity is persistent. Right mid to lower lung opacities may be minimally improved, but persist. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle new since the prior study, which could be due to a trace pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
