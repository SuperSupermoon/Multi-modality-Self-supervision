The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 5.5 cm above the carina. A left-sided PICC line terminates in the mid superior vena cava. The right lung remains clear, while persistent retrocardiac opacification is unchanged on the left. On this study, hazy opacification also suggests a small to moderate layering pleural effusion on the left.
