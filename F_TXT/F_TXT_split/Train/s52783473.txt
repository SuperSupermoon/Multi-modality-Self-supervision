In comparison to the most recent examination, the endotracheal, nasogastric, and right central venous lines are in unchanged position. There appears to be slightly progressed indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature which may be related to technique, consistent with persistent pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is mildly, stable enlarged. Right basilar atelectasis is noted. Consolidation is not excluded. Lungs are better inflated than on examination dated ___ with reexpansion of right lower lobe.
