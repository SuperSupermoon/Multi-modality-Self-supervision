The patient is status post sternotomy, with apparent prosthetic valve. A left IJ central line tip overlies the distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. There is cardiomegaly, similar to the prior film. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular plethora, slightly more pronounced than on the prior film. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower Lat left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior film. As before, the possibility of a left-sided effusion cannot be excluded. On the right, there is opacity at the right lung base, suggestive of a right pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, also overall similar to the prior film. A pigtail catheter overlies the right mid abdomen.
