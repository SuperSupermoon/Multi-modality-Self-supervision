Evaluation of the lung bases is limited (particularly the left base) due to overlying soft tissue attenuation. The heart is enlarged but stable on this AP radiograph. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion as well as likely mild CHF. There is no pneumothorax. There may be a small to moderate left pleural effusion however evaluation is limited due to soft tissue attenuation.
