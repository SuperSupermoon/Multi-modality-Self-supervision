The heart is moderately enlarged. There is a moderate-sized left effusion that is increased compared to prior. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution and alveolar infiltrate suggesting an element of fluid overload; however, in addition, there is more dense alveolar infiltrate involving the left lower lobe. It is unclear if this is due to an infectious process. Chronic right upper lobe and lower lobe lung changes are again visualized.
