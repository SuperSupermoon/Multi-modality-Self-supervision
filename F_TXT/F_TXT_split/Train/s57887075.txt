As compared to the previous radiograph, after abdominal surgery, abdominal air is still visible in subphrenic location. The patient has received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable. The tip of the tube, however, only projects over the gastroesophageal junction. The tube should be advanced by at least 5 to 10 cm. The patient has also received a left-sided hemodialysis catheter. The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip projects over the right atrium. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.
