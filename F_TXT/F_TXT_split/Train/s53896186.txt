AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained seven hours earlier during the same day. Again, the patient is presently extubated. Previously described sternotomy wires, surgical clips following lobectomy appear unchanged. Apparently bronchoscopic efforts have been made to improve aeration of the right-sided lung. There is a mild improvement with increased aeration in the central portion of the right hemithorax. The degree of aeration of the remaining right lower lobe, however, is still not completely restored. No other significant interval changes can be identified.
