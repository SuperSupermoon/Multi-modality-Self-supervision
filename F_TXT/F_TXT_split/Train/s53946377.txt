Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Again, there are multiple right-sided rib fractures with overlying soft tissue emphysema along the right chest wall extending into the right neck.

The above findings were discussed with ___ at 5:15 p.m. on ___, 5 minutes after discovery. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle raises concern for a small pleural effusion.
