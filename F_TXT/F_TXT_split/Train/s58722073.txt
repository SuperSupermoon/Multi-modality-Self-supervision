An endotracheal tube is low within the trachea, 1.1 cm from the carina, and pointing towards the right main stem bronchus. Repositioning by at least 2 cm is recommended. An enteric catheter is at least below the diaphragm though the tip is incompletely imaged. Bibasilar opacities have increased in the interval and may be due to increasing pleural fluid as there is also increased pulmonary vascular congestion and edema. There is no pneumothorax. Enlargement of the bilateral hila is likely secondary to vascular engorgement.
