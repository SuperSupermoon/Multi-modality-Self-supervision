AP chest compared to only recent prior chest radiograph, ___: Asymmetric pulmonary abnormality is new, characterized as generalized increase in background density and interstitial abnormality in both lungs, with a right infrahilar and left perihilar prominence. It could be simple pulmonary edema or edema with aspiration pneumonia. Depending upon clinical circumstances, transfusion reaction or aspiration should be added to the list of possibilities. The heart is not enlarged, pleural effusion, if any, is small, and there is no mediastinal vascular engorgement, so that I doubt simple cardiac edema. Right subclavian infusion port ends in the low SVC. An upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper portion of a non-distended stomach. Midline drains are noted, but not identifiable. Dr. ___ was paged at 9:48 a.m. as soon as the findings were recognized.
