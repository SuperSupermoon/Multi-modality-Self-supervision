An esophageal stent is in unchanged position. A left Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium, unchanged from prior. A left PleurX drain terminates in the medial left lung base. There is a persistent left apical pneumothorax, though it has decreased in size since the most recent prior examination. A small right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis appear unchanged from prior. There is overall improved aeration of the left lung base which may be secondary to reduction in the left pleural effusion or possibly decreased atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged.
