As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been advanced. The tip of the tube now projects 3.6 cm above the carina. The other monitoring and support devices are constant. The size of the cardiac silhouette as well as the diffuse bilateral predominantly alveolar opacities in the lung parenchyma in the absence of major pleural effusions is constant. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
