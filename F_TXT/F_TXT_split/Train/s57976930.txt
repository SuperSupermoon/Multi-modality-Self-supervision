As compared to the previous radiograph, a minimal left pleural effusion might have occurred. Subsequent blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, with areas of atelectasis at the left lung base. Moderate fluid overload. Slightly increased size of the cardiac silhouette. In the interval, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The pleural and mediastinal drains as well as the Swan-Ganz catheter are still in place. No evidence of pneumothorax.
