In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a large-bore right IJ catheter with its tip in the mid portion of the SVC and no evidence of pneumothorax. Little change in the atelectatic or fibrotic streaks bilaterally. No convincing evidence of consolidation, though a lateral view if clinically possible could be helpful for detecting this process.
