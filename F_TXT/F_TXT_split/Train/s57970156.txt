Single portable AP supine chest radiograph provided. Multiple overlying EKG leads are noted limiting assessment. The endotracheal tube resides 2.1 cm above the carina. The endogastric tube extends inferiorly along the thoracic midline though its inferior extent is not included within the field of view. Diffuse pulmonary opacity is consistent with large volume aspiration and pulmonary edema as seen on subsequent CT.
