Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. Aorta is tortuous. Lung volumes have improved compared to the prior study, and previously present area of opacity in the left lower lobe has markedly improved with only minimal residual atelectasis remaining. Small left pleural effusion has also slightly decreased in size. Right hemidiaphragm remains minimally elevated.
