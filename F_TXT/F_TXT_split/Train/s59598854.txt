On the left, a 1 to 2 mm apicolateral pneumothorax is now seen (the patient has a small pleural drain). On the right, there is unchanged evidence of an extensive loculated pleural effusion. The larger part of the catheter in the pleural space is located in air collection at the lateral bases of the right hemithorax. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No new focal parenchymal opacities.
