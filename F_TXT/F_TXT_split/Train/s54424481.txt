New endotracheal tube in standard position. Sharp definition of the cuff shows secretions pooling above it. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC. No new thorax or mediastinal widening. Opacification in the left lower lobe is probably atelectasis, given depression of the left hilus, but pneumonia vertically due to aspiration is possible. Loss of volume, bronchiectasis, and pleural thickening at the right apex are probably chronic scarring, not appreciably changed since ___. Heart is moderately enlarged and pulmonary vasculature in the non emphysematous portions of the lung is dilated, but there is no pulmonary edema.
