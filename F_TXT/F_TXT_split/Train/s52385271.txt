An NG tube has been placed. The tip overlies what is thought to represent the lower right lung and does not clearly pass beyond the GE junction. The NG tube lies to the right of midline along its entire course. The patient's anatomy is atypical. Allowing for this, it is unlikely that this NG tube has passed into the stomach. Extensive background abnormalities are similar to the prior film, allowing for differences in the patient positioning. No pneumothorax detected.
