As compared to ___ chest radiograph, pulmonary edema has nearly resolved, and bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size. Residual heterogeneous opacity at the right lung base may be due to a combination of resolving edema and atelectasis but continued radiographic followup would be helpful to exclude the possibility of underlying pneumonia. A possible small right apical pneumothorax is difficult to assess due to superimposition of external structures in this region and may also be reassessed on short-term followup radiograph.
