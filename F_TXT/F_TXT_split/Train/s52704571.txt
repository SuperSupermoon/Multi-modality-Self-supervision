Lung volumes are low. Heart size is appears mildly enlarged but similar. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with a small left pleural effusion, perhaps increased in the interval. Patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region may reflect atelectasis, though infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
