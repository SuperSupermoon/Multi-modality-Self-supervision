Comparison is made to previous study from ___. Heart size is within normal limits. There is increased elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with a left retrocardiac opacity since the previous study. There is some left basilar atelectasis. Pacemaker and venous catheter are unchanged. There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 9 cm above the carina at the level of the clavicular heads. This could be advanced slightly for more optimal placement.
