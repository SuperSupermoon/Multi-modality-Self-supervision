Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval intubation with the endotracheal tube approximately 2 cm from the carina. The orogastric tube terminates in the stomach. There is significant cardiomegaly and calcification of the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. Pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial abnormality, particularly at the right lung base, has progressed since the prior chest radiograph. No strong evidence for pneumonia.
