Interval placement of endotracheal tube with tip terminating 4.4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm at least within the distal stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities affecting the right lung to a slightly greater degree than the left have progressed in the interval, and may reflect pulmonary edema with or without coexisting infection. In the appropriate clinical setting, pulmonary hemorrhage is an additional consideration.
