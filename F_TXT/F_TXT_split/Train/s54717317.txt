The lung volumes are low. Mild- to moderate-sized right pleural effusion and associated right lung base atelectasis is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unusually large but its appearance may be exaggerated because of the low lung volumes. Hardware devices are seen in the cervicothoracic and lower thoracic spine. Left lung base and the left costophrenic angle is obscured by the apparently large cardiomediastinal silhouette. Left upper lungs appear clear.
