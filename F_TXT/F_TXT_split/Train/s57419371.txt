If edema was present previously it has improved. There is still substantial heterogeneous consolidation in the left lung and perhaps some of the right base due to either the asymmetric residual of edema or multi focal pneumonia. The heart is normal size. Pleural effusion is small on the right if any. No pneumothorax.
