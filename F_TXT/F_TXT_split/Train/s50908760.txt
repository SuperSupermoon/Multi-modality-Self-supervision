The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable from 06:07. There is persistent volume loss and collapse involving the right upper and right middle lobes, which is stable to minimally increased from the prior examination. The left lung appears clear. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. A nasogastric tube descends and terminates within the stomach, likely at the pylorus.
