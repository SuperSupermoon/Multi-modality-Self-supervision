The apparent widening of the mediastinum in the region of the right lower paratracheal station, could be juxta mediastinal pleural fluid loculation or localized mediastinal collection. Its overall volume is unchanged since ___ although the configuration has changed. Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has not changed over the past several days, but pulmonary vascular congestion visible in the left lung has increased and there is now borderline interstitial edema.
