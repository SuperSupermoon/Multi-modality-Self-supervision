Comparison is made with prior study performed one hour earlier. ET tube is in standard position. The tip is 3.5 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Severe pulmonary edema has worsened. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right PICC tip is in the low SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Amount of pleural effusion is difficult to evaluate given the projection.
