AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lung volumes are quite low, exaggerating what is mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis, which could in combination explain hypoxia. Heart is poorly defined, but mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. Markedly elevated right hemidiaphragm could obscure right pleural effusion. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses.
