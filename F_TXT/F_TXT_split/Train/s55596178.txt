Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC. Feeding tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, distal aspect not seen but courses at least into the stomach and possibly more distal. An endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 4.6 cm above the level of the carina. Bibasilar opacities persist, similar to prior, with possible slight improvement at the right costophrenic angle. There is increased obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm which may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.
