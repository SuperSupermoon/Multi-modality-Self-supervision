The heart is not enlarged. There are patchy opacities throughout much of both lungs, most pronounced in the right upper and left lower zones. Subtler changes are likely present in other areas of the lung. Compared with ___, the appearance is fairly similar, though perhaps slightly more pronounced in both the right upper zone and left base. Compared with ___, the appearance is probably slightly more pronounced at left base, though not definitely changed in the right upper zone. On today's film, changes at the left base have a more branching, nodular appearance than on the two prior films. Compared to a more remote film from ___, the appearance is more similar, but remains slightly worse at the left base. The appearance is not suggestive of CHF and no effusions are identified. No pneumothorax is detected. Apparent drain-like tubing overlying the upper abdomen, unchanged.
