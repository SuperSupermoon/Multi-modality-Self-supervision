Compared to prior chest radiographs ___. The large area of consolidation in the right upper lobe developed between ___, along with a similar area in the perihilar left lung and worsened subsequently. Both areas were still abnormal on ___ when the patient also had mild pulmonary edema elsewhere in the lungs. Subsequently edema has improved, and so has the consolidation, particularly in the perihilar left lung. The sequence of changes is extremely unusual ; I do not think these areas of recurrent pneumonia as referenced. Perhaps these are areas of lung injury from radiation or drug toxicity and have an lower threshold for edema than the rest of the lungs. Pattern is not consistent with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis or malignancy. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Small bilateral pleural effusions are still present. There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. Supraclavicular central venous infusion catheter ends in the low SVC.
