As compared to the previous radiograph, the intraaortic balloon pump has been pulled back by approximately 1 cm. The pump is now in correct position. The other monitoring and support devices are constant. The lung volumes have slightly decreased, potentially as a result of decreased ventilatory pressure. No evidence of new parenchymal changes, pre-existing pulmonary edema and basal areas of atelectasis are unchanged.
