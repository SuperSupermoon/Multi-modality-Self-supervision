An enteric tube is demonstrated which is seen in suboptimal positioning with the tip proximal to the gastroesophageal junction. A right internal jugular central venous catheter is within the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is present with left ventricular predominance. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications. Low lung volumes are present. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Small left pleural effusion is noted with left basilar atelectasis. Multiple clips are again noted within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
