Relatively low lung more volumes are noted with bibasilar opacities which may be due to atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette likely accentuated by poor inspiratory effort with possible superimposed mild cardiomegaly. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is noted. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch. Old healed right posterior rib fracture is noted. There is no acute osseous abnormality. No free intraperitoneal air.
