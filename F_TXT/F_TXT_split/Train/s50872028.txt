Enteric feeding tube coursing mid line with tip within the stomach and side ports below the level of the diaphragm. An endotracheal tube is seen 6 cm above the level of the carina at the inferior level of the clavicles. A left subclavian port tip is seen within the mid SVC. The lungs are well inflated. No pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. 2.8 x 0.9 cm ovoid opacity projecting over the right mid lung is noted. An additional 1.7 x 1.0 cm opacity projecting over the right lower lobe is most consistent with a pulmonary vessel on end. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is noted with associated retrocardiac atelectasis. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable. Calcifications of the aortic knob are noted. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is unremarkable and osseous structures are within normal limits.
