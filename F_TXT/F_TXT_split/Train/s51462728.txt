The heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Linear opacities within the lung bases persist, and may reflect a combination of scarring with atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
