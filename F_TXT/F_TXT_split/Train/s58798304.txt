Allowing for patient rotation, cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened and is accompanied by interstitial edema as well as an area of asymmetrical increasing airspace opacity in the right infrahilar region. The latter could reflect asymmetrical edema or a developing area of pneumonia. Left retrocardiac atelectasis has slightly worsened, and moderate right and small left pleural effusions are not appreciably changed.
