The lungs are hypoinflated which exaggerate pulmonary vascular markings. Mild atelectatic changes are visualized bilaterally, but the lungs are without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. A linear density along the lateral wall of the left lung is likely scarring. The endotracheal tube tip is visualized in the mid trachea, approximately 3.7 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is visualized coiled in the hypopharynx with the tip at the gastroesophageal junction. Cardiac silhouette is normal. Mediastinal silhouette appears minimally widened, likely due to vascular engorgement.
