The ET tube is 2.6 cm above the carina. The appearance of the left chest tube and NG tube are unchanged. There also appears to be an esophageal probe with tip just below the gastroesophageal junction. Subcutaneous gas is seen on the left. There is probably a small left apical pneumothorax but it is difficult to delineate.
