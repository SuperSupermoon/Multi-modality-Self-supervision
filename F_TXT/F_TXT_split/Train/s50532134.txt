Poor positioning and lung hypoinflation causing vascular crowding limit radiographic assessment. Allowing for these limitations, ill-defined opacities are noted in both lung bases. In the right these opcities are superimposed to areas of costochondral calcification making assessment difficult. A band-like opacity is noted transversing the right apex vertically with some surgical clips projecting over this opacity, which is unchanged compared with prior exam and likely represents a band of pulmonary scarring or pleural thickening. No other focal opacities are seen. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, right greater than left. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are not significantly changed compared with prior study. The aorta is tortuous and calcifications are again seen in the aortic knob. There is no pneumothorax. Sternotomy wires are intact. Clips from CABG are noted. A right-sided mid line catheter is noted ending approximately at the level of the right shoulder. Severe degenerative changes of the right shoulder are chronic as well as a prosthetic left shoulder.
