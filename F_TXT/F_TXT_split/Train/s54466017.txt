The patient is markedly rotated which limits assessment. The endotracheal tube is positioned with its tip approximately 2 cm above the carina, this is improved compared to the prior study. Bilateral diffuse airspace opacities are slightly improved when compared to the prior study. Again this may reflect pulmonary edema versus infection. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the distal SVC.
