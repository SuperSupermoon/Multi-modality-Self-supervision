Mild increased prominence of interstitial markings likely exagerated by low lung volumes. No dense focal opacifications identified. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident. No osseous abnormality evident. Enteric catheter courses below left hemidiaphragm and out of view. Endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina.
