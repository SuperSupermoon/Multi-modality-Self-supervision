Huge midline gastrointestinal hernia, probably through the esophageal hiatus, is chronic, responsible for considerable atelectasis at the left base. Considerable right lower lobe atelectasis is also long-standing. The upper lungs are clear. Heart size is indeterminate but probably not enlarged. No pneumothorax. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
