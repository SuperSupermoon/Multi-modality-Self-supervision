In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the right chest tube has been removed. There is a curvilinear line in the right apical region that simulates a pneumothorax, though there appear to be normal lung markings extending beyond it. Repeating the study in another 3 hr could be helpful in completely excluding a developing pneumothorax after chest tube removal. The remainder the study is unchanged.
