Moderately severe postoperative pulmonary edema is probably unchanged, but looks more severe due to lower lung volumes following tracheal extubation. Small pleural effusions are present. No pneumothorax. Normal postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette. Left pleural drain, midline drains, and right internal jugular line are in standard placements. Nasogastric tube has also been removed and the stomach is mildly distended with air and fluid.
