Interval extubation. Interval removal of the mediastinal drains, left chest tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter. A right internal jugular introducing catheter remains in place with its tip in the proximal SVC. Status post median sternotomy for CABG and valve replacement with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Patchy bibasilar opacities have appeared likely reflecting atelectasis in the setting of diminished lung volumes. Possible small left effusion. Small left apical pneumothorax.
