In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The patient has taken a better inspiration, which may account for the decreased prominence of the cardiac silhouette.

More coalescent areas of opacification, especially at the bases medially, could represent areas of aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting.
