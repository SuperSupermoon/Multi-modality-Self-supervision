An ET tube is present -- the tip lies at the level of the mid clavicular head. Although the carina is not well delineated, it appears to lie approximately 4.4 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present -- the tip probably lies in the region of the GE junction, probably just beyond it. Right IJ central line tip overlies the proximal SVC. Compared with the prior film, the overall appearance is similar, with low lung volumes, prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, and alveolar opacities in both lungs. There is some increased confluence of opacities in the right lung, compared to the prior film. No gross effusion.
