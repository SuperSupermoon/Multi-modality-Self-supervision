Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube tip is still low 14 mm from the carina, should be withdrawn for more standard position. Bibasilar opacities have increased consistent with increasing atelectasis. The right lateral cardiophrenic angle was not included on this film. There are probably small bilateral pleural effusions. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Drains in the upper abdomen are again noted. Evaluation of free air in the abdomen is limited given the projection. There is mild vascular congestion.
