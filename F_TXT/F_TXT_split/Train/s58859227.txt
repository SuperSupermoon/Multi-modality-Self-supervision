A chest tube is present on the left with the tip in the mid to upper lung field. There is a small left pneumothorax. There is no pneumothorax on the right. There is a fracture of the left lateral fourth and possibly posterior second ribs. There is diffuse interstitial and alveolar density bilaterally which may have a significant chronic component. Correlation with prior exams would be helpful. This makes study difficult to evaluate for CHF. Aortic calcifications are present. The aorta is tortuous.
