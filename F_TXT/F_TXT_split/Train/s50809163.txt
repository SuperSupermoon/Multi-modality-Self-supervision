1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the superior vena cava. A right PICC line has its tip in the proximal SVC. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 2. There is bilateral interstitial abnormality which likely reflects mild interstitial pulmonary edema. A right pleural effusion remains. The heart is stably enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. The aorta is calcified, consistent with atherosclerosis. Focal patchy opacity at the right base may represent an area of confluent edema or possibly pneumonia or atelectasis. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
