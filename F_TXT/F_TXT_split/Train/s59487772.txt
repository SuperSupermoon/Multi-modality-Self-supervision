There is extensive, diffuse bilateral subcutaneous emphysema involving the chest bilaterally, with extension into the neck, superior extent not included on the image. The subcutaneous emphysema extends inferiorly along the bilateral chest walls at least to the upper abdomen, inferior aspect not included on the images. Extensive pneumomediastinum is seen, better assessed on subsequent CT. There are bibasilar opacities which may be due to atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia. Subtle lucency at the right costophrenic angle may be due to a small pneumothorax and/or a large bulla. Lucency of the upper lungs bilaterally is consistent with severe pulmonary emphysema.
