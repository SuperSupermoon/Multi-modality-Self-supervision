Relatively mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, raising the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. Hazy opacification at the right base is consistent with pleural effusion. On the left, there is more extensive opacification with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and accompanying effusion.
