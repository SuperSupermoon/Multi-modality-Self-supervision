Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the patient in a semi upright position. Lung volumes remain very low. There is increased right interstitial edema when compared to prior study. The opacity at the right lung base is unchanged, and may represent bronchovascular crowding. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardio mediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Large amount of intraperitoneal gas is again visualized and confirmed by CT performed today.
