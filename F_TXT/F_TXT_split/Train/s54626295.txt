A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained. Pulmonary aeration has decreased. Moderate to large layering right pleural effusion has increased. Loculated intra-abdominal air projects over the right lung base. Central pulmonary vascular congestion is similar. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. An endotracheal tube ends 2.5 cm above the carina. An enteric tube passes inferiorly below the film. A right subclavian catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
