Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vascularity within the right lung is a more pronounced compared to the left, findings which could suggest mild asymmetric pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity in the right lung base may reflect atelectasis. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace pleural effusion, and there is minimal fluid seen in the right minor fissure. No large left pleural effusion is seen, but the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. There is no pneumothorax. Vascular stent is noted in the right the brachial/axillary region.
