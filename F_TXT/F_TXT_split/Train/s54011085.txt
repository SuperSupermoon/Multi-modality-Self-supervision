There is hazy increased opacity of the right lung base, slightly increased from prior. It is impossible to tell whether this represents a recurrent process of failure to clear of the prior infection. Increase opacity at the left lung base is new. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. Hilar structures are unremarkable.
