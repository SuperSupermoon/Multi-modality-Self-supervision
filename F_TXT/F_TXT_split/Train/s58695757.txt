Again noted is the small post-operative pneumopericardium, which is stable in appearance compared to the last chest radiograph. Median sternotomy wires are in the expected location. Again noted is the left sided chest tube, Swan Ganz catheter, mediastinal drains, endotracheal tube, and a nasogastric tube. There is better ventilation of the left lung compared to the last chest radiograph performed on ___ at 15:18. No large pleural effusions are noted. No evidence of pneumothorax.
