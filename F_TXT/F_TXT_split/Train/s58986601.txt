Comparison is made to ___. The ET tube is 3.6 cm from the carina. There is cardiomegaly. There has been improvement in the bilateral pulmonary opacities that likely represent pulmonary edema. The opacification in the right lung apex and at the right lung base extending into the minor fissure are consistent with pleural effusion and these are stable. A right-sided central venous line is identified with its tip in the distal SVC. NG tube is noted to pass into the stomach. The tip is not depicted on this film.
