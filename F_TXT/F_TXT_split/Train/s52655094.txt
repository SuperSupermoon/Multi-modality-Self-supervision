1. Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. A tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. Lung volumes remain somewhat diminished with patchy opacities at both lung bases which may represent atelectasis or pneumonia. Overall, when compared with prior study, there are more apparent opacities at the left base, but the right base has not changed. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
