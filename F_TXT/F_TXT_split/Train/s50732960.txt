Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities are consistent with aspiration of blood in the setting of massive upper GI bleed. Moderate size right pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis is grossly unchanged. The cardiomediastinal hilar contours are unchanged. Monitoring and support devices are in the appropriate positions.
