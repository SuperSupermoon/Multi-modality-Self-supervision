AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to CT chest obtained slightly prior to that. The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Pacemaker leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. Heart size and mediastinum are grossly stable. Extensive parenchymal consolidations are demonstrated in both perihilar and lower lobe areas associated with minimal pleural effusion, findings which are better assessed on the CT that was obtained 40 minutes prior to that. No pneumothorax is seen.
