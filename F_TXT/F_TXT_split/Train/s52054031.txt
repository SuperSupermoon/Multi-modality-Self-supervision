An endotracheal tube terminates in the right mainstem bronchus. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach. Lung volumes are low. Within the limitations of technique there is no definite abnormality involving cardiac, mediastinal or hilar contours. There is pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is mild leftward shift of mediastinal structures and vague asymmetric opacification of the left lung. Streaky opacities at the right lung base suggest minor atelectasis.
