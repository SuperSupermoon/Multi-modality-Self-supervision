A dual lead left-sided pacer remains in place with its leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are stable. There continues to be bibasilar opacity which is likely not significantly changed and more likely represents partial lower lobe atelectasis given the presence of stable small pleural effusions, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
