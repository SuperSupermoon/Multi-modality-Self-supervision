Portable semi upright chest radiograph was obtained. Lungs are low in volume resulting in bronchovascular crowding along with right greater than left basal opacities which are likely atelectasis but aspiration could be considered. Mild vascular congestion is seen without overt edema. Bibasilar linear atelectasis is seen. The heart is top normal in size with tortuous aortic contour. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter is seen in the right hemithorax and abdomen. Moderate gaseous gastric distention is noted.
