There is re- demonstration of bilateral lower lung, right greater than left, opacities and small bilateral effusions. These findings are only slightly improved since the radiograph from 8 days prior, and are compatible with dependent edema or superimposed pneumonia. No change in the tracheostomy and right subclavian line positions. No pneumothorax. There has been interval removal of a right IJ line. A small bone island in the right proximal humerus is again seen.
