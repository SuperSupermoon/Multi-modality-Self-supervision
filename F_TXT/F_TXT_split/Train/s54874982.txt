As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. The appearance of the right lung base is unchanged with, however, a small atelectasis due to the decreased lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly. The effusion documented on yesterday's lateral film is not visualized on the frontal film only.
