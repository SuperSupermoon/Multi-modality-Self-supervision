As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing interstitial opacities in both lungs have decreased. There is increased radiolucency of both lungs. However, a zone of relatively increased density remains visible at the bases of the right upper lobe. In addition, there is peribronchial cuffing and mild widening of the vascular structures, potentially reflecting mild fluid overload. No pleural effusions. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. The healed rib fractures on the left and the left femur fracture are constant in appearance.
