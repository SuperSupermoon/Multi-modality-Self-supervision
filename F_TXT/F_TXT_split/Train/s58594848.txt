Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. Midline sternotomy wires and abandoned epicardial pacing leads are seen. Deep brain stimulator devices project over the lateral upper chest. There are diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities which are concerning for pulmonary edema. An atypical pneumonia is also a possibility though thought unlikely. No large effusion or pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinal contour are stable.
