Portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of a left chest tube. Airspace opacity is similar in distribution bilaterally likely reflecting edema accentuated by low lung volumes. A right pleural effusion is increased. The postoperative cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Median sternotomy wires are unchanged. There has been interval removal of an endotracheal tube, NG tube, epicardial pacing wires, right IJ sheath, and Swan-Ganz catheter. There may be a trace left pneumothorax without evidence of tension. The stomach is distended with air.
