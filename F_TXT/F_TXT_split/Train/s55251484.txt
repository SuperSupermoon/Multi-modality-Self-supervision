Left basilar opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is most suggestive of a layering effusion as on prior. Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for technique. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted. Previously seen left central venous catheter is no longer visualized. Tracheostomy tube is also no longer seen.
