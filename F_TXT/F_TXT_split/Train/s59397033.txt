As compared to the previous radiograph, the left PICC line has been pulled back. The tip of the line is now at the level of the optic was vein, projecting over the confluence of the brachiocephalic and superior vena cava. No pneumothorax or other complications. The pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities are constant in extent but the left retrocardiac atelectasis has minimally decreased in severity.
