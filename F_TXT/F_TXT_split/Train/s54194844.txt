AP chest compared to ___ at 4:49 p.m.: Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 5.5 cm above the carina, 3 cm above optimal placement. Nasogastric tube is looped in the hypopharynx and passes into the stomach and out of view. Interval widening of the upper mediastinum could be due to vascular distention alone in the supine patient if she is receiving intravascular volume replacement, but clinical attention needs to be paid to the possibility of mediastinal bleeding, depending upon the current physical findings and mechanism of injury. Dr. ___ was paged at 8:25 a.m. on ___, the time of discovery. Mild heterogeneous opacification in the left upper lung could be atelectasis alone or contusion. Dr. ___ ___ by telephone at ___ and we discussed the absence of evidence of mediastinal bleeding on a preceding torso CT performed roughly five hours before this study and the absence of clinical findings of mediastinal hemorrhage as well as the history of intervening intravenous volume replacement. Following extubation this morning, patient will have repeat chest radiograph in a semi-erect or erect position to confirm the presumption that current mediastinal widening is due to venous engorgement and not bleeding.
