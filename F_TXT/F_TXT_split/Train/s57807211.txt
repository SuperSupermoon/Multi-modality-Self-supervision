Lung volumes are low with bibasilar atelectasis, more prominent of the left base than the right. There is prominence of the bilateral hila and indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature suggestive of mild congestive heart failure. No frank pulmonary edema seen. An nasoenteric tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm, the tip is not visualized on this study. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. No consolidation or pneumothorax seen.
