Endotracheal tube has the tip 4.4 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the proximal stomach and the side port at or just below the gastroesophageal junction. The heart is upper limits of normal in size given portable technique. Lungs appear well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pleural effusions or pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi supine technique.
