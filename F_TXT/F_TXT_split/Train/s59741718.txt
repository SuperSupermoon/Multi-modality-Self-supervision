Comparison is made to the prior radiograph from ___. There is a cardiomegaly which is stable. There is some atelectasis at the lung bases. There is an element of pulmonary edema. Multiple displaced rib fractures are seen on the left side which are stable. In the left upper lobe, there is a prominent edge within the left upper lobe which is equivocal for pneumothorax and is likely a skin fold. If there is high clinical concern, this could be further evaluated with repeat radiographs with the patient in a different position.
