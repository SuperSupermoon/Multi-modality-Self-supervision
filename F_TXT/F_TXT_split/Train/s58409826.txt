Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of subsegmental atelectasis. The remainder of the lungs appear clear. There is no pneumothorax. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle corresponds with a known small pleural effusion. There is no pulmonary edema or vascular congestion. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior. Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged compared to multiple recent prior examinations.
