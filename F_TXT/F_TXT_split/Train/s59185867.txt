The left-sided chest tubes and right-sided PICC line are stable in position. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. There is opacification of much of the left lung with some aeration at the apex. Much of this likely represents pleural fluid. Left retrocardiac opacity is seen. There may be a small loculated pneumothorax along the left lateral chest wall superiorly.
