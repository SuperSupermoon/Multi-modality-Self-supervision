Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. Small right pleural effusion with associated compressive lower lobe atelectasis is better assessed on same date chest CT. The cardiac silhouette appears prominent though this is attributable to prominent epicardial fat. The left lung is clear. Mediastinal contour is notable for a calcified and unfolded thoracic aorta. No pneumothorax. Degenerative AC joint arthropathy noted bilaterally. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
