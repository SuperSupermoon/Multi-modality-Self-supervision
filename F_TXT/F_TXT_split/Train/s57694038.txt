A single semi-upright AP view of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a large-bore dialysis catheter through an inferior approach, which terminates in the right atrium. Convex bulging of the right mediastinal contour is slightly more conspicuous than on the prior study. The lungs are well inflated and clear bilaterally with no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. Right axillary surgical clips are again noted.
