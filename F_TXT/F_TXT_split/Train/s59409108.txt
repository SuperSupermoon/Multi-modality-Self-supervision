1. Left chest tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. There is improving aeration in the left hemithorax. However, there continues to be partial left upper lobe collapse as well as more patchy areas of opacity in the left mid and lower lung, which also could represent residual atelectasis. Overall, when compared to studies dating from ___, the previously seen pulmonary edema has resolved. There is subcutaneous emphysema within the neck soft tissues. Multiple right-sided rib fractures with associated pleural thickening and patchy opacity at the right base is stable. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the left hemithorax airspace process. No pneumothorax.
