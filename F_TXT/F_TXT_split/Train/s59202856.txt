The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits with calcification of the aortic knob. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The lungs are well-expanded. The left upper lobe lesion appears smaller than on the prior studies, and the prior peripheral left upper lobe pneumonia is resolved. Mild platelike atelectasis at the left lung base is noted. The upper abdomen is unremarkable in appearance.
