Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are seen, suggesting prior asbestos exposure. There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle which could be due to a trace pleural effusion versus pleural thickening. Subtle opacity projecting over the right mid lung could be due pneumonia versus underlying pleural plaques, appears new/increased as compared to the prior study. Dedicated PA and lateral views when patient able could be helpful for further evaluation. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
