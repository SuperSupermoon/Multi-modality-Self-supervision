Since the patient was intubated on ___ the heterogeneous opacification predominantly in the lung apices has improved, more so on the right than the left. This is most likely due to clearing pulmonary edema. Basal predominant emphysema and lung scarring including bronchiectasis and scattered areas of peripheral pulmonary fibrosis are better demonstrated on the chest CT. Heart size is top-normal. Pleural effusions are small if any. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified but not focally dilated. The combination and distribution of lung abnormalities on the chest CT scan raises the imaged and possibility that this patient may be a long-term survivor despite alpha one antitrypsin deficiency.
