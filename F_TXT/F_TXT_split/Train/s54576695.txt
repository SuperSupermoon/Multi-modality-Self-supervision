1. Approximately 8.9 cm likely pleural based opacity in mid left hemi thorax is worrisome for loculated fluid collection. Differential includes pneumonia, or asymmetric pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation is recommended. 2. Bilateral perihilar interstitial and alveolar opacities with small left pleural effusion is consistent with pulmonary edema. 3. Prominent right and question left pulmonary hila. Attention to these areas on followup films is requested.
