Lung volumes have improved since ___, accounting in part for some decrease in the very large cardiac silhouette, nevertheless in improvement since ___. Mediastinal veins are still engorged and upper lobe pulmonary vasculature still dilated. There is no pulmonary edema no appreciable pleural effusion. I cannot identify with certainty a catheter fragment projecting over the lower midline mediastinum and left upper quadrant, but it could be a pericardial drain.
