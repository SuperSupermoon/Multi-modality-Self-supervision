Comparison is made to previous study from ___. The heart size is enlarged. There is a left-sided PICC line with distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction, appropriately sited. There is some prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings, suggestive of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. There is minimal blunting of the right CP angle, suggestive of small pleural effusion. No pneumothoraces are present.
