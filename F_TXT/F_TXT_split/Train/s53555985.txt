Endotracheal tube terminates in the mid trachea. Right subclavian catheter has been introduced and terminates in the mid SVC. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach with side hole just beyond the GE junction. Moderate left and small-to-moderate right pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are increased. Fullness in the hila and indistinctness of pulmonary vasculature suggests perhaps mild pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Known rib fractures are not as well assessed on this radiograph.
