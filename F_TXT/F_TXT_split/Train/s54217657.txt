As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the nasogastric tube, the endotracheal tube, right internal jugular vein catheter are unchanged. There is unchanged appearance of the lung parenchyma, with minimal improvement of pre-existing right lower lung opacities. However, relatively important lower lobe atelectasis persists. This atelectasis is accompanied by a small left pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall, normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
