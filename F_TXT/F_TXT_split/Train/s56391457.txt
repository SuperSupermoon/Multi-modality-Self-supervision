As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The monitoring and support devices are constant. Unchanged distribution and severity of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities. No pleural effusions. The nasogastric tube is barely visible at the level of the lower parts of the thorax. The device might have been pulled back. A confirmation radiograph should be obtained within the next few hr.
