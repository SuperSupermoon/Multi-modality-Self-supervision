Rotated positioning. Compared to the prior film, there may have been slight interval improvement in the CHF findings. Otherwise , I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is a left IJ central line with tip over mid SVC an extensive perihilar and parenchymal opacities, including more confluent opacity at the lateral left lung. There may have been subtle improvement in the lateral left chest opacity, but this may also be accentuated by differences in positioning. Minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle is also unchanged. The current film includes the proximal portion of the right humeral diaphysis and shows some increased density there.
