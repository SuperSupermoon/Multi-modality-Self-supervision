A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest tube. There is no pneumothorax. Volume loss of the left lower lung with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with lobectomy. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal, without atelectasis at the left base. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
