AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. An ETT has been placed, seen to terminate 5 cm above the level of the carina. New row of circular sternal wires in midline indicative of recent bypass surgery with multiple small surgical clips in left mediastinum. A right internal jugular approach central venous line has been placed and terminates in the lower SVC just above the expected entrance into the right atrium. An NG tube reaches below the diaphragm and a mediastinal drainage tube from below as well as a left-sided chest tube is in place, the latter terminating in the posterior lateral pleural sinus. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and the lateral pleural sinuses are free from any major pleural effusions. No new parenchymal infiltrates are seen and the pulmonary vasculature is not congested.
