Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina. An intra-aortic balloon pump tip terminates low, approximately 3.0 cm below the left main bronchus level. Lung volumes are low, but no consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. Widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette likely relates to the low lung volumes. Mild aortic knob calcifications are present.
