In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification at the right base. This could reflect some increasing pleural effusion and atelectasis, though it could merely be a manifestation of a more supine position with layering effusion. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. There may be minimal elevation of the pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the left base posteriorly is consistent with some volume loss in the lower lobe.
