Severe cardiac enlargement is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with enlargement of the pulmonary artery compatible with chronic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Mild pulmonary edema is slightly improved compared to the prior study. Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. Blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus is suggestive of a trace pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. Multiple left axillary clips are re- demonstrated.
