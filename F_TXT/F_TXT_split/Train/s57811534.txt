No previous images. There is huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient who has undergone previous CABG procedure and has intact midline sternal wires. Pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits. Some ill-defined opacification at the right base suggests some atelectatic change. The left base is difficult to assess due to the size of the heart, though the hemidiaphragm is quite sharply seen. Discordancy of heart size and vascular congestion raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or possibly even pericardial effusion.
