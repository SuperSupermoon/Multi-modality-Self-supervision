Comparison is made to radiograph dated ___. Single AP semi-erect chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes. Again noted is air-filled and distended stomach projecting across the midline and under the right hemidiaphragm. Hazy opacity projects over the left upper lobe obscuring the left heart border and in the retrocardiac region. The right lung is grossly clear. Heart appears stable in contour relative to prior examination. No overt pulmonary edema. There is no large pleural effusion.
