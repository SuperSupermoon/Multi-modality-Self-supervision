Interval intubation with the tip of the nasogastric tube approximately 6 cm above the carina. Left subclavian central line with its tip in the proximal to mid SVC. A nasogastric tube remains in place with its tip projecting over the stomach. There is improving, but persistent vascular congestion. More focal patchy opacity at the left base persists and may reflect an area of early pneumonia or aspiration, although atelectasis should also be considered. Stably enlarged heart with several more focal radiopaque oval opacities projecting over the left lateral lung field which could reflect calcified pleural plaques. These can be better assessed on PA and lateral imaging when the patient is clinically stable. No pneumothorax.
