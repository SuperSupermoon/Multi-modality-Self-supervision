The study of 00:08 shows no appreciable change in the small to moderate right apical pneumothorax. However, right basilar subsegmental atelectasis and surrounding airspace opacification has increased. The heart and mediastinum are magnified by the projection. A right pectoral Infuse-A-Port is unchanged in position. Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a new small pleural effusion. The followup exam from ___ hr shows worsening right middle and right lower lobe airspace opacification superimposed on subsegmental atelectasis. Superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. The small to moderate right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. There is stable left retrocardiac linear atelectasis.
