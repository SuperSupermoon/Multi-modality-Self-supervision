Worsened bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. Lung volumes are low. The heart is top normal. The aortic arch is calcified. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Curvilinear opacities in the region of the bilateral hemidiaphragms are suspicious for subdiaphragmatic free air but could also reflect air within loops of bowel.
