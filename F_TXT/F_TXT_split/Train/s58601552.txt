Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Pacemaker defibrillator leads terminate in the right ventricle. Heart size is enlarged. Mediastinum is stable. Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Vascular engorgement is noted, but no overt pulmonary edema is noted on the current study. There is interval improvement of left retrocardiac opacity which might be consistent with resolution of atelectasis/infection. No interval development of appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Small amount of pleural effusion, though cannot be excluded.
