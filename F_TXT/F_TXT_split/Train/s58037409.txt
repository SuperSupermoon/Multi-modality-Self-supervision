Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not substantially changed from the previous exam. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. No pulmonary edema is identified. Ill-defined opacification within the left lung base remains similar to the previous study likely reflecting a combination of small pleural effusion and atelectasis though infection is not excluded. Trace right pleural effusion is also likely present along with probable mild right basilar atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
