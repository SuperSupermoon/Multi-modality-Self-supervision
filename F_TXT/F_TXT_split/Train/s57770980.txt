Diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally is re- demonstrated in this patient with chronic lung disease. There is slight increase in opacities bilaterally, which may be due to acute worsening of chronic lung disease versus overlying mild edema versus superimposed infectious process. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Hilar contours are grossly stable. There is slight blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles which could be due to trace pleural effusions versus pleural thickening multiple rib deformities on the right are again seen.
