New endotracheal tube in standard placement. Left internal jugular line tip is in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. Moderate to severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette is probably unchanged, given differences in patient position. Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved, and small right pleural effusion and minimal if any pulmonary edema in the right lower lung are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
