Since a recent chest radiograph of less than 1 hr earlier, a right pigtail pleural catheter is been placed, with decrease in size of right pneumothorax, with small residual pneumothorax remaining. Right upper lobe has partially re-expanded. Right main bronchus appears depressed compared to baseline CT of ___ with adjacent increased opacity in the right paratracheal region. It is uncertain whether this represents residual collapsed lung or a hematoma. Exam is otherwise remarkable for apparent development of a small right pleural effusion.
