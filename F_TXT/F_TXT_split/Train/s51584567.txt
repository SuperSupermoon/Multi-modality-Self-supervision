There is been interval placement of a right supraclavicular large bore catheter, which terminates at the level of the upper to mid SVC. A left EJ catheter is unchanged in the left neck. The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant bronchovascular crowding and accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely within normal limits as on the outside same day radiograph. No infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax is identified. Healed bilateral rib fractures are noted.
