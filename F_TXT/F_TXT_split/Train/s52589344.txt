As compared to the previous examination from yesterday, the extent of the left pleural effusion appears to have moderately decreased. The effusion is now limited to the region of the costophrenic sinus. Simultaneously, the extent of the retrocardiac and left basal atelectasis has decreased, as reflected by an overall increase in transparency of the cardiac silhouette. No parenchymal opacities have newly occurred. No pneumothorax. The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.
