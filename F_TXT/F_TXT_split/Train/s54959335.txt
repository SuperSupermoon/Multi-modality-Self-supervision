Lungs remain hyperinflated suggesting underlying emphysema. Streaky opacities at the bases more likely reflect scarring or subsegmental atelectasis rather than an acute infectious process. However, clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Small left effusion, less apparent on the current study than on the prior. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with the heart being mildly enlarged. Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints with no acute bony abnormality appreciated.
