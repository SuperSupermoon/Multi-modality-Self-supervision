In comparison with the study of ___, there is again a hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is again seen. Prominence of interstitial markings could reflect underlying chronic pulmonary disease, vascular congestion, or both. Opacification at the right base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with atelectatic changes. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, this could be a manifestation of superimposed pneumonia. Prominence of the pulmonary arteries is consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
