Heart size remains moderately enlarged with dense coronary artery calcifications. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is not substantially changed in the interval without frank pulmonary edema. Chain sutures are noted in the right apex. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Multiple clips project over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
