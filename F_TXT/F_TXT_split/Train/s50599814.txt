In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much poor inspiration. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacification less prominent than on the previous study, suggesting elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The left hemidiaphragm is better seen, consistent with some decrease in volume loss in the left lower lung. In the appropriate clinical setting, a superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
