Tracheostomy tube and right PICC remain in unchanged positions. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Persistent bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, although infection is difficult to exclude. Small left pleural effusion is relatively unchanged. Previously noted right pleural effusion appears improved. There is no pneumothorax. No pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. Cholecystectomy clips are noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Percutaneous GJ tube is partially imaged in the upper abdomen.
