An endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is growth within the stomach. A 2 cm irregularly marginated nodular opacity is present in the right upper lobe between the levels of the first and second anterior ribs. Lungs are otherwise remarkable for predominantly left-sided interstitial opacities. Heart is upper limits of normal in size and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion. With pleural thickening in the left mid and lower hemi thorax appears slightly nodular. Periphery of right mid and lower hemi thorax have been excluded from the radiograph, precluding full assessment of the lung parenchyma and pleura in this region.
