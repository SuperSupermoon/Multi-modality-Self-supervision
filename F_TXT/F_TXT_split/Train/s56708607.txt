Bilateral diffuse lung opacities are presisting. On concurrent review with prior chest CT dated ___, these opacities represent a combination of ground-glass opacities and consolidation and bibasilar fibrosis, unchanged since ___, but improved since ___. All these changes are more on the right side and may represent continuing alveolitis. As appreciated on recent chest CT, there was no component of pulmonary edema then nor in today's radiograph. Mild widening of the mediastinum is from increased mediastinal fat in conjunction with multiple lymph nodes as appreciated on the chest CT. There is evidence of prior median sternotomy and sternal sutures are intact. Effusions, if any, are small bilaterally and unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Hilar contours are unremarkable. Aorta has a mild tortuous course and demonstrates mild-to-moderate and severe atherosclerotic calcification.
