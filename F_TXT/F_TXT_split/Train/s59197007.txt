The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and stenting of a bypass graft. Severe cardiac enlargement is relatively similar compared to the previous exam allowing for differences in technique. The aorta remains tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch. Bilateral perihilar haziness with vascular indistinctness and bibasilar opacities likely reflect mild to moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left. There is also likely bibasilar atelectasis, but infection cannot be completely excluded. Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Extensive vascular calcifications are present within the upper abdomen, and multiple calcifications are seen projecting within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen compatible with splenic granulomas. Remote bilateral rib fractures are re- demonstrated.
