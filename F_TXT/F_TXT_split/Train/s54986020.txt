Single frontal view of the chest. Again seen is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely due to an effusion. More dense left basilar opacity is likely in part due to known large hiatal hernia and effusion. Bibasilar opacities may also be from superimposed atelectasis noting infection cannot be excluded. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
