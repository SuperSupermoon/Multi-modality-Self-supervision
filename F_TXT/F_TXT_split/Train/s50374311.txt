Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. Endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located approximately 3.8 cm above the carina. The NG tube courses into the left lower chest, which may reside within a hiatal hernia. The tube does not appear to follow the course of either main stem bronchus, therefore likely residing within the distal esophagus. Cardiomegaly is again noted with retrocardiac opacity, unchanged. Left CP angle excluded. Coarse calcifications in the right breast/axilla.
