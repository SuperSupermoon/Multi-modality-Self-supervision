1. The left pleural pigtail catheter remains in place. No definite left apical pneumothorax is seen. There continued to be parenchymal opacity and distortion in the left upper lung and throughout the right lung. The lungs are also hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contour is difficult to assess given the diffuse process within the right hemithorax. Some air is still seen within the lateral chest wall soft tissues on the left consistent with subcutaneous emphysema.
