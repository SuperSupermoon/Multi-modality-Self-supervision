An endotracheal tube terminates at the carina. There is a moderate-sized left pleural effusion with adjacent left basilar opacification. No right pleural effusion is detected on this view. No pneumothorax is evident on this view. No focal consolidation is seen in the right lung. The aorta is calcified. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema, but pulmonary vascularity is slightly prominent and cephalized, possibly secondary to supine positioning. Old right sided rib fractures are noted.
