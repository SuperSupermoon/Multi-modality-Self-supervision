The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The lungs are hyperinflated and lucent with flattened hemidiaphragms, compatible with severe COPD. However, no lobar consolidation is present and minimal bibasilar atelectasis is noted. Pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT are better evaluated on CT. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
