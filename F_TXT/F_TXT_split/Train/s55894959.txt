Rapid clearing of previous left lower lobe consolidation over just 24 hr indicates that this recent major change was largely resolution of atelectasis, not pneumonia. Improvement at the right base is due largely to decreasing moderate right pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. Left subclavian line, ET tube, and nasogastric feeding tube are in standard placements respectively. No pneumothorax.
