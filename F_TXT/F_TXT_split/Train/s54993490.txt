AP single view obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. The widespread parenchymal infiltrates occupying the major portion of the right hemithorax persist. Again absence of significant pleural effusion is noted as the right lateral pleural sinus appears free. There is no pneumothorax in the apical area. Remarkable in comparison with the next preceding study is that there is now a new appearing infiltrate in perivascular location in the left lower lobe area. Again, also the left-sided pleural space appears free from any fluid accumulation.
