Single portable view of the chest. Streaky right suprahilar opacity is unchanged and is likely due to scarring. Elsewhere, the lungs are clear where not obscured by overlying cardiac leads and wires. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Atherosclerotic calcifications noted in the thoracic aorta. Degenerative changes are seen at the shoulders bilaterally. Old left seventh rib fractures are again identified.
