AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The two right chest tubes are in place. The apical opacity is unchanged. There is interval increase in basal air loculation but decrease in basal pleural effusion. Left lung is unchanged except for mild interstitial engorgement which is new since the prior study. Also new left lower lobe opacity adjacent to the cardiac silhouette is noted but might reflect infection but atelectasis would be another possibility. Attention on the subsequent study is recommended.
