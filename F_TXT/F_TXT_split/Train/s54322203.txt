Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 6.5 cm above the carina and could be advanced a couple of centimeters for optimal positioning. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged in appearance. Persistent partial right lower lobe atelectasis, slightly improved with lesser degree of fissural displacement. Persistent confluent opacity at left base with air bronchograms, minimally improved as demonstrated by improved visualization of left hemidiaphragm and descending aortic interface. Rapid improvement favors atelectasis or aspiration, but followup films may be helpful to exclude infectious consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting.
