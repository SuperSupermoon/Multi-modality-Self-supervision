Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. A single-lead left-sided AICD is again seen with leads extending to the expected position of the right ventricle. A right-sided PICC is again seen, terminating in the low SVC. There is a linear density coursing over the left upper chest and curving downward parallel to the SVC, however, does not appear precisely within the SVC. Correlate with what this structure is; query whether it is external to the patient, if not, may be arterial. These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 8:45 p.m. on ___ via telephone, paged immediately after findings discovered, discussed with him approximately 20 minutes thereafter. There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to pleural thickening, but trace pleural effusion is not excluded. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. No focal consolidation. Patient is status post median sternotomy
