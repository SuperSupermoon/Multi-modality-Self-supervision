A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends 7 cm above the carina and could be advanced for better seating. The left subclavian line ends in the upper SVC. An upper enteric tube ends in the stomach. Lung volumes are slightly lower than on the prior study. The right basilar opacity is unchanged. New left basilar opacity is likely atelectasis given the lower lung volumes. Hyperlucency at the left lung base is likely due to confluence of shadows, unchanged since ___ and unlikely to be a pneumothorax. There is no substantial pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
