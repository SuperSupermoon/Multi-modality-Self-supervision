In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing opacification in the left hemithorax, consistent with enlargement of the pleural effusion on this side. Little change in the degree of effusion on the right. Extensive compressive atelectasis is seen at both bases. The prominent scoliosis makes it difficult to assess for possible shift of the mediastinum. Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
