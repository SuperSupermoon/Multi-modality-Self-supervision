Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance. Extensive calcifications of the descending aorta are present. Lungs are essentially clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Nodular opacity projecting over the tip of the left scapula is present and might potentially represent summation of shadows but a pulmonary nodule is a possibility and S correlation with PA and lateral views or potentially chest CT if clinically warranted would be identified
