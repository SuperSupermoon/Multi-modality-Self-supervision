Evaluation is somewhat limited by patient rotation. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach. Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear within normal limits. Lung volumes are low with patchy opacities in the lung bases, potentially atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. There is likely a small right pleural effusion. There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution which may be accentuated by supine technique. No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. No large pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities detected.
