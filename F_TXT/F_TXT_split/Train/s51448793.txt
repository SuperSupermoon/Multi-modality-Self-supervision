1. Right basilar chest tube has been pulled back. There is persistent but slightly smaller right-sided pneumothorax. Multiple right-sided rib fractures are again identified. The left lung demonstrates persistent retrocardiac airspace disease with an associated effusion, more likely reflecting compressive atelectasis rather than pneumonia or aspiration. Clinical correlation is advised. Overall, the vasculature is better defined suggesting that the interstitial edema has somewhat improved. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given the patient rotation on the current study.
