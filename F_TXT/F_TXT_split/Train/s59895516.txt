The lung volumes are low. Bilateral areas of atelectasis are present. The atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung region shows several air bronchograms. The symmetry of the opacities is more suggestive of atelectasis than of pneumonia. Nevertheless, a lateral radiograph should be obtained to better assess these changes. No larger pleural effusions. Mild cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema.
