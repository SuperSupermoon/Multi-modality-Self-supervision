Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Note is made that left lower lateral chest was not included in the field of view. The ET tube tip is 5.7 cm above the carina. The right central venous line tip is at the level of mid to low SVC. Mild vascular engorgement is noted. Left retrocardiac opacity is new and most likely reflects a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. The vascular engorgement has progressed since the prior study as well. There is no pneumothorax.
