Lung volumes remain low. There is a moderate left-sided pleural effusion, this appears to have increased slightly in extent compared to the prior study. Multiple surgical clips project over the left mid lung. There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube, the tip is in the stomach however the side hole appears to be at the gastroesophageal junction and CT could be advanced several cm.
