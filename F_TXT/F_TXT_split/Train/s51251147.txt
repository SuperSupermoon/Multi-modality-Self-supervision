The tip of the endotracheal tube is somewhat difficult to determine, though appears to be about 7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends at least to the upper stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the image. Hazy opacification in the right hemithorax suggests substantial layering effusion with compressive basilar atelectasis, with less prominent changes on the left. Some of this appearance could well represent scatter radiation related to the size of the patient.
