A frontal portable chest radiograph demonstrates multiple surgical clips overlying the left hemithorax and a right PICC terminating at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged. The patient is rotated, resulting in increased right hilar prominence and apparent heart size. Allowing for changes in position and lower lung volumes, there is no definite focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
