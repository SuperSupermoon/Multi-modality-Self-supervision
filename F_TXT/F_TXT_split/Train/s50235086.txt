A right dual-lead pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. A nasogastric tube is noted with tip not clearly visualized in the field of view. A right IJ catheter appears kinked as before; however, the tip projects over the upper SVC in unchanged position from the prior examination. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged from the prior examination. Stable left lower lobe opacity may represent pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis; however, infectious process such as pneumonia cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical setting. Minimal opacification at the right lung base may also represent atelectasis versus aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia.
