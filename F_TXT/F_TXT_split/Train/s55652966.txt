1. Right-sided pacemaker remains in place and unchanged. A right internal jugular introducer catheter has its tip near the junction of the internal jugular with the superior vena cava. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach in the left upper quadrant. 2. The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG with persistent enlarged cardiac and mediastinal contours. Extensive bilateral subcutaneous emphysema, with a persistent small right apical pneumothorax which is likely unchanged given differences in positioning. There are increasing layering small pleural effusions and increasing indistinctness of the perihilar vasculature, which likely reflects mild pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacity most likely reflects compressive atelectasis rather than pneumonia given the presence of the pleural effusion.
