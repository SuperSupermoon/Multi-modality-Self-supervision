New bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right as well as new pulmonary vascular congestion. Unchanged patchy opacities at the right lung apex and left lung base. No pneumothorax identified. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged. Coronary vascular calcification. Prominence of the the mid to upper mediastinum may reflect widening of the vascular pedicle or may be technical secondary to patient positioning. Osseous structures suggest underlying renal osteodystrophy.
