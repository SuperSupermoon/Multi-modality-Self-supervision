The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable, within normal limits. The thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous, with aortic arch calcifications again seen in an unchanged configuration. The bilateral hila are within normal limits. Minimal opacity at the right heart border likely represents crowding of normal bronchovascular structures. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no focal lung consolidation. Again seen is a right mid lung calcified granuloma. There are likely trace bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
