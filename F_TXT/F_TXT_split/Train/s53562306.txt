An endotracheal tube terminates 2.3 cm above the carina and an orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, with tip terminating within the gastric fundus. Low lung volumes and patient's rotated position accentuates the cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours. An area of patchy opacity is seen in the left lung base and likely represents atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
