The patient is markedly rotated limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. However, the heart does appear mildly enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Lungs appear relatively well inflated with streaky opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large effusions or pneumothoraces. Bilateral shoulder replacements.
