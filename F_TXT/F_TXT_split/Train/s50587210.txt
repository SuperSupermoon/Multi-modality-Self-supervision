Single upright portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, with no evidence of pneumothorax, large pleural effusion, or overt pulmonary edema. Low lung volumes accentuate the bilateral pulmonary vasculature, with hazy opacity about the infrahilar right lung, possibly due to aspiration or infection. No acute osseous injury is detected. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Calcifications are noted in the aortic arch.
