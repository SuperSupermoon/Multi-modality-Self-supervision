As before, there is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device whose leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. The right ventricular lead extends somewhat further into the ventricle than before. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The lungs appear hyperinflated. There is patchy new left basilar opacification, suggesting atelectasis with a possible accompanying small pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The bones appear demineralized. Degenerative changes are similar at each shoulder with periarticular calcifications that may represent hydroxyapatite deposition.
