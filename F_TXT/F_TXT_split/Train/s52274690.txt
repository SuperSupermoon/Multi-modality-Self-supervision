In comparison to the prior radiograph from earlier today, a left pleural catheter has been placed with marked decrease in size left pneumothorax with only a small apical pneumothorax remaining. The lung bases are slightly better aerated bilaterally. Decrease left perihilar opacification, potentially representing improving re-expansion edema in this patient with recent history of large volume thoracentesis. Moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. No other relevant change.
