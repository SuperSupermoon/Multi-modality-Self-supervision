Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There are pleural effusions, left side worse than right. The effusions have decreased in size since the previous study. There is increased density at the left hilar region which may be due to tumor or persistent pulmonary interstitial edema which appears stable. There is a left-sided pacemaker with lead tips in the right atrium and right ventricle. Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are seen. There is some widening of the AC joint, which may be postoperative. There is a left IJ central venous line with the distal lead tip in the mid SVC.
