AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 12 hours earlier during the same day. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position terminating some 4 cm above the level of the carina. Right-sided internal jugular approach central venous line as before reaches into the upper portion of the right atrium. The heart contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is less prominent than on previous examination, but basal diffuse haze is suggestive of pleural effusions layering in the posterior compartment of the pleural spaces in this patient in marked recumbent position. No evidence of new discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.
