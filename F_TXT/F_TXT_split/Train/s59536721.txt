As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and all monitoring and support devices have been removed. The lung volumes remain low. There are unchanged bilateral pleural effusions with moderate cardiomegaly and signs of mild fluid overload. The pre-existing opacity at the right lung apex is less well seen than on the previous image, given the head position of the patient.
