Heart size is normal. The aorta is diffusely calcified. A small hiatal hernia is again noted. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are slightly hyperinflated. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is relatively unchanged, and could reflect a trace right pleural effusion or pleural thickening. No focal consolidation, left pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Minimal scarring is noted in the lung apices. Extensive fusion hardware within the thoracolumbar spine is noted. Multiple sutures are seen within the right lateral abdomen.
