The ET tube is 8.5 cm above the carina. Right-sided chest tube is again visualized. There is severe subcutaneous emphysema, similar in extent to prior. Lucency is seen above the hemidiaphragm on the right, suggesting an element of inferior pneumothorax and at the left heart border with the deep sulcus sign on the left, again suggesting an inferior pneumothorax on the left. The overall appearance is similar to the film from 10 hours prior.
