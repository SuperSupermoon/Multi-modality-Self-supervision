Heterogeneous consolidation in the left lower lung zone which worsened between 3 a.m. and 18:___ yesterday is more pronounced today. The focal distribution suggests pneumonia, perhaps nosocomial bacterial infection. Mild interstitial edema elsewhere is stable. The extent of consolidation in the right lower lung attributed to worsening atelectasis is unchanged. Heart size is normal. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial. ET tube in standard position.
