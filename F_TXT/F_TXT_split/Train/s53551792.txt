There is complete opacification at the left lung base obscuring the left costophrenic angle, which is new from the prior study. A small left pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on this single AP view. The right lung is relatively clear. No pneumothorax is detected. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated due to opacification of the left lung base. The mediastinum appears prominent compared to the most recent prior study, which is in part related to technique; however, there is indistinctness at the aortic knob for which further evaluation with chest CTA is warranted.
