Compared with ___ at 18:28, a right-sided subclavian line is in place, tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Inspiratory volumes are now lower, with atelectasis or other patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region. The possibility of an early pneumonic infiltrate in this location cannot be excluded. There is probably also minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. No frank consolidation is identified. The mid and upper zones of both lungs are clear. No effusion.
