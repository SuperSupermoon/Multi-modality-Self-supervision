As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, predominantly reflecting moderate pulmonary edema, have not substantially changed. No interstitial component has developed but a small retrocardiac atelectasis has newly occurred. No larger pleural effusions. The patient has received a new left-sided hemodialysis catheter. The tip projects over the upper SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
