The patient is status post recent right upper lobe resection. Small-to-moderate right apicolateral pneumothorax is again demonstrated and has minimally decreased in size. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema in right chest wall is also slightly better. Right chest tube is unchanged in position, and postoperative alterations of the right mediastinal and hilar regions appear unchanged allowing for positional differences between the studies. Minimal atelectasis is present at the lung bases, left greater than right, and there are also apparent small pleural effusions.
