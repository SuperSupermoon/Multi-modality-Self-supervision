As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects relatively high above the carina, with a distance of approximately 6 cm. The tube could be advanced by 2-3 cm. There is unchanged evidence of basilar atelectasis as well as of bilateral perihilar parenchymal opacities that could reflect both centralized pulmonary edema or a status post aspiration. No other changes are visualized. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
