Right-sided IJ central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC/ cavoatrial junction. Enteric tube courses below the level the diaphragm, out of the field of view peer would appears to be a temperature probe overlies the chest to the left of midline terminating distal the level the diaphragm. The endotracheal tube is not optimally seen but may terminate approximately 3.6 cm above the level of the carina. There are low lung volumes. There is extensive right sided pulmonary opacity, particularly in the perihilar region, which may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema and/or infection. Pulmonary hemorrhage or severe aspiration would also be in the differential diagnosis. Patchy left apical opacity is also seen. No pleural effusion is seen. No large pleural effusion is seen although trace pleural effusion be difficult to exclude.
