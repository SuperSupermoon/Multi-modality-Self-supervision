An NG tube is seen coursing over the midline of the chest, with tip and side port below the level of the diaphragm, overlying the gastric fundus. Note is made of multiple dilated loops of small bowel in the left mid/upper abdomen, also demonstrated on a abdominal CT obtained earlier the same day. No free air seen beneath the diaphragm. The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. There is mild vascular plethora, likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Mild cardiomegaly is likely accentuated due to low lung volumes and patient positioning. The aorta is tortuous. Biapical pleural thickening and parenchymal scarring is seen. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
