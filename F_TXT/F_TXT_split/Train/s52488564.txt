AP portable upright view of the chest. Lung volumes are low limiting evaluation. The heart remains moderately enlarged with curvilinear calcification projecting over the heart compatible with mitral annular calcification. There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The lungs appear clear without focal consolidation, large effusion or pneumothorax. No convincing signs of edema or congestion. Atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob again noted. The bony structures appear intact.
