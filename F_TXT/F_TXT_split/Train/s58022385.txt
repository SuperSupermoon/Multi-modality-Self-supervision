Portable semi erect chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of an endotracheal tube, its tip which projects approximately 4 cm above the level of the carina in appropriate position. An enteric tube descends the thorax and uncomplicated course, its tip which terminates the low level of the diaphragm. Images are poorly penetrated and exact location of the tip is difficult to ascertain. There remains cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema with vascular engorgement. Probable small pleural effusions are noted. There is no pneumothorax. Widened mediastinum is likely due to a combination of vascular engorgement and mediastinal fat deposition.
