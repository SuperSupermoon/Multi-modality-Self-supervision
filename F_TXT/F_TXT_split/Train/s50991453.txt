Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac and mediastinal silhouette which is moderately enlarged. There right-sided hydropneumothorax appears decreased as compared to the prior study. Increased right base opacity may in part be due to low lung volumes versus worsening right-sided consolidation. Evidence of pneumoperitoneum is re- demonstrated. Mild left base atelectasis with possible pleural effusion. Right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is noted. Dense contrast is seen in the left splenic flexure.
