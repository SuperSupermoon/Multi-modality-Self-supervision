There has been interval placement of a left chest tube with tip projecting towards the left apex. Subcutaneous emphysema within the left chest wall is new. There has been slight interval improvement in aeration of the left upper lung field with persistently large left pleural effusion. Left basilar opacification is compatible with atelectasis. The right lung is grossly clear though the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. Deformity within the ribs bilaterally is compatible old fractures. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged.
