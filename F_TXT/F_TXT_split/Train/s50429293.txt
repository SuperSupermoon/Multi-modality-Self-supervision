In comparison with study of ___, on the semi-erect portable AP image, there is increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette. Minimal fullness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure, though the difference may merely be an indication of change in position. Similarly, there is increasing prominence of the mediastinum, though it is difficult to determine whether this merely reflects the AP supine position. No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. What appears to be a metallic clip is projected over the left apical region.
