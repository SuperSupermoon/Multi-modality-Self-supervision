An ET tube terminates approximately 3.1 cm above the carina in grossly appropriate location. An enteric tube is identified, with distal tip projecting below the lower limits of the radiograph, with the majority of the distal part coiling and projecting over the left upper abdomen, likely within the stomach. There is probable background hyperinflation/COPD. There is at least mild cardiomegaly, with enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There are diffuse bilateral airspace opacities with a central predominance, along with interlobular septal thickening, consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion and moderately severe CHF. Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, however developing infection would be difficult to exclude. There is likely a small left pleural effusion. There is no right gross pleural effusion. No pneumothorax detected. Punctate density overlying the left neck raises the question of a small focus of left carotid artery calcification.
