Portable AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates no focal opacity convincing for pneumonia. Streaky peribronchiolar opacities at the bases may reflect atelectasis or alternatively possibly atypical pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Left hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated.
