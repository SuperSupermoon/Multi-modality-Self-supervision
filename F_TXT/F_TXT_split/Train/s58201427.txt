CHEST, 1 VW Compared with earlier the same day, the Dobbhoff tube has been replaced. The radiopaque tip now lies in the region of the gastric fundus and GE junction. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Please note that multiple leads and tubes overlie the neck and superior mediastinum, which are of unknown etiology or significance.
