A single portable AP supine view of the chest was obtained. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the proximal right atrium. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Again seen are diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities in a predominantly nodular pattern with increased background haziness, probably representing superimposed edema. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are new. No pneumothorax.
