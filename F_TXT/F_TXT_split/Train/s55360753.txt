Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier at 8:20 a.m. The right subclavian line tip is at the level of low SVC. The ET tube tip is 7.8 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach and should be further advanced. Right lower lung atelectasis is redemonstrated, grossly unchanged since the prior study. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
