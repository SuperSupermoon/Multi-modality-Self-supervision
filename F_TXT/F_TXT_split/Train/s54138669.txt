A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of an enteric tube, which terminates within the stomach. A left PICC again terminates in the low SVC. There has been interval removal of the right chest pigtail catheter. The bilateral lung apices are incompletely imaged, but the exam appears grossly unchanged, with a right pleural thickening and possible effusion with associated atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains mildly enlarged. There is no focal consolidation. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
