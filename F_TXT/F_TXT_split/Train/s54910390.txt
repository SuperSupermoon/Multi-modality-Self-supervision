A supine portable chest radiograph is oblique such that the heart obscures the right medial lung field. There appears to be improved clarity at the right lung base compared to a film from much earlier the same date, which was semi-upright. There is still some partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. This consolidation could be either atelectasis or pneumonia, though the former appears more likely. Large cardiac silhouette is unchanged and positioning of supporting lines and tubes including endotracheal tube, right IJ central venous catheter and a right-sided midline are unchanged.
