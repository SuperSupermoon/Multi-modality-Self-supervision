As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3.5 cm above the carina. The patient also has received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not visualized on the image. The lung volumes continue to be low, with areas of atelectasis at both lung bases. The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Gas-filled intestinal structures between the liver and the right abdominal wall. An apparent increase in radiodensity located in the right upper lobe is likely atelectatic, but should be closely monitored to exclude the possibility of early pneumonia.
