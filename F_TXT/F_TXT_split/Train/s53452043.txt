In comparison with study of ___, there has been a substantial decrease in the amount of pleural fluid following placement of a chest tube and pleural drain. Some residual fluid persists. Small pneumothorax is seen in the apical region. There is prominence of the cardiac silhouette with mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification most likely represents atelectasis and effusion. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
