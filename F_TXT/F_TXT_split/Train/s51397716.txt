Heart is larger, pulmonary hilar and mediastinal vessels are more engorged, but there is no pulmonary edema. Pleural effusion is small if any. No pneumothorax. Tip of the ET tube is at the level of the sternal notch, in standard position approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view but would need to be advanced at least 5 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach.
