AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lung volumes are quite low. Cardiac silhouette is moderately to severely enlarged though exaggerated by low lung volumes due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. Left pleural effusion is moderate, right small if any. Greater opacification at the base of the left lung could be atelectasis or pneumonia. There is no such focal abnormality on the right but mild interstitial abnormality present generally could be edema, although there is no pulmonary or mediastinal vascular engorgement. Interstitial lung disease should be considered, as well as left lower lobe pneumonia.
