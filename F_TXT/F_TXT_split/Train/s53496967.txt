Comparison is made with prior study performed one hour earlier. Opacity in the right lower hemithorax is grossly unchanged consistent with right lower lobe collapse and atelectasis in the right middle lobe. Shifting of the cardiomediastinum towards the right is unchanged. Left lower lobe opacities have increased consistent with worsening atelectasis. Superimposed infection/aspiration in this area cannot be excluded. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
