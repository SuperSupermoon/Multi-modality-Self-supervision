Large area of opacity projecting over the upper and mid right hemithorax corresponds to large mass seen on preceding chest CT. Spiculated opacity measuring approximately 1.9 cm is seen in the left perihilar region/left mid lung worrisome for metastatic disease. Additional nodular opacities in the bilateral upper lobes are better assessed on CT. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.
