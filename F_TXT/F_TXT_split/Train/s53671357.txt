There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax. No contralateral shift of the mediastinal structures is demonstrated indicating that this is compatible with left lung collapse. A few air bronchograms are noted in the left lung. Within the right lung, there appears to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion without focal consolidation. The right lung is hyperinflated with probable emphysematous changes. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen on the right. There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures with multiple compression deformities noted in the imaged thoracic spine of indeterminate age.
