Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. Right basilar pleural pigtail catheter remains in place with a small residual effusion. There is improving aeration in both lungs with resolving interstitial and perihilar edema. Patchy opacity at the right base likely reflects atelectasis. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No obvious pneumothorax.
