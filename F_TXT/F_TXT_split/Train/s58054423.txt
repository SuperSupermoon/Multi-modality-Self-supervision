Severe cardiomegaly is chronic, but there is no pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion. Opacification at the right lung base could be atelectasis, especially since it has worsened following tracheal extubation. Lateral view would be helpful in excluding pneumonia. Transvenous right atrial right ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements and a right jugular line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
