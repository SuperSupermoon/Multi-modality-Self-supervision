No previous images. There is extensive opacification in the right mid zone with prominence of right paratracheal tissues. This would be consistent with a large mass and hilar adenopathy. Areas of less opacity are seen in the lower zone. There is some apparent shift of the mediastinum to the right, though this may merely reflect some obliquity due to patient. CT would be necessary to properly characterize the pathologic process in the right lung. The left lung is essentially clear.
