The new OG tube terminates in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced approximately 10 cm to position all of the sideholes in the stomach. Lungs are hyperinflated, but clear without effusion or consolidation. Heart, mediastinum, hila, and pleural surfaces are normal. Old healed left rib fractures are unchanged. The endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina and should not be withdrawn any further. The caliber of the endotracheal ET cuff exceeds that of the native trachea.
