As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improvement with reduction of the bilateral parenchymal opacities. However, there is still evidence of moderate fluid overload, cardiomegaly, and likely a small left pleural effusion. The presence of an additional, aspiration related change at the right lung base cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position.
