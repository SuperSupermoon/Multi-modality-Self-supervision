There has been interval placement of the bilateral pigtail catheters with interval decrease in bilateral effusions. There are patchy areas of alveolar infiltrate in the mid lungs bilaterally with mild pulmonary vascular re-distribution and ill-defined vascularity compatible with fluid overload. An underlying infectious infiltrate in these regions cannot be excluded. The endovascular stent extending from the distal aortic arch to the abdominal aorta is unchanged in appearance. There is no pneumothorax.
