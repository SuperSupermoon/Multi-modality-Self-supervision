As before, a right Port-A-Cath ends in the low SVC. Linear lucency along the left heart border seen on the prior radiograph from earlier today is less conspicuous on the present study. There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis, not significantly changed. A small left pleural effusion is not excluded. There is no right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinal contours are normal.
