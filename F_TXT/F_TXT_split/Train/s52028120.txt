As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The right PICC line is in unchanged position. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant. There is moderate elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with potential small-to-moderate atelectasis at the right lung base. Presence of a minimal right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
