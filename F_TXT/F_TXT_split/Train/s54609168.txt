There has been interval repositioning of the nasogastric tube, which now terminates in the stomach. All other support devices, including an ET tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, mediastinal drains and left chest tube are unchanged in position. Unchanged bandlike opacities at the right mid to lung zones are most likely due to atelectasis. Heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
