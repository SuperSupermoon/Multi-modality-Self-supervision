No previous images. There is substantial opacification in the right hemithorax with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm and a relatively small amount of aerated lung in the upper zone. No definite displacement of mediastinal contents, suggesting that this represents large pleural effusion with compensatory volume loss. In the appropriate clinical setting, however, it would be impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia. No evidence of appreciable pulmonary vascular congestion. Mild atelectatic changes at the left base. Left subclavian pacer is in place with leads extending to the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle.
