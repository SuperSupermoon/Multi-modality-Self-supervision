There has been interval placement of a tracheostomy tube. There are unusual streaky linear opacities on either side of the trachea with widening of the right paratracheal stripe. This is concerning for injury that occurred during the tracheostomy placement. This finding was immediately called to the covering clinician by Dr. ___ at the time of image interpretation at 16:45. The PICC line, moderately enlarged heart, and bilateral lower lobe infiltrates/volume loss are again seen.
