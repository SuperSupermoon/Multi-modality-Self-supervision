A left-sided pacemaker projects leads into the right atrium and ventricle. The heart is mildly enlarged. The hilar and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Central pulmonary vascular prominence appears minimally changed, though, in combination with lower lung volumes, likely represents overall improvement. There is no longer any appreciable edema. There is no pneumothorax. A small left pleural effusion is unchanged. A previously seen a very large hiatal hernia is not easily seen on the current study, due to lack of intraluminal gas.
