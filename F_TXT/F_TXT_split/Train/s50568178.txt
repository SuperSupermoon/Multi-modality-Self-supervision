A left-sided HD line now terminates in the mid SVC and left PICC line terminates in the upper-to-mid SVC. Endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina. An enteric tube terminates in the gastric fundus. A right central venous catheter has been removed. Lower lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular structures. Heterogenous opacity of the left lung base is insufficiently evaluated due to overlying external devices. Mild atelectasis of the right lung base is essentially unchanged. No definite pneumothorax.
