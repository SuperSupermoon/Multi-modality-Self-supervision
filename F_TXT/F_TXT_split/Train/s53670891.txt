AP portable upright view of the chest. There is a large right pneumothorax with complete collapse of the right lung. No shift of midline structures to the left to suggest a tension component. No pleural effusion. Suture material at the left lung apex suggests prior surgical resection. Left lung is otherwise unremarkable. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. Bony structures are intact.
