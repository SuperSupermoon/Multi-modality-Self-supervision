In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1.5 hours prior, no significant changes are appreciated. An NG tube passes into the stomach and outside the field of view. Previously identified mid left lung opacity is better appreciated. Retrocardiac and right lower lung opacities are essentially unchanged. Support lines and tubes are otherwise unchanged in position, with a right-sided PICC that terminates more proximally than is standard practice near the confluence of the right subclavian and right brachiocephalic veins.
