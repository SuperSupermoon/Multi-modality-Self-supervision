The patient is status post sternotomy. The heart is enlarged, although the cardiac silhouette is not optimally assessed due to superimposed diffuse pulmonary opacification suggesting moderate pulmonary edema. A pleural effusion of small-to-moderate size is suspected on the right side. Hazy opacification of the left lung base is indeterminate but potentially reflects an effusion in part. There is apparently an opacity with air bronchograms in the retrocardiac region. The lung volumes are low.
