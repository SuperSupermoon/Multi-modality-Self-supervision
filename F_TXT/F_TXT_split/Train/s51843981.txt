AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study dated ___. During the interval, the right-sided basal chest tube has been removed. Similar as before, very poor inspirational effort with high positioned diaphragms precluding analysis of lung bases. Linear atelectasis suggestive of plate atelectasis similar as before. No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen and no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.
