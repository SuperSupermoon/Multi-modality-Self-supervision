Low lung volumes are present. Heart size appears mildly enlarged, and likely accentuated due to low lung volumes. Mediastinal contour is unchanged with mild atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes but no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Atelectatic changes are noted at the lung bases. Diffusely sclerotic appearance of the imaged osseous structures is compatible with known metastatic disease.
