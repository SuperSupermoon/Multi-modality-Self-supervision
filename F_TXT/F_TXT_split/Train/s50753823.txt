An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. Orogastric tube enters the proximal stomach and terminates beyond the field of view. Lung volumes are low. Right infrahilar, right basilar and left retrocardiac opacities most likely represent atelectasis, less likely infection. There is a moderate-sized left pleural effusion. No large effusion on the right. There is no central vascular congestion or overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Heart size is difficult to assess in the setting of left pleural effusion, though likely moderately enlarged. There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta.
