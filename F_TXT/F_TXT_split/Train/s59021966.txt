AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Right chest tube is in place. Loculated right pleural effusion involving both medial and lateral as well as apical and basal aspect of the right pleural space is unchanged with slight increase in the medial component but potentially may be related to different position of the patient. Left pleural effusion is unchanged, moderate. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen on the current study on the right. Minimal pneumothorax on the left cannot be excluded although might represent summation of shadows, attention on the subsequent studies recommended. Multiple calcified pulmonary nodules are re-demonstrated.
