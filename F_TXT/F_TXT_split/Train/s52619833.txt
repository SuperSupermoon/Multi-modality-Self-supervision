As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube, the bilateral chest tubes and the Swan-Ganz catheter are in unchanged position. The pre-existing right pneumothorax at the apex is no longer visible. There are minimally increasing vascular diameters and interstitial markings, potentially reflecting mild fluid overload. This is supported by a slightly increase in size of the cardiac silhouette. All these changes, however, could also lead to a change in respiratory pressure. Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis. Unchanged absence of larger pleural effusions.
