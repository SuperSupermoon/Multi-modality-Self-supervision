Again seen is moderate right-sided pneumothorax that is not substantially changed in size compared to the study from the prior day. Right-sided pigtail catheter, tracheostomy tube, right-sided PICC line, and feeding tube are unchanged. There is an increased left-sided effusion that is layering posteriorly. There continues to be retrocardiac opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. There is increased alveolar infiltrate bilaterally likely representing CHF.
