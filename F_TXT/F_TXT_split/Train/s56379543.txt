Endotracheal tube terminates 2.3 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. Subtle left base opacity may be due to atelectasis, given mild elevation the adjacent left hemidiaphragm versus aspiration, although does not appear increased as compared to the prior study. Subtle linear streaky right mid lung opacity is more conspicuous than on the prior study and most likely represents atelectasis. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
