The endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina. No change in the left subclavian PICC line and NG tube. Previously described left retrocardiac opacity has improved. Small left pleural effusion is likely unchanged, despite differences in patient positioning. The lungs are otherwise clear without pneumothorax or focal consolidation.
