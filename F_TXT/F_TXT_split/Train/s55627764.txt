Right PICC tip terminates in the upper SVC. Tracheostomy tube remains in unchanged standard position. Right-sided pacer device is noted with single lead terminating in the right ventricle. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, with tortuosity of thoracic aorta again noted. Patchy opacity within the left lung base appears new compared to the prior exam, and could reflect pneumonia or aspiration. Small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis in the right lung base and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm appear relatively similar. Assessment for left-sided pleural effusion is limited as the left costophrenic angle is not completely included in the exam, but no large effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax or evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
