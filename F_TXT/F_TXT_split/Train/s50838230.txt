There is a tunneled dialysis catheter ending in the cavoatrial junction. The tip of the right-sided PICC appears to be obscured by the overlying catheter. The tracheostomy tube is in appropriate position. In the setting of poor inspiratory effort, there does appear to be a slight interval increase in the right middle and lower lobe consolidations. No new focal opacities are seen. The right-sided pleural effusion appears to be stable with a small residual effusion remaining. There is no visible pneumothorax.
