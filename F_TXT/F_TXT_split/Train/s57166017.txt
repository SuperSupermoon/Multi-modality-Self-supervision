AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___ obtained at 00:05. Heart size is enlarged, to at least moderate extent. The widespread parenchymal consolidations are demonstrated, corresponding to the abnormality seen on the CT torso obtained the same day earlier. As compared to prior radiograph, the appearance of the lung has slightly progressed, that might be consistent with interval development of mild interstitial pulmonary edema. The combination of infectious process and pulmonary edema is the most likely explanation, associated with small amount of bilateral pleural effusion. Post-sternotomy wires in the patient after CABG appear unchanged.
