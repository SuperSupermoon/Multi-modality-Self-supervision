Single AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Bibasilar atelectasis is present and the left lung base is not well visualized, possibly due to atelectasis and portable technique, however an underlying infectious process cannot be completely excluded. There is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is present. Multilevel spinal fusion surgical hardware is identified in the thoracolumbar spine.
