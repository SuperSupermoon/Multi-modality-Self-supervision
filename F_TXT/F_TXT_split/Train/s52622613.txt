Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged since the prior study, but there is substantial interval development of perihilar opacities and bibasal consolidations as well as relatively low lung volumes. These findings are concerning for multifocal infection and less likely pulmonary edema. Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Current study reveals no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum within the limitations of this portable AP radiograph.
