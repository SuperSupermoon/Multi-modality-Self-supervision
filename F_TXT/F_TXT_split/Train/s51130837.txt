As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the known right pneumothorax has increased. The collapsed lung is smaller than it was on the previous images. The basal pleural effusion on the right is constant. Constant size of the cardiac silhouette. However, lower lung volumes, there is more crowding of vascular structures at the left lung base. No left pleural effusion.
