There are patchy ill-defined opacities in the right hemithorax, which were largely seen on the prior CXR. However, the right lung base opacity has worsened over the past 5 hours. These findings are compatible with multifocal pneumonia. Left layering pleural effusion appears to have improved, but this may partially be due to change in positioning. No pneumothorax. Mediastinum appears wide, but is stable. Heart size is top normal. No acute osseous abnormalities. The endotracheal tube, right PICC line, enteric tube are unchanged in position. Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
