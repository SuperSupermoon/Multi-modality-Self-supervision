In comparison with the study of ___, there is an placement of a nasogastric tube that extends only to about the level of the EG junction. It should be pushed forward about 8-10 cm for more optimal positioning. Streaks of atelectasis are again seen at the left base. The new right subclavian PICC line tip is probably in the upper right atrium. It could be pulled back approximately 2 cm if the desired position is at or just above the cavoatrial junction.
