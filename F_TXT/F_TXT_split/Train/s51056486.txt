A tracheostomy tube is seen in standard position. The right PICC is seen terminating in the mid SVC. A left internal jugular line is seen in terminating at the origin of the SVC. A feeding tube is seen with its tip in the stomach and should be advanced approximately 5 cm so that all side ports are beyond the GE junction. The lung volumes are low and the previously seen bilateral airspace opacities consistent with pulmonary edema are largely unchanged from the prior study. There is persistent bibasilar atelectasis, which is minimally improved from prior study. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are grossly unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
