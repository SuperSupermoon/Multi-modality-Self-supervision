Circumferential right-sided pleural opacification appears similar to the previous study with chest tube remaining in place. Based on recent CTA of the chest of ___, this is due to a combination of pleural effusion and pleural thickening. No definite pneumothorax is visualized. Diffuse interstitial thickening throughout the right lung is similar to the prior radiograph and could reflect lymphangitic carcinomatosis, interstitial infection or asymmetrical edema. Known pulmonary nodules are more fully evaluated on the recent CT.
