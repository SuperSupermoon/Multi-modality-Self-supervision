AP portable upright view of the chest. Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted. There is a left IJ Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip again noted to enter the left pulmonary artery. The endotracheal tube is poorly visualized. A nasogastric tube extends inferiorly along the thoracic midline though the tip is excluded from view. Overlying EKG leads somewhat limit the assessment. There are bilateral pleural effusions which are similar to the prior exam. No large pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette stable. Bony structures intact.
