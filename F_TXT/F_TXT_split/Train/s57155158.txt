As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the known right pleural effusion and the associated right basal opacity is constant. Also constant are the peripheral mid lung right parenchymal opacities. The basal opacities are likely reflecting atelectasis, whereas the more apical peripheral opacities are consistent with pulmonary contusion. This is supported by the CT findings obtained on ___. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. Unchanged minimal left basal atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax.
