In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the nasogastric tube has been pushed forward so that the side port is well below the esophagogastric junction. There has been placement of a right IJ catheter that extends to about the level of the cavoatrial junction with no evidence of post procedure pneumothorax. Other monitoring and support devices are stable. Low lung volumes accentuate the prominence of the cardiac silhouette. Indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The left hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen and there is retrocardiac opacification, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural fluid.
