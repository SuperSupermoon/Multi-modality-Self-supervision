Endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carina. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right internal jugular central line unchanged with its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Lung volumes are slightly lower resulting in crowding of the vasculature. Overall, the mild edema is improving. Probable layering right effusion. No pneumothorax.
