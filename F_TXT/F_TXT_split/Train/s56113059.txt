A right basilar chest tube is noted, new in the interval. There has been no substantial interval change in the size of the large right pleural effusion with leftward shift of mediastinal structures and associated collapse of the right lung. Again noted is a small amount of residual aerated lung in the right upper lobe. Left lung remains grossly clear. Central venous catheter from an inferior approach terminates at the junction of the IVC and right atrium, unchanged. No pneumothorax is present. Right mastectomy and axillary clips are re- demonstrated.
