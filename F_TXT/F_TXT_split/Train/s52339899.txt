In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is continued opacification at the right base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm. This could reflect some combination of volume loss, pleural fluid, and superimposed consolidation. On the left, there is increased opacification at the base obscuring the hemidiaphragm and consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion.
