Portable supine view of the chest was reviewed. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs are well expanded without focal consolidation. Height loss in an upper thoracic vertebral body as well as multiple bilateral rib fractures are better assessed on outside hospital chest CT.
