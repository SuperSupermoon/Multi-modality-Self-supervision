Consolidation in the left lower lobe which developed several hr after left thoracentesis has improved substantially, and left pleural effusion is minimal if any. Perhaps the consolidation was due to unusually delayed re-expansion edema, or perhaps the patient had a large aspiration which is clearing. There is no pneumothorax. Right lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.
