There has been marked decrease in opacification of the left lower hemithorax corresponding to interval drainage of pleural effusion. Streaky remaining opacities are most suggestive of associated atelectasis. On the right, there is mild blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus and slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which is nonspecific but could be seen with a small subpulmonic effusion. Streaky medial right basilar opacities, not overlapping with the right cardiac border, are suggestive of minor atelectasis in the right lower lobe, which has increased somewhat. There is no pneumothorax.
