The patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates shortly below the thoracic inlet, approximately 5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube has been placed, but it terminates only slightly below the left hemidiaphragm, and its sidehole projects along the distal esophagus. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. The lungs appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
