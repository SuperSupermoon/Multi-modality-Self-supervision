There is no large right pneumothorax but there may be a growing postsurgical pneumatocele at the lateral margin of the right midlung. Right pleural effusion is small if any. Moderate Bibasilar atelectasis unchanged. Greater caliber of the pulmonary and mediastinal vessels suggests increased intravascular volume but heart is not enlarged and there is no edema. Severe subcutaneous emphysema in the right neck and chest wall has redistributed but is probably no larger.
