In comparison with the study of ___, the Dobbhoff tube has been removed and replaced with a nasogastric tube, which extends to the lower body or antrum of the stomach before coiling back on itself to lie in the mid to upper portion of the body of the stomach. Again there are relatively low lung volumes with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms and costophrenic angles, suggesting small pleural effusions with underlying atelectasis. Remainder the lung is clear and there is no evidence of vascular congestion.
