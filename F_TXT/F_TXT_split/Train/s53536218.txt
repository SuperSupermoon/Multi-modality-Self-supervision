Overlying trauma board limits evaluation. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube tip is within the stomach. Lung volumes are low. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Mild widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to supine positioning and low lung volumes. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. No displaced fractures are evident.
