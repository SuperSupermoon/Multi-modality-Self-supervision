As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube was removed. The left PICC line is in unchanged position. The extent and severity of the bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting multifocal pneumonia, has slightly increased. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
