In comparison with the study ___ ___, the nasogastric tube has been pushed forward so that the tip is in the mid to lower stomach and the side-port is definitely distal to the esophagogastric junction. The cardiac silhouette is unchanged. And there is some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. There has been substantial increase in opacification in the right mid and lower zones, which could be consistent with the clinical impression of worsening pneumonia. However, the hemidiaphragm is now all obscured, suggesting that some of this appearance could instead represent additional layering pleural effusion. Opacification at the left base is again seen, which could well represent another focus of pneumonia.
