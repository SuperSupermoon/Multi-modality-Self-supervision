AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 07:56 p.m. The current examination demonstrates overall unchanged appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette as well as bilateral pleural effusions. No definitive pneumopericardium demonstrated. The Port-A-Cath catheter tip terminates at the level of cavoatrial junction/right atrium. The intra-abdominal stenting is partially imaged. Left lung aeration is preserved.
