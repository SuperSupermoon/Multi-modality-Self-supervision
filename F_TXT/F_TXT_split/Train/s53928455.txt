Irregular opacities are present within both lungs, though left greater than right, findings suggestive of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is evident. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Thoracolumbar spinal hardware is incompletely evaluated. Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles is stable and likely reflects chronic pleural scarring.
