Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a large right apical bulla, compatible with findings on recent prior CT of the cervical spine. Relative left apical lucency is consistent with known paraseptal emphysema. The heart is not enlarged. Mild prominence of interstital markings could be secondary to crowding by bulla or could reflect an element of intertitial parenchymal change. Relative opacity in left mid- and lower zones may reflect atelectasis and accentuation by oblique positioning.
