Bilateral lung volumes are low. Since yestarday, bibasilar opacities probably from atelectasis have improved. The aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta is generally large, mildly calcified and unchanged in apperance. The heart size and hilar contours are normal. There are no new lung opacities of concern. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
