The right pigtail chest tube is again visualized. There is a small to moderate right apical and lateral pneumothorax that has increased in size compared to the study from the prior day. There is hazy infiltrate in both lower lungs with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm suggesting more focal infiltrate/effusion in this region.
