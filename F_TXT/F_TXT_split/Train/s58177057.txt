Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. There is retrocardiac opacity which could represent atelectasis or aspiration. In addition, there is subtle opacity obscuring the CP angle from the frontal view, which may represent tiny bilateral pleural effusions. A lateral view would aid in evaluation. The heart and mediastinal contours are normal. No signs of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. The bony structures are intact.
