Single frontal view of the chest. A metallic stent projects over the left heart border. Heart size is stable. Slight widening of the vascular pedicle, engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature, and mild perihilar haziness are consistent with new mild pulmonary edema. Lung volumes are low but there is no focal consolidation, substantial pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.
