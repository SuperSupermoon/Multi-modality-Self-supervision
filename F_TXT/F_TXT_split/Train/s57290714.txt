The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent prior study. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits allowing for low lung volumes. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
