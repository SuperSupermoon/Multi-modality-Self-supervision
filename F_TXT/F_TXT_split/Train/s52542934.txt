The lung volumes are low. There is mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. A mild interstitial abnormality suggests slight fluid overload. Patchy opacity with a shifting distribution lies within the right cardiophrenic angle, suggesting persistent minor atelectasis. The left costophrenic sulcus is excluded. However, there is no definite evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
