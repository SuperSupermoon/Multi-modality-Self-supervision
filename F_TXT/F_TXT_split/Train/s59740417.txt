The patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 5.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach although its sidehole marker lies near the gastroesophageal junction. Lung volumes are low with suspected volume loss at the right lung base. Bullous changes are present at the lung apices. Allowing for crowding at the lung bases associated with low lung volumes, lungs otherwise show no definite parenchymal abnormality. However, short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful to reassess.
