Study is limited due to poor technique and the patient's body habitus. Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed. There is an unchanged left-sided pacemaker. There is cardiomegaly. There are new opacities within the right perihilar region and left base. They may represent atelectasis; however, early infiltrate or aspiration is not excluded. There is mild pulmonary edema. There is poor evaluation of the left base.
