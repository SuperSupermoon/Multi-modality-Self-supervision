In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are stable. There are extremely low lung volumes and the image has been taken with a strong lordotic appearance. This enhances the size of the cardiac silhouette. There is continued pulmonary vascular congestion, though this may be less than on the previous study. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured. If this does not represent technical factors, this appearance would be consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
