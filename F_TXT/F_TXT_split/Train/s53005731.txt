Nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of a minimally distended stomach. In the setting of large right pleural effusion assessment of the right lung is difficult but I think there is a large consolidation in the lung, pneumonia until proved otherwise. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pulmonary edema in the left lung there is mild vascular engorgement. No pneumothorax.
