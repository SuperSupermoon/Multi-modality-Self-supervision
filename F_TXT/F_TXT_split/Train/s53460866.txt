Portable semi upright chest radiograph was obtained. Dobbhoff tube is seen curled in the upper esophagus with unchanged position of tracheostomy tube, left dual and right single-lumen central venous catheters. The lungs are low in volume with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis without pleural effusions with mild pulmonary edema unchanged. Cardiac enlargement is stable.
