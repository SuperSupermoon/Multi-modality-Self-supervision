Esophageal stent remains in place. Left PICC has been withdrawn or repositioned, now terminating in the proximal to mid superior vena cava. Right pigtail pleural catheter has a slightly more lateral location than on the prior radiograph. There is no visible pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Confluent opacity in the right lower lung medially corresponds to a known fluid collection on prior CT with adjacent lung parenchymal opacity. Band-like, linear opacities in the left mid and lower lung are suggestive of atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also noted.
