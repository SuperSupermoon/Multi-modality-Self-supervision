The newly inserted enteric tube traverses the diaphragm into the left upper quadrant and crosses over into the right upper quadrant where the tip is located, in the stomach. Otherwise, no significant interval change. The ETT tip remains approximately 7 cm above the carina at and again could be advanced an additional 4 cm to avoid inadvertant extubation. The right internal venous catheter tip ends in the mid SVC, unchanged. Severe bilateral pulmonary edema persists and is unchanged when accounting for redistribution, most compatible with ARDS in the setting of and essentially normal heart size and absence of pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
