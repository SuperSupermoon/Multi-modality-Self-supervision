Dual-lead right-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and overlying right base atelectasis. Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature suggests mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, which has increased slightly in the interval. Right base opacity may be due to combination of edema and atelectasis, although a consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded. No left-sided pleural effusion or focal consolidation is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are stable.
