In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval change. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in place with the sideport of the nasogastric tube at about the level of the esophagogastric junction. This should be pushed forward if possible for optimal positioning. No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion. Bilateral apical pleural scarring is again seen, as are several old healed rib fractures on the right.
