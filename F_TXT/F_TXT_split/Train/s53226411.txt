Heart size and mediastinum unremarkable. Right PICC line tip terminates at the level of mid SVC. Pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right atrium and right ventricle. Catheter is projecting over the left upper quadrant, its position and designation is unclear. There is also catheter projecting over the right lower lung, and most likely represents an external structure but correlation with patient's supporting devices is required.
