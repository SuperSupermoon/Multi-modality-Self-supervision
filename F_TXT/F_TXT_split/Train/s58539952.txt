The ETT terminates approximately 6.5 cm above the carina. There are bilateral PICC lines, the right terminating at the cavoatrial junction, and the left terminating in the distal SVC. There is an NG tube coursing below the diaphragm, however the tip is not visualized on this image. The bibasilar opacities have decreased, representing improving pleural effusions or may be due to more upright positioning. The degree of pulmonary edema, most evident in the right lung, has also improved. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is no pneumothorax.
