Compared with the prior film, no definite change is identified. Again seen is a stent which appears to traverse the expected site of the GE junction. The extreme inferolateral edge of the stent is excluded from the film. No pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or subdiaphragmatic air is identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is detected in either lung. Again noted is the left subclavian PICC line with tip over distal SVC. Note is made of scattered calcification in the thoracic aorta and bilateral carotid arteries.
