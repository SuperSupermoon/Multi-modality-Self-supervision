In comparison with the study of ___, there is some improved aeration at the left base with residual atelectatic changes. The hemidiaphragm is much more sharply seen at this time. Minimal atelectatic changes are seen on the right. Mild engorgement of pulmonary vessels suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Endotracheal tube tip position is unchanged.
