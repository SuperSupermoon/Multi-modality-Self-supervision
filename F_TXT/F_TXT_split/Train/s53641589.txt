Only mild pulmonary edema remains. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly has improved over the past several days. Transvenous right ventricular defibrillator lead unchanged in position, obscuring the tip of the right jugular line and beyond the mid SVC. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube can be traced only as far as the mid esophagus. Conceivably conventional radiographs would be more successful in localizing the tip. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax.
