Right-sided chest tube has been withdrawn and now overlies the right lower hemi thorax/upper abdomen. The right-sided hydro pneumothorax does not appear significantly changed given the presence of the chest tube. Left lung is grossly stable given that the left costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image.
