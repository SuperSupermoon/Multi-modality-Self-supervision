Tracheostomy tube tip is in standard position. Left PICC remains in unchanged position with the tip terminating at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. Cardiac and mediastinal contours remain similar with mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette again noted, and widening of the superior mediastinum re- demonstrated, attributable to underlying lymphadenopathy. Mild pulmonary edema is slightly improved in the interval but persists. Chain sutures are noted in the right hilar region with evidence of volume loss in the right lung, unchanged. Focal peripheral opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the minor fissure persists and appears more consolidated in the interval. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are noted, not substantially changed in the interval, with associated atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Percutaneous gastrostomy catheter is partially imaged.
