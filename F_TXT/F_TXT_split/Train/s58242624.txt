As compared to the previous radiograph, the external pacemaker lead that the patient has recently received is in unchanged position. Also unchanged is the left chest tube. The blunting of the left costophrenic sinus is less severe than on the previous image, this is likely reflecting a decrease in extent of pleural effusion. Mild cardiomegaly persists. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.
