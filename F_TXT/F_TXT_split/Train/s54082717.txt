1. There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which has its tip seen just at the level of the carina. Repositioning is recommended. The endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. There continues to be low lung volumes. Patchy airspace opacities at the medial right lung base, left peripheral lung and in the left base most likely reflect patchy atelectasis given interval changes from the prior study earlier today. The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to patient rotation on the current study. Results of this examination were conveyed by ___ to Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at 5:___ p.m.
