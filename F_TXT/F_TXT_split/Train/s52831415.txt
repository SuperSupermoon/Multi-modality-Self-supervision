A small region of peribronchial opacification at the base the left lung is probably atelectasis. Upper lungs are entirely clear. I would recommend conventional chest radiographs for better assessment of the lungs. Heart is normal size. Thoracic aorta unchanged in contour since ___ is tortuous, generally large and might be focally dilated in the ascending portion.
