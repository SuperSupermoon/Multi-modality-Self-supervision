The feeding tube tip still lies in the lower esophagus and little higher than it was since prior radiographs acquired one hour apart. I do not see evidence of the tube coiled in the proximal esophagus or hypopharynx. There are no other interval changes in the lungs. Bibasilar opacities likely from consolidation and/or atelectasis are unchanged.
