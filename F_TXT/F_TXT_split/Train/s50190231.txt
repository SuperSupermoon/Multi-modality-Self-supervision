Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the lower SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There are low lung volumes. Now mild pulmonary edema has improved. Small bilateral effusions larger on the left are probably improved. No other interval change from prior study.
