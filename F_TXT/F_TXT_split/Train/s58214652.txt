A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right central catheter with the tip in the mid SVC. The heart is top normal in size and the lung volumes are low. Multiple pulmonary nodules are better evaluated on recent CT chest. Fullness of mediastinal and upper lobe pulmonary vessels may be secondary to change in patient position and a more lordotic view. There is no large pleural effusion, and no pneumothorax.
