AP view of the chest. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Streaky opacities along the right medial lower hemithorax most likely represent atelectasis; however, early pneumonia cannot be ruled out in the correct clinical setting. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are intact.
