No previous images. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is engorgement of ill-defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with the clinical impression of congestive failure. Poor definition of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with bilateral effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases. No focal consolidation is appreciated.
