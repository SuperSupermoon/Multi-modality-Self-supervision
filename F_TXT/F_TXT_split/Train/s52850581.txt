Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Mild emphysematous changes are present without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Multiple bilateral rib fractures are noted, more so on the right left, better seen on the previous CT.
