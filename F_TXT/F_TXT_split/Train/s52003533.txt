As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The pre-existing parenchymal opacity in the retrocardiac lung areas is likely to be atelectatic, given the concomitant elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No other parenchymal abnormalities, except for the hyperlucencies in the lung apices, strongly indicative of extensive pulmonary emphysema. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged position of the monitoring and support devices.
