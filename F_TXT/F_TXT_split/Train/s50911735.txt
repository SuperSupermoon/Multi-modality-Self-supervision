As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved aeration of the lungs, notably in their apical parts. However, the pre-existing signs of pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate cardiomegaly are still clearly visible. Also visible are the areas of atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions and in the right mid lung. The monitoring and support devices are constant. No new parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
