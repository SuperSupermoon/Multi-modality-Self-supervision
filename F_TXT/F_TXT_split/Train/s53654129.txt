Heart remains enlarged. There is calcification in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. There is interstitial prominence which may reflect age-related changes or small airways disease. Overall, there is somewhat improved aeration at the right lung base where there are residual streaky opacities which may represent scarring or residual atelectasis. The previously described faint nodular opacity at the right base is not apparent on the current study. The left lung is grossly clear. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
