Exam is limited by marked patient rotation. With these limitations in mind, cardiomediastinal contours are grossly stable. New diffuse opacification of the right hemithorax could potentially represent a layering moderate-to-large right pleural effusion, but coexisting lung parenchymal disease is considered likely and attention to this area on a repeat non-rotated radiograph would be helpful. In the left hemithorax, there is persistent dense left retrocardiac opacification as well as a probable small left pleural effusion. There is no detectable pneumothorax.
