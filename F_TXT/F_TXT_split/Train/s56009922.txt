In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is a little overall change. Again fluid is filling part of the space where there was previous pneumothorax at the right base. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications are again seen. There could be some hazy opacification at the left base consistent with some layering effusion.
