The left heart border is obscured by a moderate left pleural effusion, which has slightly increased in size compared to the prior exam, with stable mild adjacent compressive atelectasis. There has been interval placement of a left-sided pigtail catheter, with the tip seen overlying the effusion. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. No focal consolidations concerning for infection are identified. The hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
