AP chest radiograph. Since the prior study, there has been interval increase in still small right apical pneumothorax. Minimal atelectasis in the right middle lobe is redemonstrated. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen on the left, but there is most likely present subcutaneous air again that might reflect the superimposed structures and the next radiograph should be obtained with attention to no superimposed structures projecting over the left upper chest.
