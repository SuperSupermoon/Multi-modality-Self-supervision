Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The patient is after tracheostomy placement with the tip of tracheostomy being 4.5 cm above the carina. There is a pacemaker in the left hemithorax with its leads terminating in the expected location of right atrium and right ventricle. The assessment of the cardiac silhouette demonstrates mild cardiomegaly. There is also presence of the mediastinal shift to the left, most likely due to left lower lobe atelectasis, partially imaged. Patient is in mild interstitial edema. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen as well. Infectious process in the lung bases cannot be entirely excluded. Followup after diuresis to assess the remaining opacities that might potentially worrisome for infection is recommended.
