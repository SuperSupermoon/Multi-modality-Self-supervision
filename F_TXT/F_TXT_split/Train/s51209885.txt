The patient is markedly rotated limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. However, given this limitation, the right hilar region is prominent raising concern for either prominent pulmonary arteries versus lymphadenopathy. The pulmonary edema has improved. Right hemidiaphragm is now elevated and there are streaky opacities at the right base likely reflecting atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
