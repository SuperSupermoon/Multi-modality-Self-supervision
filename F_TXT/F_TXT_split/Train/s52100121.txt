There has been slight interval retraction of a right-sided chest tube which now projects over the mid right lung field. The inferior chest tube projects over the lower lung. Right-sided subcutaneous emphysema persists. Small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Large known upper lobe consolidation on the right appears similar to the prior exam with persistent mild right basilar atelectasis. Mild plate-like atelectasis is seen at the left lung base; otherwise, the left lung is clear. There is no interval change in the appearance of the cardiac silhouette. Small right-sided pleural effusion is persistent. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
