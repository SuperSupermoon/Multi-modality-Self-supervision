Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates intact median sternotomy wires and interval removal of an enteric tube and right chest tube and, with minimal subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest wall. There is somewhat similar mild perihilar vascular congestion and stable moderate left pleural effusion and increased small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. Coarse calcifications along the aortic arch is unchanged. The upper lungs remain relatively well aerated. Previously seen tiny right apical pneumothorax is no longer appreciable.
