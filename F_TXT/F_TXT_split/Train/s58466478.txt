No previous images. The endotracheal tube measures approximately 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen. The right upper zone in the apical region is poorly visualized due to overlapping bony structures. This area should be closely assessed on subsequent images without bony overlap. There are several lines suggesting pleural lines in the right upper and mid zones. However, vessels appear to extend beyond these, suggesting that they represent skin folds.
