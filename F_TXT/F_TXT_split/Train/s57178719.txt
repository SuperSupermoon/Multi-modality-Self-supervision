There is a decrease in extent of the pre-existing small pleural effusion but a subtle basilar and apical lateral millimetric pneumothorax has appeared postprocedurally. No evidence of tension. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the left lung. Unchanged position of the fiducial marker in the right lung apex.
