Widening of the upper mediastinum is likely due to a combination of postoperative change and accentuation by apical lordotic projection. There remains a localized pneumomediastinum, likely postoperative in etiology. Within the lungs, patchy left retrocardiac opacity has slightly worsened, and may be due to atelectasis, aspiration, and less likely a developing focus of infection. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
