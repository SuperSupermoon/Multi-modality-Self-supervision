New tubular opacity is extending laterally and superiorly from the left hilus and upper pole of the right hilus suggest mucoid impaction. Peribronchial infiltration in both lower lungs is relatively mild, but has worsened. Heart size is normal, unchanged and there is no mediastinal venous engorgement or appreciable pleural effusion, nevertheless there are new septal lines at both lung bases. If this is pulmonary edema I am at a loss to explain why unless the patient has been over hydrated. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC.
