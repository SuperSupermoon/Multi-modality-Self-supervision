Very small right apical pneumothorax minimally larger compared to 15:15. Region of consolidation in the right lower lobe is presumably ablation artifact and/or bleeding. Pleural effusion is small if any. Lung volumes remain quite low do largely due moderate left basal atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged. Right subclavian infusion port ends in the upper SVC.
