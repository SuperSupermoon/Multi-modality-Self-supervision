As compared to the previous radiograph, tracheostomy tube and the right PICC line are in unchanged position. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Improved ventilation of the lungs, without evidence of pneumonia or other pathologic parenchymal process. A minimal increase in radiodensity at the right lung base is likely caused by a combination of atelectasis and rightward patient rotation. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
