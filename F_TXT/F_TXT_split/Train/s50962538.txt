Heart size is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly congested with mild pulmonary edema. Bilateral effusions are larger and the right lower lobe is probably collapsed. Consolidation in the right upper lung is similar to 2 days ago. Consolidation of the left lung has progressed significantly from 2 days ago an is now diffuse and overall slightly worse than the right side. No pneumothorax. Lines and tubes: ET tube tip is approximately 2.4 cm above the carina. Left IJ venous line tip is in the lower SVC. NG tube and esophageal probe positions and tip locations are not significantly changed.
