AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved, though mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement persist. Greater opacification over the left hemithorax is due in part to overlying soft tissue, but perhaps to posteriorly collected pleural effusion as well. No pneumothorax. ET tube tip is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 6 cm from the carina. It could be advanced 2 cm for more secure seating. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
