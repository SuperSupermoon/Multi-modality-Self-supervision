In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been removed. Nasogastric tube again extends well into the stomach. There is some residual increased opacification at the left base that is less prominent than on the previous study. This would be consistent with the clinical impression of aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Prominence of interstitial markings could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Of incidental note is a cervical fusion device in place.
