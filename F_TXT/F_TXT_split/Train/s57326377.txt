1. There has been a prior median sternotomy. Heart is mildly enlarged despite portable technique. There is some prominence of both hilar regions, which could reflect prominent pulmonary arteries, raising the possibility of pulmonary arterial hypertension or lymphadenopathy. Comparison to prior studies would be helpful to assess for interval change and clinical correlation would also be advised. The left subclavian PICC line courses across midline and appears to have its tip abutting the lateral border of the proximal superior vena cava. A pullback of 2-3 cm would place the tip in a more central portion of the vessel. Streaky opacities at both lung bases likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. There is likely a layering left effusion with more focal patchy opacity at the left base which could reflect compressive atelectasis, although superimposed infectious process should also be considered. No evidence of pneumothorax.
