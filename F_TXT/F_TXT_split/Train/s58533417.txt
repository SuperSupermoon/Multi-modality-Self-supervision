AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. The patient is still intubated, the ETT terminate in the trachea some 5 cm above the level of the carina. The heart appears markedly enlarged. This is possibly accentuated by the AP technique and the markedly recumbent position of the patient. The pulmonary vasculature is very hazy and there exist bilateral mostly centrally located parenchymal infiltrates, most likely representing acute pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax can be seen. No other indwelling tubes are seen. In comparison with the next preceding chest examination of ___, only mild-to-moderate cardiac enlargement exists at that time, and there were no signs of acute pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion.
