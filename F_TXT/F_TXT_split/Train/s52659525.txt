Newly placed ET tube terminates at the level of the clavicles, roughly 4 cm above the carina. The patient has had prior median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement. The Swan-Ganz catheter terminates at the level of the main pulmonary artery. Bilateral chest tubes are in place. There is no pneumothorax.
