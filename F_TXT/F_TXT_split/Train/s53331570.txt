AP chest compared to ___: Previous severe pulmonary edema has improved, but there is still a large right pleural effusion and possibility of pneumonia in both lower lobes and in the axillary region of the right upper lobe all of which, alternatively could be due to residual edema, atelectasis and overlying effusion. If feasible, conventional radiographs might be easier to interpret. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is longstanding. There is no mediastinal vascular engorgement to suggest that there is associated elevation of central venous pressure. No pneumothorax.
