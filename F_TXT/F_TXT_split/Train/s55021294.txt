There is a persistent large left-sided pleural effusion although with overall volume loss and mild leftward shift of mediastinal and cardiac structures. Overall quantity of fluid is probably fairly similar and, given overall volume loss, extensive atelectasis of the left lower lobe and lingula is suspected. Right lung remains clear. There is no pleural effusion. Heart is probably enlarged but its contours are partly obscured. Aortic arch is calcified.
