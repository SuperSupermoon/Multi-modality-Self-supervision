AP chest compared to ___: Yesterday's mild pulmonary edema has improved. There is more consolidation at the base of the left lung which is most commonly atelectasis but could be pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion is larger, presumably related to the residual of previous heart failure. The heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Mediastinum is normal. There is no pneumothorax. Mitral annulus is extremely heavily calcified, a condition which predisposes to mitral regurgitation.
