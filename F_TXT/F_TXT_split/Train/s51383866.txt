There is improved aeration of the left upper lobe from ___. Increased retrocardiac opacification and hazy opacification at the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a pleural effusion with worsening left lower lobe atelectasis. A small right pleural effusion is also seen. There is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax on this semi-erect radiograph. The tip of the endotracheal tube abuts the tracheal wall. An enteric tube and right internal jugular catheter are unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent in part related to low lung volumes and AP technique.
