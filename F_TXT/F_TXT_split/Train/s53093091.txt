There has been interval placement of a right pleural pigtail catheter with interval re-expansion of the atelectatic right lung and decreased size of the right pneumothorax with a small residual pneumothorax remaining. It is approximately 5 mm in width. Previously noted signs of tension have resolved, as the mediastinum now is in normal position and no longer pushed leftward. The cardiac size is normal. There is a small amount of linear atelectasis at the right base. There is no evidence of consolidation or re-expansion edema. No large pleural effusion is noted.
