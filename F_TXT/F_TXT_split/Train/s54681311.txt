As compared to the previous radiograph, the PICC line has been pulled back. The tip of the line now projects over the inflow tract of the right atrium, further pull back by 1-2 cm would ensure a safe position in the mid-to-lower SVC. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise unchanged radiograph.
