AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day. Previously described left subclavian central venous line in unchanged position. Left-sided chest tube apparently has been exchanged and the new line seen to reach the apical area of the left hemithorax more medially than on the previous line that terminated in the shoulder area. The line appears to be in good position. No new parenchymal abnormalities are seen and no pneumothorax has developed. The patient is now intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea 5 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. There is a diffuse haze over the right hemithorax with the patient in supine position. Most likely, this represents pleural effusion that is layering in the posterior compartment of the pleural space.
