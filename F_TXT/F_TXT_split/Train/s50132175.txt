Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position. Nasogastric tube has been removed. Widespread calcified pleural plaques are consistent with prior asbestos exposure and obscure underlying lung detail. Left lower lobe opacity has improved and is likely related to atelectasis. No new areas of lung consolidation are identified to suggest an acute aspiration event, but a subtle area of aspiration would be difficult to detect given the extensive pleural disease in this patient.
