Chest, portable upright. There is moderate pulmonary edema as well as small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with bibasilar atelectasis. The heart size is minimally enlarged, unchanged from the patient's baseline. Unchanged widening of the mediastinum is attributable to mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Aorta remains tortuous. There is no pneumothorax. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is partially imaged. Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are noted.
