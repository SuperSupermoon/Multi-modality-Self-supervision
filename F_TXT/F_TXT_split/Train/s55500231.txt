A single frontal AP view of the chest shows a defomities of the right ___ and 7th ribs, accounting for a hazy ill-defined opacity overlying the right mid lung. Right hilar fullness is present and may be due to the known lymphadenopathy. The known spiculated mass is not well seen. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is unchanged and likely due to a small left pleural effusion. There is no right pleural effusion. The lung volumes are low. Increased interstitial prominence is likely due to exaggeration of the pulmonary vasculature by the low lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but stable from the prior exam. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aortic arch. Clips in the left chest wall are noted and unchanged.
