Compared with prior chest radiograph and chest CTA, there is an apparent increase in opacification of the left lower lobe and associated small pleural effusion. The right basilar opacity is not significantly changed from prior and is known to represent metastatic disease. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. The Port-A-Cath catheter ends in the right atrium in unchanged position.
