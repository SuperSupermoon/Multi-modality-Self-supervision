Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, left chest tubes, and right internal jugular lines are unchanged in position. The patient is status post median sternotomy for recent aortic repair. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There continues to be stable patchy retrocardiac opacity with probable associated small effusion consistent with lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Interval decrease in the pneumopericardium. Right lung remains grossly clear. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
