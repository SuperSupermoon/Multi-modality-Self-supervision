In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 2 weeks prior, there is significant gaseous dilation of the esophagus. There is noted, mild, pulmonary vascular congestion and increased opacities at the bilateral lung bases, possibly dependent pulmonary edema, atelectasis, or developing pneumonia. There is probably a small left pleural effusion. Heart size is minimally enlarged. A right-sided PICC terminates in the right atrium, approximately 3 cm inferior to the superior cavoatrial junction.
