Comparison is made to the prior radiographs from eight hours earlier and radiographs from ___. There is an endotracheal tube, right central venous catheter, left-sided AICD, and a feeding tube, which appear unchanged in position. There is extensive cardiomegaly and there are diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally. Opacities are more confluent in the left base and right upper lobe. The right upper lobe area appears better aerated since the previous study. There are no densities projecting over the bronchi to suggest an aspirated tooth. There is no free air underneath the hemidiaphragms.
