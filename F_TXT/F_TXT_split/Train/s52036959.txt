Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the cardiac silhouette size which appears mildly enlarged. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is demonstrated with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
