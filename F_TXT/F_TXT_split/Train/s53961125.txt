Lung volumes are low, but the heart size, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal. The tip of the endotracheal tube is difficult to identify, as it is superimposed on the enteric tube. However, correlation with the CTA head and neck suggests that the tip is approximately 3.0 cm above the carina. Bibasilar subtle opacities may reflect changes from aspiration. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm, curls in the stomach, and courses out of view.
