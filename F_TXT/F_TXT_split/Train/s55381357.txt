Heart size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Lung volumes are low which results in crowding of bronchovascular structures. No overt pulmonary edema is present. Patchy atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal consolidation. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is present. There is no subdiaphragmatic free air. Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
