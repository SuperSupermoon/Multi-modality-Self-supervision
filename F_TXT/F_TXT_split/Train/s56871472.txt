No pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Mild reticulation at the base of the right lung suggests very minimal edema in the setting of emphysema. Decreased caliber to the mediastinum and paratracheal soft tissues, probably due to decreased edema associated with the neoesophagus. Heart size is normal. There is no pulmonary consolidation or pleural effusion.
