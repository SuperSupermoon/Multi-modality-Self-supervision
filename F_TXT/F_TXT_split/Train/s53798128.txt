In the right lung, small to moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. Additional opacity of the right lung base is also similar in appearance, and this may be due to infectious consolidation or layering of the pleural effusion. The left lung is essentially clear. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Stable cardiomegaly. The aortic root stent graft is unchanged in position.
