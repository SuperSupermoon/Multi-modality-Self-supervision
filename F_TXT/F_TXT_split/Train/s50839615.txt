AP chest compared to ___ and ___:43 p.m.: There has been very little change, except for decrease in the basal medial components of the moderate right pneumothorax, now predominantly apical, and the small amount of pleural fluid or thickening at the lateral aspect of the persistent pleural space. Edema in the postoperative right lung is unchanged. Left lung is grossly clear. Severe subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall, superficial and deep tissues of the neck and mediastinum is all unchanged. Right pleural tube orientation also stable. Whether this drain could be fissural would depend upon the anatomy of the postoperative right lung.
