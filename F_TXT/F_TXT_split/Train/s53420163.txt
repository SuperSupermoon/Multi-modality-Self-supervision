Compared with prior radiographs on ___, an ET tube terminates at the origin of the right main bronchus with head in flexed position, and should be pulled back 3 cm. A right IJ is located deep in the right atrium, and should be pulled back 4 cm. The right PICC terminates at the junction of the right brachiocephalic vein and SVC. An NG tube passes below the level of the diaphragm and out of view. There is an increase in right basilar opacity, likely reflecting atelectasis or aspiration. No pneumothorax.
