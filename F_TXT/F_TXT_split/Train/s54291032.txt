Low lung volumes continued to decrease, reflecting ___ more severe atelectasis in the right middle in both lower lobes. . There may be a new moderate left pleural effusion. A large region of opacity in the left midlung could be pulmonary hemorrhage or fissural pleural left effusion. No pleural drain is identified. There is no pneumothorax. Heart is not enlarged and mediastinal veins are not dilated. The apparent mediastinal contour in the region of the aortic knob has grown larger and lobulated. I suggest repeating the chest radiograph within 12 hr to see if this is a persistent finding which would warrant chest CT.
