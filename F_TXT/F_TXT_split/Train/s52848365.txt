There is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. Hazy opacification in the right mid and lower lung with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial layering pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
