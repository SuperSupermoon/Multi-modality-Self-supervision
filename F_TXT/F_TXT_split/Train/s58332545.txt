Comparison is made with prior study CT performed the same day earlier. Small-to-moderate right and large left pleural effusions associated with adjacent atelectasis are stable from CT from earlier the same day but have markedly increased from ___. Cardiac silhouette is obscured by the pleural effusion. Smaller nodular opacities seen in the CT are below the resolution of this radiograph. Tracheostomy tip is in standard position. Left PICC tip is in the mid SVC. There are low lung volumes.
