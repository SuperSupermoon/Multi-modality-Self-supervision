ET tube has advanced from the carina where it was positioned yesterday to the proximal right bronchus and should be withdrawn at least 4 cm. Lung volumes are very low but there is no focal pulmonary abnormality. Heart size is top-normal exaggerated by low lung volumes. Right jugular line ends in the right atrium and a nasogastric drainage tube is curled in the stomach.
