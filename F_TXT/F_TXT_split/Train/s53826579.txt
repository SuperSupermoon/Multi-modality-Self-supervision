An endotracheal tube ends 4.6 cm from the carina. A right internal jugular central line ends in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Large bilateral pleural effusions have increased in size from the prior radiograph and obscure large areas of the lungs, particularly in the lower lobes. Overlying devices obscure the upper lobes. Given these limitations, no new consolidations are seen. Stable mediastinal vascular engorgement and mild volume overload is unchanged. Mild enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
