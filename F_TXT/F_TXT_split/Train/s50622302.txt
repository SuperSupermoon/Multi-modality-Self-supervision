There is relative lucency at the right upper lung, corresponding to a large bulla seen on prior chest CT. Lower lung reticular opacities are consistent with clinical history/chest CT of pulmonary fibrosis. A more confluent region of opacity in the right lower lung is new, raising the possibility of superimposed infection. The heart and mediastinum are stable.
