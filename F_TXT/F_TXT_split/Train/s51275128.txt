Radiograph centered in the lower chest was obtained for assessment of nasogastric tube, which terminates within the distal stomach. Moderate gastric distention is noted. The exam was not tailored to evaluate the thoracic structures, and extreme lung apices and upper mediastinum are excluded from the study as well as the periphery of the lower right hemithorax. With this limitation in mind, there has not been a substantial short-interval change in the appearance of the chest since the recent study of a few days earlier.
