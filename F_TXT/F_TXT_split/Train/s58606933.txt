A single portable supine chest radiograph was obtained. An endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube extends inferiorly into the stomach. The lungs are well expanded. The moderate right hilar opacity obscures the right hilar contour. Otherwise the cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. Prominence of upper lobe vasculature indicates mild fluid overload.
