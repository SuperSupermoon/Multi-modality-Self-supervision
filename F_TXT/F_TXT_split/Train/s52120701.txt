An ET tube is present -- tip lies approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A left IJ central line is present, tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen is cardiomegaly and diffuse vascular blurring, together with moderate-sized bilateral effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Compared with ___ at 19:20 p.m., I doubt significant interval change.
