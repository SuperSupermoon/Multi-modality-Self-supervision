The tip of the endotracheal tube lies 12 mm from the carinal angle and should be withdrawn to a better position. Nasogastric tube is present in a good position. Opacification of the left lower lobe is present, probably representing atelectasis rather than effusion. Elsewhere, the lung fields are clear.
