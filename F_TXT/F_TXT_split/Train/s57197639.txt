A tracheostomy is in place. The endogastric tube courses inferiorly out of the field of view. There is noted to be a left-sided chest tube in place. Widespread subcutaneous emphysema is seen throughout practically all the visualized soft tissues. The heart size is large, but stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. A right-sided central venous catheter tip is seen at the lower SVC. The overlying soft tissue emphysema limits assessment of the lung consolidations. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
