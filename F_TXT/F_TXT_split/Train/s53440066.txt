Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 2:07 p.m. Widespread parenchymal opacities are unchanged. Right chest tube appears to be slightly more distal than on the prior study. Left internal jugular line, right Port-A-Cath catheter appeared to be unchanged as well. The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. The ET tube tip is approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Overall, no substantial change since the prior study is demonstrated.
