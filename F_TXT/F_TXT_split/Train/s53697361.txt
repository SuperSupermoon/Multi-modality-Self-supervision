Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in standard position. Heart size is normal. Bilateral multilobar pulmonary opacities are again demonstrated, some of which have a poorly defined nodular character, and others, particularly in the lower lobes, are more confluent. Observed findings are consistent with multilobar pneumonia. Considering the nodular quality to some of the opacities, septic emboli and fungal organisms should be considered in addition to bacterial pathogens.
