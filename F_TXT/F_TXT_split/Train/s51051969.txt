As compared to the previous radiograph, there is little overall change. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3.4 cm above the carina. The position of the nasogastric tube and of the left central venous access line are constant. The right lung bases are minimally better ventilated than before. The parenchymal opacities at the left lung bases, including a component of retrocardiac atelectasis, are unchanged. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, no newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
