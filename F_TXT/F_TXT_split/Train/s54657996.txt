Single frontal portable view of the chest demonstrates small bilateral pleural effusions. The right pleural effusion has decreased slightly in size and the left remains unchanged. Heart size is enlarged. Increased perihilar prominence and cephalization of vasculature is compatible with volume overload. A left dialysis catheter terminates in the mid SVC. A right-sided pacemaker is seen with wires terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, as expected. There is no suspicious osseous lesions. No pneumothorax is seen.
