Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval distal advancement of the endotracheal tube, with tip in the right main stem bronchus. The previously seen parenchymal infiltrate at the left lung base is again demonstrated on this study and likely represents atelectasis with possibly some pleural fluid. There is bilateral pulmonary edema, left greater than right, which is unchanged since the prior exam. A nasogastric tube is seen with tip in the distal stomach.
