AP portable upright view of the chest. An orogastric tube terminates in the left upper quadrant. There is a left arm PICC line with its tip residing in the low SVC. Hazy lower lung opacities likely reflect layering effusions with probable subjacent atelectasis. There has been slight improvement in aeration compared with the prior exam with previously noted airspace consolidations appearing less conspicuous. The mid-upper lungs appear well-aerated. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.
