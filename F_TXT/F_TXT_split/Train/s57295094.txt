In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little overall change. Again there are relatively low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, significant pulmonary edema, and mild pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases. In view of the extensive pulmonary changes, in the appropriate clinical setting it would be impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
