Endotracheal tube ends approximately 5.3 cm from the carina and is appropriately positioned. Orogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm; however, its distal end is of radiographic view. Right internal jugular line extends to upper SVC. Mild-to-moderately enlarged heart, bilateral perihilar haze, prominent right pulmonary artery and diffuse lung haziness obscuring the bronchovascular marking suggest moderately severe pulmonary edema. There are presumed small bilateral effusions. No pneumothorax.
