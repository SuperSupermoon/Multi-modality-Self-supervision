Patient positioning is somewhat suboptimal, this limits assessment of the cardiomediastinal contour. In particular, the position of the tip of the right-sided PICC cannot be definitively assessed but appears to be in the right atrium. Similar in appearance when compared to the prior study. There is increased prominence of the bilateral hila with perihilar airspace opacity consistent with pulmonary edema, this has increased slightly when compared to the prior study. Presumed small left pleural effusion. No right-sided pleural effusion seen. No pneumothorax seen.
