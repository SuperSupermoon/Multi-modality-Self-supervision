1. A left-sided pacer remains in place, likely unchanged, although the distal portion of both leads is not well seen due to differences in technique. The patient's mandible obscures the right lung apex. Lung volumes are low and there are likely bilateral effusions, right greater than left which are likely not significantly changed. Overall, the degree of pulmonary edema is stable. The heart remains enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax is seen given the limitations of this examination.
