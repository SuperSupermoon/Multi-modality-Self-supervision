In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. Low lung volumes may accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Persistent opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. Less prominent effusion and atelectatic changes seen on the right, with some extension of fluid into the minor fissure. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
