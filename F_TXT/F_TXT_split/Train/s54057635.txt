The heart does not appear enlarged. The aorta is unfolded, contributing to prominence of the mediastinal silhouette. The hila are also slightly prominent, with a tapered appearance. An IABP is present -- the tip overlies the expected location of the descending aorta. However, the radiopaque tip probably lies approximately 2.5 cm below the inferior edge of the aortic arch itself. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. No focal consolidation. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. No gross effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
