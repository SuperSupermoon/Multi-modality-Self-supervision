Compared to the examination from roughly 3 hours prior, there has been interval placement of a left base pigtail catheter and there has been mild improvement of a large left pleural effusion which remains substantial. There may be a tiny left pneumothorax with possible pleural reflection in seen overlying the lateral left second rib. Otherwise no short-term interval change.
