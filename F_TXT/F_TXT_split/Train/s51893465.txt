Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 5 cm above the carina at the level of the aortic knob and appropriately sited. Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal. There is mild prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings without overt pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are seen. There is a right-sided PICC line whose distal tip is at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged from prior.
