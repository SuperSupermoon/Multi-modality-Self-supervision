Innumerable bilateral pulmonary opacities are seen in this patient with extensive bilateral pulmonary metastases. More confluent area in the left mid to lower hemi thorax was most likely present on the prior chest CT. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to a trace pleural effusion versus atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unremarkable. Left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates at the low SVC/cavoatrial junction.
