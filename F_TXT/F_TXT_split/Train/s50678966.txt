CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW An ET tube is present. The carina is not well delineated, but the tip of the ET tube probably lies approximately 3.3 cm above the carina, just below the inferior edge of the clavicular heads. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. A left-sided indwelling catheter is present, with tip over proximal/mid SVC. Question slight rotation or more likely slight volume loss on the right. The entire right hemithorax is opacified, with a single clip seen in the right mid zone. The right hemidiaphragm is obscured. On the left, there is slight prominence of the vascular or interstitial markings, more pronounced superiorly. There is more confluent opacity in the left lung apex medially. There is also some patchy retrocardiac opacity. Elsewhere in the left lung, no confluent opacities are seen and there is no gross left effusion. Compared with ___ at 19:12 p.m., faint air bronchograms in the right mid zone are less well delineated. Opacity in the right base medially is slightly worse. Confluent opacity in the right lung apex medially may also be slightly worse. These findings are more completely delineated on a chest CT from ___ at 20:23 p.m.
