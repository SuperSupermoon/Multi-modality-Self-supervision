Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a right internal jugular line, which terminates in the mid SVC. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, or other complication. The heart size appears mildly increased in size since the prior study, with hazy opacifications in the right upper lung and right lung base. These findings could represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, however the right lower lobe opacity suggests possible underlying pneumonia. The left lung is clear.
