The patient's mandible obscures the lung apices. The patchy opacity at the right lung base is less well appreciated due to differences in positioning but is likely not changed. No new area of consolidation is appreciated. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax is seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient positioning. Deformity of the right proximal humerus is consistent with old fracture.
