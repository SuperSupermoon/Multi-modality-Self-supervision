Interval intubation with endotracheal tube in standard position about 5 cm above the carina. New tubular collection of contrast is present corresponding to the pattern of a bronchus in the right infrahilar region consistent with aspirated oral contrast in the setting of visualized oral contrast within the imaged portion of the upper stomach. Nasogastric tube is in place with sideport projecting proximal to GE junction level. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for positional and projectional differences. Moderate left and large layering right pleural effusions are present, as well as persistent bilateral lower lobe opacities in keeping with extensive atelectasis in this region demonstrated on recent CTA of earlier the same date. Multiple acute right rib fractures are also noted.
