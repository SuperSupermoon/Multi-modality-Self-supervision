The right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter continues to have its tip in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery. Pull-back of 4-5 cm would be recommended. The nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified but the side port at the gastroesophageal junction. Advancement of this tube is also recommended. The endotracheal tube, left internal jugular central line, and intra-aortic balloon pump are unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Diffuse bilateral airspace process is unchanged. There may be layering pleural ffusions.
