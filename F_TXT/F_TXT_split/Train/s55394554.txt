ET tube in standard placement. Left subclavian line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction, nasogastric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach. No pneumothorax. We noted that in the absence of continued negative pleural pressure, reexpansion pulmonary edema generally resolves within 24 hours of the thoracentesis. Dr. ___ was paged at 10:35 a.m.
