As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing left basal and lateral pleural opacities have substantially decreased in extent and severity. The radiolucency of the left lung has increased. Subtle perihilar opacities at the right lung base are constant. In the interval, the endotracheal tube was removed and then tracheostomy tube was placed. No nasogastric tube is visualized. No pneumothorax or other complication.
