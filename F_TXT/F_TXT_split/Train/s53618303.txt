Comparison is made with prior study performed six hours earlier. NG tube is no longer visualized. ET tube is in standard position. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is too distal in the right pulmonary artery, it should be withdrawn at least 4 cm for more standard position. Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable, is possible that there is pericardial effusion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Retrocardiac opacities consistent with atelectasis are unchanged. Intra-aortic balloon pump tip is 3.1 cm above the left main bronchus, can be withdrawn 1 cm. When compared to prior study performed a day earlier, the intra-aortic balloon pump was more distally located in appropriate position. There is mild vascukar congestion with no overt edema.
