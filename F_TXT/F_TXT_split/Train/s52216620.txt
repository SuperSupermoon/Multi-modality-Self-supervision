In comparison with the study of ___, there are substantially lower lung volumes. Right chest tube remains in place and there is minimal if any residual pneumothorax. Blunting of the costophrenic angles could reflect small pleural effusions, though they may merely be a manifestation of low lung volumes. Little if any elevation of pulmonary venous pressure and no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
