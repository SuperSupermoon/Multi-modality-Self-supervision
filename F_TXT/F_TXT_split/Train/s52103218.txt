A right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. Sternotomy wires are stable in configuration with fractures of the upper two wires. A right basilar chest tube remains in place. Slightly increased relative lucency at the medial right base may be due to a tiny residual anterior pneumothorax. Prominent interstitial markings particularly in the periphery and at the bases are compatible with the known interstitial abnormality. The right pleural effusion has resolved.
