Radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessment of a nasogastric tube, which terminates in the expected location of the proximal duodenum. Within the chest, stable cardiomegaly is present, as well as slightly improving patchy and linear opacities in the lower lungs, most likely due to atelectasis. Small right pleural effusion is also noted.
