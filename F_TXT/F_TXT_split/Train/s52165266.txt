Portable AP semiupright chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs are low in volume giving the appearance of bronchovascular crowding with bibasilar atelectasis. Despite this, interstitial abnormality suggests the presence of mild pulmonary edema. Assessment for effusions is limited as the left and a small portion of the right base are excluded from view though no large effusion is present. Mild cardiomegaly with tortuous aortic contour.
