Endotracheal tube is well positioned, terminating 3.7 cm above the carina. Left-sided central venous catheter does not cross midline and is likely within the distal aspect of the left brachiocephalic vein. Enteric catheter courses below left hemidiaphragm and out of view. There is mildly increased bibasilar opacifications, left greater than right, which may reflect worsening pneumonia; however, there is also increased mild background pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
