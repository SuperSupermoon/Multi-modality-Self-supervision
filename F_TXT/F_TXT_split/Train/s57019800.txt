An NG tube remains with its sidehole within the stomach, and a right subclavian central venous catheter tip is positioned in the lower SVC. Cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are normal. Displaced left rib fractures of the posterior fourth and fifth ribs are unchanged. Bibasilar atelectasis, and large left and moderate right pleural effusions along with mild central pulmonary edema are unchanged.
