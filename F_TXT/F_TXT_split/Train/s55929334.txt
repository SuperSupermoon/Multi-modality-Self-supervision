A single portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained. Lung volumes have slightly increased since yesterday morning. Diffuse pulmonary opacities are again seen throughout both lungs. There is no effusion or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The tip of a right PICC line terminates in the low SVC.
