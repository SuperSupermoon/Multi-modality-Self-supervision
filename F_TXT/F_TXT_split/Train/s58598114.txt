A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates moderately well-aerated lungs with a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Streaky opacities in the bilateral lung bases are most compatible with atelectasis, with slightly better aeration of the left lower lung compared to chest radiograph in the day prior. There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable, other than surgical clips projecting over the mid abdomen.
