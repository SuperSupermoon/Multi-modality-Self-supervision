Large left juxtahilar mass within the superior segment of the left lower lobe extending to the left hilar structures appears similar to the recent radiograph but has been more fully characterized on CTA of the chest of one day earlier. Heart is upper limits of normal in size and the aorta is tortuous. Displacement of trachea is due to known right thyroid mass. Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are present as well as subtle basilar interstitial opacities at the lung bases, possibly due to asbestos-related interstitial changes. No focal areas of consolidation are evident to suggest the presence of an acute pneumonia.
