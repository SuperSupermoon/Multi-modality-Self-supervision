A left-sided chest tube is noted with tip projecting over the left apex. A tiny residual left apical pneumothorax is noted. Opacity within the medial aspect of the left apex likely reflects postoperative hemorrhage. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. No shift of mediastinal structures is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Please note that the extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.
