Left central line ends at mid SVC. With patient's neck in flexed position, the endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.6 cm above the carina and is adequately placed. A feeding tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, the distal end is beyond the view of radiograph. Bilateral lung volumes are low. Pig catheter in the left lower thorax is present. Due to the differences in the patient position, accurate comparison for interval changes in the pleural effusion was limited. Withing the limitations, as compared to the ___ radiograph, moderate right pleural effusion appears unchanged, moderate left pleural effusion has increased, and retrocardiac density suggesting left lower lobe volume loss has worsened. Top normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
