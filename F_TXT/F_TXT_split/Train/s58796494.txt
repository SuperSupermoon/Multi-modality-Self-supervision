A portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube in the mid to lower thoracic trachea, left approach central line with the tip in the low SVC, and nasoenteric tube coursing below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image. There has been interval resolution of a right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is present. Mild pulmonary edema is greater on the right than left. Bibasilar consolidations could represent atelectasis, but a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
