Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 2.7 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image, but side port appears to be in the left upper quadrant in expected location of the stomach. There is left base opacity which may represent combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis or underlying consolidation due to aspiration or contusion. Additional left perihilar opacity is seen which may also relate to aspiration, asymmetric pulmonary edema, or infection. There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and a trace pleural effusion may be present. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. The superior mediastinum remains widened although slightly less prominent as compared to this prior study and findings are likely accentuated by supine position in the AP technique. However, if there is clinical concern for acute mediastinal injury, CT is more sensitive.
