Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm from the carina. Enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm and into the stomach. Right subclavian central venous catheter appears to be malpositioned coursing cephalad into the right internal jugular vein. Right-sided dual lumen central venous catheter is demonstrated with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. Heart size is mildly enlarged, increased compared to the previous exam. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to supine positioning. Mild pulmonary edema is present. Streaky atelectasis is noted in both lung bases, more pronounced on the left. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present, though hazy opacities bilaterally in the lungs may suggest small layering pleural effusions. No large pneumothorax is identified on this supine image. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
