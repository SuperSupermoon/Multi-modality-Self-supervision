Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm, with side port in the region of the distal stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are similar in appearance to the prior study. Bilateral layering, moderate right and moderate-to-large left pleural effusions are again demonstrated, with adjacent bibasilar lung opacities which probably represent atelectasis.
