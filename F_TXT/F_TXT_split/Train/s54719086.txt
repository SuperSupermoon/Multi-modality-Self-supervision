Comparison is made to prior radiographs from ___ and of the CT scan performed on ___ at 11:35 a.m. There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 5 cm above the carina. This could be advanced 1 cm for more optimal placement. There is a left-sided IJ central line whose distal tip is not well seen but appears to be within the brachiocephalic vein. The heart size is within normal limits. There are very low lung volumes causing crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings and atelectasis at the lung bases. No overt pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces are present.
