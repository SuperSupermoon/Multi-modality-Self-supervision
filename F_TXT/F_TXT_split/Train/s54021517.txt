As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have minimally increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, combined with areas of atelectasis at the lung bases and pulmonary edema, however, persist. The monitoring and support devices are unchanged. There is no evidence for newly appeared parenchymal opacities in the lung parenchyma.
