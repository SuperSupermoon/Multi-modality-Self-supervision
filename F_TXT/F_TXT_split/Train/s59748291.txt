Single AP view of the chest demonstrates clear lungs bilaterally with focal opacity worrisome for pneumonia. Allowing for suboptimal technique, heart size appears top normal in size. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion, although the right costophrenic angle is incompletely visualized. Osseous structures are without acute abnormality.
