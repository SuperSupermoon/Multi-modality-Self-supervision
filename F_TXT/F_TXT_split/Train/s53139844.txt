Single upright AP view of the chest. The new right IJ central line terminates in the mid SVC. The lungs are well expanded. Bibasilar atelectasis is again seen, similar prior exam. The previously seen retrocardiac opacity has significantly improved from prior exam, consistent with resolving atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged, but there is no evidence acute decompensation or edema. Aneurymal dilation of the aorta is noted.
