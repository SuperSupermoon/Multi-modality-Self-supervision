A Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower superior vena cava. The lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is similar flattening of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour with a suspected pleural effusion, including mild relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, though less striking than on the prior examination. There is no pneumothorax. Compared to the prior study, aeration is much better bilaterally and the lungs are essentially clear.
