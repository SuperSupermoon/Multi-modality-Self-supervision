AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding semi-upright chest examination obtained two hours earlier during the same day. Patient is now intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea 6 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. Moderate cardiac enlargement, status post sternotomy and right-sided internal jugular approach central venous line unchanged. Previously described bilateral diffuse parenchymal densities persist, rather unchanged. Again differential diagnosis includes massive bilateral aspiration, but central pulmonary edema cannot be excluded completely.
