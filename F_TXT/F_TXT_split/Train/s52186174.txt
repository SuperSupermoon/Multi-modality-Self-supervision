Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications. Hilar contours are unremarkable. Left PICC has been removed. Scarring is seen within the lung apices. Increased peripheral interstitial markings are noted bilaterally, more pronounced within the upper lung zones, and reflective of a chronic interstitial abnormality, better assessed on the prior CT. Atelectatic changes are noted in the lung bases, but no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or definite pneumothorax is identified. Skin ___ are seen projecting over the midline abdomen. No free subdiaphragmatic air is seen though the patient is not an optimal upright position.
