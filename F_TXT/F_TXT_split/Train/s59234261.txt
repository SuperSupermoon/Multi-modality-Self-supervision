Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a nasogastric tube with the tip projecting over the stomach. The proximal side port is poorly visualized but likely at the GE junction. In order to position the proximal side port in the stomach, it should be advanced by no less than 3-5 cm. A right-sided PICC is seen in the low SVC. Compared to the prior exam there has been interval decrease in lung volumes which exaggerates the heart size and vascular caliber. No pleural abnormalities or other relevant change is seen.
