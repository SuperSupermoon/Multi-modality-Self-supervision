There has been interval removal of the left basilar pigtail catheter. No pneumothorax is appreciated. There continues to be elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with a patchy opacity in the left mid and lower lung, which could reflect combination of the known left upper lobe malignancy as well as some scattered areas of atelectasis given correlation with selected images from a chest CT dated ___. The right lung remains grossly clear. Compared to the prior study of ___, there is likely no significant interval change. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the left airspace disease.
