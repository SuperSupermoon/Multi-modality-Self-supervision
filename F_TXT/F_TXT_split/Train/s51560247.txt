Right upper lobe atelectasis is of unknown chronicity without older radiographs for comparison. If it is acute, it could be due to a mucus plug in the bronchus; however, an obstructing mass is also possible, especially considering slight rounded contour and increased density of the right hilum. Minimal interstitial lung markings at lung bases, also of unknown chronicity, could reflect atelectasis or focal scarring/fibrosis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are unremarkable.
