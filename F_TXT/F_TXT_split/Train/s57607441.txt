Interval intubation with tip of endotracheal tube terminating 6.2 cm above the carina. The cuff of the tube appears slightly overdistended. Heart size is normal, and the aorta is tortuous. The lungs demonstrate upper lobe predominant emphysema. Worsening patchy opacity at left lung base could be due to patchy atelectasis, aspiration, or developing pneumonia. Mild elevation of left hemidiaphragm is present, but decreased in extent likely due to decreased gastric distention following placement of a nasogastric tube.
