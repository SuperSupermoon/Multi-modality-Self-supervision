AP chest compared to ___: Heterogeneous pulmonary consolidation is quite severe, and asymmetric enough to make multifocal pneumonia much more likely than pulmonary edema. Overall, the extent of the process has progressed since earlier on ___. Pleural effusions are presumed, and could be considerable on the left, although there is no mediastinal shift. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. ET tube in standard placement. Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right supraclavicular central venous catheter ends in the upper right atrium, while a left PICC line can be traced as far as the left brachiocephalic vein and a left jugular line to the origin of the SVC. No pneumothorax.
