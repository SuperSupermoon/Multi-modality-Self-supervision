Nasogastric tube terminates to the right of midline within a very large hiatal hernia. Dedicated fluoro study is recommended to evaluate for clinical suspicion for gastric volvulus. Cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise remarkable for a tortuous thoracic aorta. Patchy and linear basilar opacities may reflect atelectasis and/or aspiration. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
