AP chest compared to ___: Although interstitial pulmonary edema is mild and not appreciably changed since ___, moderate right pleural effusion has increased substantially, accompanied by greater distention of mediastinal veins. A small left pleural effusion has increased slightly. The large region of opacification in the right mid lung could be due to a combination of focal edema and effusion, but whether there is concurrent pneumonia would require repeat imaging after improvement in hemodynamic status. Same can be said for apparent consolidation at the base of the left lung, which, alternatively, could be due to atelectasis. Findings were discussed by telephone with renal fellow who is caring for this patient.
