1. Endotracheal tube has its tip 4.7 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal limits given portable technique and current positioning. Streaky linear opacities at the left base reflect patchy atelectasis, although an early infectious process should also be considered. No large effusions. No pneumothorax is appreciated. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
