Compared with the prior film, the ET tube and NG tube are no longer visualized. The patient is rotated and his head is turned and the inspiratory volumes are slightly lower, which may account for slightly more prominent appearance of the superior mediastinum. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. There is bibasilar atelectasis. There is patchy increased retrocardiac density, which may be slightly more pronounced than on the prior film. The right costophrenic angle is obscured by overlying materials and the extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film. Allowing for this, no pleural effusions are seen on either side. Slight elevation the right hemidiaphragm is now visible. No pneumothorax detected. At the upper edge of these films, a fixation plate is seen in relation to the mandible.
