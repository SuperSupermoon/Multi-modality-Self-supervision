As compared to ___ radiograph, Swan-Ganz catheter has been it advanced slightly, now terminating in the expected location of the interlobar right pulmonary artery. Support and monitoring devices are otherwise unchanged in position, and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is also stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion persists, as well as a bilateral asymmetrical pattern of ground-glass opacification, reticulation and localized consolidation in, the latter predominantly affecting the right juxta hilar region. Overall, this is slightly improved since the prior radiograph.
