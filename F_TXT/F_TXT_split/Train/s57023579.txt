As compared to the previous radiograph, the previous Dobbhoff catheter has been removed and replaced by a feeding tube. The course of the feeding tube is unremarkable, the tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach, the radiograph shows no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the lung parenchyma is unchanged.
