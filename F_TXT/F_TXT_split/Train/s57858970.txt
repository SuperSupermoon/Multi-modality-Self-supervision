Free intraperitoneal air below the right hemidiaphragm is present, possibly related to recent PEG placement, but clinical correlation is suggested to exclude the possibility of perforated viscus. Within the chest, cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Small-to-moderate left and small right pleural effusions have decreased in size since recent radiograph, with accompanying slight improvement in bibasilar opacities, with residual opacities most prominent in the retrocardiac region, left greater than right. No new areas of consolidation are evident to suggest a new site of infection in the lungs.
