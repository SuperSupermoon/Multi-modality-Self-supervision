As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Two fiducial markers in the left lung, status post sternotomy, right upper mediastinal and perihilar post-surgical clips. No evidence of pneumonia. No pleural effusions. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Again noted is that the subtle ground-glass opacities, previously described on a CT examination on ___, are not visible on the current image.
