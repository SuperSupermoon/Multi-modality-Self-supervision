Assessment of the chest is limited by overlying trauma board and external devices. Endotracheal tube tip is slightly high, approximately 8.6 cm from the carina. Enteric tube tip terminates in the stomach, however the side port is above the gastroesophageal junction. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to low lung volumes, supine positioning, and AP technique. Ill-defined opacities are seen within both upper lobes and likely within the medial aspect of the right lung base, which may reflect areas of aspiration. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. There is no overt pulmonary edema identified. No displaced fractures are evident.
