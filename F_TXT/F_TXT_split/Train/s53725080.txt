Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier. Allowing the difference in positioning of the patient, there is no interval change in the appearance of the chest with a stable large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, multifocal consolidations in the right upper, left upper and left lower lobes. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated. Cardiomediastinum is unchanged, shifted towards the left. Tracheostomy tube in standard position. Left PICC tip in the mid SVC.
