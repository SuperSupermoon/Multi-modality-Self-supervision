AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. Tracheostomy is in place with its tip partially obscured by the spinal hardware thus cannot be precisely determined. The Dobbhoff tube tip is in the stomach. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Bibasal atelectasis and left pigtail catheter are unchanged in appearance. The right lower lung atelectasis is noted, improved as compared to prior examination.
