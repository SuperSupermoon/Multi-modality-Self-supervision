Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained. Lungs are low in volume with linear opacities in right lung which could reflect atelectasis or aspiration. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The ET tube is 2 cm above the carina, but given the degree of kyphotic positioning could be in standard position. Nasogastric tube terminates in the fundus of the stomach. Left clavicular fracture and right rib fractures appear chronic.
