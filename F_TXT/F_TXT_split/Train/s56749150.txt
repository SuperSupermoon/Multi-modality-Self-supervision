Status post median sternotomy with stably enlarged cardiac contour which may reflect cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion. Clinical correlation is advised. Lung volumes are slightly lower with streaky opacities at both lung bases likely reflecting atelectasis. Minimal peribronchial cuffing suggests an element of mild interstitial edema. No pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax.
