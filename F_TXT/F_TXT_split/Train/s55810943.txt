AP chest compared to ___: The endotracheal tube is still positioned at the orifice of the left main bronchus and should be withdrawn 3-4 cm for appropriate positioning. Right internal jugular line ends in the mid-to-low SVC. Mild pulmonary edema has improved substantially, but small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is new and persistent opacification at the base of the left lung could be atelectasis and residual edema. Small left pleural effusion is presumed. Mild cardiomegaly stable. No pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
