1. Endotracheal tube has the tip approximately 2 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. External pacing wires are in place. There is interval worsening of bilateral effusions and right airspace disease which may reflect moderate pulmonary edema, although pulmonary hemorrhage or ARDS should also be considered. Retrocardiac region difficult to assess but could reflect lower lobe collapse, compressive atelectasis or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised.There is marked patient rotation, limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. However, the heart remains enlarged, most likely representing cardiomegaly as no large pericardial effusion was seen on the recent chest CT of ___. No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished on the supine radiographs. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. Degenerative changes in the spine.
