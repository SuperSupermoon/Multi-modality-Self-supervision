As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation or increased respiratory pressure. As a consequence, the bilateral areas of atelectatic changes at the lung bases have decreased in extent and severity. There are no newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities. Monitoring and support devices are constant, unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
