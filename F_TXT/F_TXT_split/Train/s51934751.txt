The heart is mildly enlarged. Streaky opacities in the left mid lung and right lung base are nonspecific but most suggestive of minor atelectasis or scarring (no prior studies available for comparison). Particularly along the right lateral chest wall, there are small horizontal subpleural lines, which may reflect subtle evidence for mild fluid overload or pulmonary venous congestion, but there is no frank evidence for congestive heart failure. There is no pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion.
