Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Emphysema is particularly severe in the right upper lobe. Persistent opacity at the base of the right lobe medially is a region of chronic, unexplained atelectasis. There is also a region of relative increased ___ in the right midlung, which should be evaluated with at least a lateral view to determine if there is a subtle pneumonia or an artifact of overlying soft tissue. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
