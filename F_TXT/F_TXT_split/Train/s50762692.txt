No NG tube is seen extending through the mediastinum or extending beneath the diaphragm. There is coiled tubing over the upper mediastinum, which may reflect coiling of the NG tube in the patient's upper esophagus and retropharynx. Background COPD, mild vascular plethora, bibasilar atelectasis, and equivocal small effusions noted. Left-sided dual-lead pacemaker noted. The uppermost chest is obscured by patient's chin.
