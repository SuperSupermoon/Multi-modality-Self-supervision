As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The tracheostomy tube and the right PICC line are in constant position. There is no new parenchymal opacity, but evidence of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, combined to a retrocardiac atelectasis persists. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax, no pneumomediastinum.
