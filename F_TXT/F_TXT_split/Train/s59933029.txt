ET tube tip is seen approximately 4.8 cm from the carina. Enteric tube is seen passing below the diaphragm with tip potentially the gastric fundus although not particularly well assessed due to technique and it could be lower. Relatively low lung volumes are noted. Linear opacities in the left mid and lower lung are likely secondary to atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly within normal limits. No displaced fractures identified.
