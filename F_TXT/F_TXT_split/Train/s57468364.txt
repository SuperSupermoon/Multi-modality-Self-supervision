The NG tube tip terminates in the region of the stomach having traversed through through the mediastinum. The radiograph is rotated. There is significant vascular calcification. Volume loss on the right apex is noted as well as a high-density subcarinal lesion presumptively lymph node. High-density material in the interpolar region on the left side there reflects some scarring as seen on prior radiographs. Patchy bilateral parenchymal infiltrates persist but not as pronounced on the prior study. Persistent high attenuation material projected over the apex.
