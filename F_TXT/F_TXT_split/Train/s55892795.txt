A right IJ catheter terminates within the mid SVC. A tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position, terminating 6.5 cm above the carina. A left IJ terminates at the lower SVC. Bilateral linear pulmonary opacities are again seen, compatible with atelectasis. A small right pleural effusion appears slightly improved. There is no pneumothorax.
