Study is somewhat limited by motion overlying soft tissue. The lung volumes are exceedingly low, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is elevation of the apparent right hemidiaphragm with lateralization of the apex, raising the possibility of a subpulmonic effusion. There is no strong evidence for pulmonary edema. Heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged, accounting for differences in technique. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. No pneumothorax.
