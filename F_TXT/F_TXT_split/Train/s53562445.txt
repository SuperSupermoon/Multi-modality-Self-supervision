Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Again seen is near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax, similar to prior. In the interval since the prior study, there has been development of a moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. The visualized cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the right aspect not well evaluated due to the right hemithorax opacification.
