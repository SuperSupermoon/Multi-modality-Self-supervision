No previous images. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Some obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Small amount of subcutaneous gas is seen adjacent to the lower lateral chest wall.
