Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened. In addition there may be focal consolidation in the right midlung and both lung bases, making it impossible to exclude concurrent aspiration pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal venous engorgement are worse, indicating at least a component of cardiac decompensation. Small right pleural effusion is presumed. There is no pneumothorax.
