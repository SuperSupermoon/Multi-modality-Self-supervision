AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The on previous examination described hazy parenchymal densities in the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe persist and may even have increased slightly. There are no other new abnormalities present. The previously described multiple old right-sided rib fractures and pleural scar formations on the left base remain unchanged. Observed multiple semi-linear lines traversing the upper thorax bilaterally. They should not be confused with a pneumothorax but most likely represent skin folds in this patient examined in semi-erect recumbent position.
