Portable frontal semiupright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval removal of the right subclavian catheter. Calcified hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes and granulomas in the left lower lung are unchanged. There is increased opacification at the left lung base which could represent atelectasis versus pneumonia. Linear opacification of the right lung base consistent with atelectasis. Normal heart size. No pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion.
