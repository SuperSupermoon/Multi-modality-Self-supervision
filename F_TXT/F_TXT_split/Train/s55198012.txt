Pigtail pleural catheter remains in place in the lower left hemithorax with decrease in adjacent pleural fluid, but overall moderate pleural effusion persists with loculated component in the left mid and upper hemithorax. No visible pneumothorax on this semi-upright radiograph. Left lower lobe opacities have improved compared the to previous radiograph with residual patchy and linear opacities remaining. On the right, pigtail pleural catheter remains in place at the right lung base, with no visible right pneumothorax, and no substantial pleural effusion. Minimal linear atelectasis persists at the right base. Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard position, and cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size.
