Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. A new opacity has developed in the left lower lobe, predominantly in the retrocardiac region, and could be due to atelectasis and effusion, but developing pneumonia is also possible given clinical suspicion for this entity. Right retrocardiac opacity is difficult to compare to the previous study, but may be slightly improved. Improving volume loss in this area favors at least a component of atelectasis.
