AP chest compared to ___: A small amount of air defines the track of the left apical pleural tube since removed. I would recommend a followup film in 24 hours to detect any clinically significant pneumothorax. Small volume of left pleural fluid is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, with substantial narrowing of what was presumably an upper mediastinal hematoma.
