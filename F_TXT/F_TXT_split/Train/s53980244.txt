Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable with minimal atherosclerotic calcifications noted in the aortic knob. Patchy opacities are seen within the left upper and lower lung fields which are nonspecific but may reflect areas of infection in the correct clinical setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is incompletely imaged.
