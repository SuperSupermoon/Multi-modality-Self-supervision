The patient is status post placement of a single lead ICD, with the tip of the lead overlying expected location of the right ventricle. However, precise location is difficult to confirm due to marked patient rotation and single view technique. With this in mind, standard PA and lateral chest radiograph may be helpful to confirm location when the patient's condition permits. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and the aorta is tortuous, both grossly without change allowing for rotation. Lungs are clear except for minimal linear atelectasis in the right lower lobe. Questionable small right pleural effusion, which can be confirmed or excluded by PA and lateral chest radiograph as well.
