There has been interval placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter with the tip terminating in the low right atrium. A left PICC has been slightly retracted with the tip now terminating at the level of the carina in the mid SVC. The patient is status post median sternotomy. The inspiratory lung volumes remain extremely low. There is increased opacification of the right lung base in comparison to the most recent prior study likely reflecting a combination of increased pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis. Left basilar atelectasis is unchanged. A small left pleural effusion is also noted with slightly increased left basilar atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is incompletely evaluated due to bibasilar opacification but is likely unchanged.
