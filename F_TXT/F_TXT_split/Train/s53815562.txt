Lung volumes remain diminished with crowding of the vasculature. Patchy opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.

Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. The endotracheal tube has been removed. No large effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
