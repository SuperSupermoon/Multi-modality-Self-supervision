No previous images. There is diffuse predominantly linear opacification bilaterally, more prominent on the right, most likely consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema. This is supported by the large heart in a patient with intact midline sternal wires consistent with CABG procedure. Opacification in the retrocardiac region is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and superimposed pleural effusion.
