The endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carina. The tip of the orogastric is not visualized, however, the tube extends at least to the gastroesophageal junction. Compared to the prior chest radiograph performed 4 hours ago the lung volumes are lower and moderate pulmonary vascular congestion is new. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis has progressed. Allowing for lower lung volumes, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Multiple chronic appearing left lateral rib fractures are noted.
