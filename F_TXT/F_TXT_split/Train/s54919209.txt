Heterogeneous opacities in the left mid to lower lung are highly concerning for infection. The lungs are otherwise essentially clear. Heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal. There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Note is made of an SVC stent, not significantly changed in position. There has been interval removal of a right internal jugular central venous catheter.
