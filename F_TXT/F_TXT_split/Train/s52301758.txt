Patient has underlying chronic interstitial lung disease. However, compared to chest radiograph from ___, there has been significant interval increase in bilateral pulmonary opacities as well as obscuration of the bilateral hemidiaphragms. Findings raise concern for bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, subtle suggestion of bibasilar air bronchograms raises concern for bilateral consolidations which may be due to infection and/ or aspiration. Underlying pulmonary edema may also be present.
