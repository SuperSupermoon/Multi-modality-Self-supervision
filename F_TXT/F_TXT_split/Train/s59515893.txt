As compared to the previous image, the right-sided chest tube has been removed. There is no evidence of pneumothorax on today's image. The right lung shows slightly better ventilation. The other monitoring and support devices are constant. Also constant is the appearance of the left lung, the cardiac silhouette as well as the relatively extensive bilateral cervical air collection in the soft tissues. Several linear lucencies in the neck also highlight the possibility of pneumomediastinum.
