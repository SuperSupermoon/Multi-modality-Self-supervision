In comparison to a chest radiograph obtained approximately 5 days prior, no significant changes are appreciated. The lungs are fully expanded and clear without focal consolidation. Costophrenic angles not well visualized, but likely due to soft tissue attenuation rather than pleural effusions, which would be tiny if present. Heart size is normal. Large, retrocardiac soft tissue abnormality mentioned on preoperative chest radiograph remains present.
