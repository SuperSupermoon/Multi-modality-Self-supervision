Compared to the prior film, the right IJ line appears to have been retracted, and now lies near the cavoatrial junction, perhaps very slightly distal to it. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is a left-sided dual lead pacemaker, with lead tips over right atrium right ventricle; marked cardiomegaly, with a calcified, unfolded aorta; CHF, with interstitial and probable areas of alveolar edema; and small right greater left effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Calcified nodes and granulomas again noted, consistent with prior granulomatous disease. No pneumothorax detected.
