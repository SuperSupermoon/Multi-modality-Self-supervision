Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiomegaly is stable. Right IJ catheter tip is in the cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are small, larger on the left, probably unchanged from prior study allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Bibasilar opacities, a combination of atelectasis and effusions, are stable. There is mild vascular congestion.
