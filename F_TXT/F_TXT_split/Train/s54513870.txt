Pulmonary edema has cleared since ___. There is no pneumonia in the upper lobes. Residual opacification at the lung bases, particularly in the right lower lobe is suggestive of pneumonia, but there may be some contribution of residual edema and atelectasis. Small pleural effusions are present. The heart is mildly enlarged, but improved. A right jugular infusion port ends in the SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
