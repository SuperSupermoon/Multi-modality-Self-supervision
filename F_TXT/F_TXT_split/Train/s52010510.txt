There is a new left-sided PleurX catheter with interval improvement of the loculated left pleural effusion. There is a small left basilar pneumothorax. There is a stable left apical density which may represent pleural fluid and/or thickening. Calcified pleural plaques are likely related to prior asbestos exposure. The heart and mediastinal contours appear to be stable with aortic calcifications. There appears to be slight interval worsening of diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema compared to the prior exam.
