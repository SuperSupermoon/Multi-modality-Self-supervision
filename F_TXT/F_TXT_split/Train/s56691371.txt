Compared to prior exam there has been removal of the upper enteric tube. Lung volumes are lower than prior examination on today's examination which accentuates the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vascularity. There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged without overt fluid overload or pulmonary edema. There is no focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
