The patient is rotated and lung volumes are low. The visible aerated portions of lung demonstrate no evidence for focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. No overt pulmonary edema is detected. Heart and mediastinal contours are unremarkable within the limitations of a rotated examination. A right neck catheter courses inferiorly with tip projecting over the expected location of the mid superior vena cava. Sternal wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.
