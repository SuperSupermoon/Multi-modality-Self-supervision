Fundic balloon of the ___ tube is well inflated, residing in the mid to distal stomach, and would need to be withdrawn 6 cm to reposition it in the fundus. ET tube is at the carina an should be withdrawn at least 2.5 cm. Lung volumes are quite low, decreased since ___, reflecting worsening atelectasis particular in the left lower lobe. Mild pulmonary edema is new. Small left pleural effusion is presumed. There is no appreciable effusion on the right or any pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is exaggerated very low lung volumes. Right jugular line ends close to the inferior cavoatrial junction.
