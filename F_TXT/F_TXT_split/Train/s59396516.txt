In comparison with a series of studies from ___, there is again hazy opacification of both hemithoraces, more prominent on the right, consistent with layering pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size. Pulmonary vascularity is difficult to assess due to the overlying pleural fluid. Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
