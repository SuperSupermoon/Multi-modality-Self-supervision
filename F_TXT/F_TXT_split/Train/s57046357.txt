The endotracheal tube is in correct position. A left Port-A-Cath with the tip in the right atrium. The nasogastric tube projects with its tip above the diaphragm in the postoperative residual esophagus. The line was placed on the surgery. An opacity overlying the central right lung is most consistent with a postoperative neoesophagus. There is mild pulmonary edema and a small bilateral pleural effusion. No focal airspace opacity. The low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette which is mildly enlarged. No pneumothorax.
