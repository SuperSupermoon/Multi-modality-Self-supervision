In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, 2 chest tubes remain in place in the left hemi thorax with a newly visible new small left apical pneumothorax. Moderate left pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size and may have a loculated component laterally. Left retrocardiac atelectasis persists. No other relevant changes.
