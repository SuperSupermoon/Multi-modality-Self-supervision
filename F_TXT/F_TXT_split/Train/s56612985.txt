AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. The Swan-Ganz catheter inserted through the right internal jugular vein continues toward the right ventricle and then continues towards the right main pulmonary artery and right interlobar pulmonary artery. Pulling back is recommended. The intra-aortic balloon pump is too high with its tip approaching the roof of the aortic arch and should be pulled back for approximately 2.5 cm. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Right basal atelectasis is present. No overt pulmonary edema is seen but upper zone redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature is noted.
