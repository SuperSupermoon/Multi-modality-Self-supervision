In comparison with the study of ___, a view of the upper abdomen shows the nasogastric tube extending to the upper portion of the stomach. The side-port appears to be just distal to the esophagogastric junction. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
