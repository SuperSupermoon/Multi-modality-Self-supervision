AP chest compared to 4:44 a.m.: Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the thoracic inlet, with the chin down. It could be advanced 2 or 3 cm for more secured seating. Leftward mediastinal shift indicates consolidation in the left lower lobe is largely atelectasis. New right transjugular Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the mid right pulmonary artery. Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Dual-channel left transjugular line ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion is presumed. Vascular congestion and perihilar opacification in the right lung is probably edema, but should be followed carefully to exclude developing consolidation or hemorrhage. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and distention of mediastinal veins, are comparable to the preoperative appearance earlier in the day.
