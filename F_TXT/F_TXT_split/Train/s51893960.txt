Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with areas of increased opacification involving the bilateral lung bases. Though the right basilar opacity has remained relatively stable since the prior examination, there has been progressive opacity at the left lung base. Though some of this may represent edema with atelectasis, underlying aspiration or pneumonia is not excluded. There are bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged since the prior examination.
