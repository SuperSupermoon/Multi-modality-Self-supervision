As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing gastric over distension has completely resolved. The left pleural effusion and the retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged. The appearance of the lung parenchyma is constant and there is no evidence for new focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. Moderate overinflation persists. The nasogastric tube should be slightly advanced by approximately 5 cm. The endotracheal tube continues to be in correct position.
