Interval placement of endotracheal tube, with tip terminating about 7 cm above the carina. This could be advanced a few centimeters for standard positioning. Widespread bilateral airspace opacities have progressed and are most confluent in the perihilar regions. The rapid progression and distribution favor pulmonary edema, especially in a patient with renal failure. Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary hemorrhage, severe infection and ARDS. Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured by the alveolar opacities but is not appreciably changed allowing for this factor. Small-to-moderate pleural effusions have increased.
