AP portable upright chest radiograph was obtained. Low lung volumes and slightly underpenetrated technique somewhat limits the evaluation. Allowing for this, there is no definite sign of pneumonia or overt CHF. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
