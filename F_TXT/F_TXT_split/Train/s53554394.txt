As compared to the previous radiograph from earlier today, a right pleural catheter has been placed with decrease in size of right pleural effusion, now moderate. No definite pneumothorax, but right lung apex is partially obscured and a small pneumothorax cannot be excluded. Exam is otherwise remarkable for improving aeration at the left lung base with residual small pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
