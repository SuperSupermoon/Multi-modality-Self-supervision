Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The lungs remain hyperinflated. Costochondral calcifications are again evident. There is evidence of multiple old rib fractures, particularly on the left. Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity most likely relates to atelectasis, although early consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The aorta remains calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is stable.
