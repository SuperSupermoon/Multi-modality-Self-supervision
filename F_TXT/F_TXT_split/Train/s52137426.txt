There is slight irregularity in the chest tube marker that might suggest kinking, please correlate with chest tube output. Right chest tube is in place, but the side hole is by the chest wall, thus advancement might be considered. Current study demonstrates no definitive evidence of pneumothorax. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. Left basal consolidation with pleural effusion and right pleural effusion are unchanged, but there is interval improvement of right basal atelectasis.
