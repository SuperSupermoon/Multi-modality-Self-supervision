Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis. A relatively radiodense 2 cm long opacity projecting over the right lower lung at the level of the anterior fourth rib needs further evaluation to exclude a small mass. A branching more or less cylindrical opacity in the left lower lung could be atelectasis and/or mucoid impaction. Cardiac silhouette is largely obscured by the elevated diaphragm. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. The upper abdomen is unremarkable. Radiodense material projecting at the thoracolumbar level is consistent with prior vertebroplasty.
