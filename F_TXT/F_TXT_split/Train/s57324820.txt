Comparison to ___. Improved ventilation at the lung bases. Pre-existing minimal interstitial opacities, notably at the bases of the right upper lobe, are decreased in extent and severity. No new opacities are noted. The right PICC line has been pulled back, the tip now projects over the subclavian vein on the right, repositioning should be considered.
