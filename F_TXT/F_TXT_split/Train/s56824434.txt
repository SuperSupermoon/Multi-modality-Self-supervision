Compared to the prior study, the radiopaque tip of the Dobbhoff type tube has retracted and now lies in the region of the GE junction. The proximal portion of the radiopaque segment probably lies proximal to the GE junction, within the lowermost esophagus. Otherwise, allowing for differences in positioning, I doubt significant interval change. Subtle bibasilar opacities remain visible.
