The tip of the endotracheal tube resides approximately 4.5 cm above the carinal. The endogastric tube extends into the left upper quadrant. On this supine radiograph, a partially layering moderate in size right pleural effusion is present. Given the layering right pleural effusion and increased opacity of the right hemi thorax, difficult to exclude a superimposed consolidation. The left lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette grossly unremarkable. Bony structures intact.
