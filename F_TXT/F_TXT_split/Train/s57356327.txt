A single supine portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates an ET tube with the tip terminating 1.3 cm from the carina which needs to be retracted 2-3 cm for appropriate positioning. An orogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the port in the expected location of the stomach. The inspiratory lung volumes are low. Retrocardiac opacification obscuring the left hemidiaphragm and left heart border may represent a developing infiltrate or atelectasis. Right base atelectsais is seen. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely assessed but maybe mildly enlarged. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.
