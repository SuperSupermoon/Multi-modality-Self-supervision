1. Interval placement of right chest tube with considerable, likely near- complete, reexpansion of the right lung. Lucency at the right lung base raises the question of possible small residual pneumothorax. 2. Minimal atelectasis/scarring at the left lung base. 3. ET tube ~19 mm above the carina, borderline low. Clinical correlation requested.
