A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates markedly low lung volumes with interval increase in the large left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis. There is pleural fluid tracking within the left major fissure. On the right, there is progressive elevation of the right hemidiaphragm consistent an intraabdominal process and basilar atelectasis. A heterogeneous opacity obscuring the right hemidiaphragmatic contour has been increasing since ___. There is no pneumothorax. The pulmonary vascularity is normal and there is no edema. The right internal jugular central venous line likely terminates within the right atrium, and should be withdrawn at least 2-3 cm to ensure proper positioning in the lower SVC.
