As compared to the previous radiograph, the chest tube has been clamped. The lung volumes have slightly increased, potentially indicating improved ventilation. There is no evidence of a right pneumothorax. On the left, the preexisting pleural effusion is unchanged. Unchanged left basal atelectasis and moderate cardiomegaly with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Unchanged position of the pacemaker leads, unchanged tracheostomy tube.
