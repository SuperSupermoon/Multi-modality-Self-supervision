There is significant rightward rotation of the patient on the current radiograph. Allowing for changes due to this, and low lung volumes, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits. The bilateral hila are within normal limits. There is mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Diffuse increased opacity in the right lung, centered in the right mid and upper lung, is concerning for pneumonia or sequelae of aspiration pneumonitis in the appropriate clinical setting. The left lung is clear. There is no left pleural effusion. It would be difficult to exclude a trace right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
