There is an ET tube approximately 4.5 cm from the carina as well as a right PICC line with tip terminating in the low SVC. There is also an upper alimentary tube coursing below the diaphragm with tip off the film. Cardiomediastinum and hilar contours are normal. Mild left lower lobe atelectasis is stable. The previously mentioned left upper lobe increased opacification is likely due to overlying structures.
