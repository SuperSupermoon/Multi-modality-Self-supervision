The endotracheal tube has its tip 5.5-6 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach. Once again, the left lower lobe has collapsed and there is hyperexpansion of the right lung. There may be a small layering left effusion. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Residual oral contrast is again seen within the splenic flexure.
