An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the level the carina. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in SVC. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Lung volumes remain low. The cardiomediastinal contour is diffusely enlarged, similar in appearance when compared to the prior study. Small left pleural effusion, unchanged compared to the prior study. Linear retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.
