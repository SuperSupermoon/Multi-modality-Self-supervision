Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the mid-to-distal right main pulmonary artery. ET tube tip is in standard position, 2.6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Large right pleural effusion is unchanged, associated with right lower lobe and right upper lobe atelectasis. There is a right IJ catheter sheath. There are drains in the upper abdomen, right and left. Multiple surgical clips are seen in the right upper quadrant.
