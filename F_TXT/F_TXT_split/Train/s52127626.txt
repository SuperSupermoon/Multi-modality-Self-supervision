AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 11:22 a.m.: Following placement of the right pigtail drain, there has been a substantial improvement in the volume of previously large right pleural effusion which was responsible for near- complete collapse of the right lung. Right upper lobe is now well aerated. Atelectasis is limited to the lower and some of the right middle lobe. A small volume of air is present at the apex and at the right lung base medially. Indwelling basal pleural drain unchanged in position. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion stable. Left upper lung clear. Cardiac silhouette hard to assess because of adjacent pleural effusion.
