1. Lung volumes remain diminished with patchy streaky opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis. There are stable small bilateral effusions, right greater than left. Vasculature does appear to be somewhat cephalized which likely reflects underlying pulmonary venous hypertension. However, no evidence of pulmonary edema. Biapical radiopaque nodular opacities may represent calcified granulomas given the presence of mediastinal calcified lymphadenopathy on a recent chest CT dated ___ consistent with prior granulomatous infection. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax.
