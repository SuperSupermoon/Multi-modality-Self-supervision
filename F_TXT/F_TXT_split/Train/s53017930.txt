The lungs are relatively hyperinflated. There appears to be external artifact overlying the lateral left lower lung base. There is patchy right basilar opacity. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle is seen which may be due to hyperinflated lung, however trace pleural effusion is not excluded. There is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is mild to moderately enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
