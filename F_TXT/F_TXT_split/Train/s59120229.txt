An endotracheal tube has been retracted slightly and now resides approximately 5 cm above the carina. There is a new left subclavian central venous catheter that terminates in the upper superior vena cava. An orogastric tube again courses through the mediastinum into the left upper quadrant. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Vague left mid lung opacity suspected on the prior study is less distinct, but there may be a developing retrocardiac opacity at the medial left lung base, where opacity appears somewhat denser. Patchy right basilar opacity is likely due to minor atelectasis and appears unchanged.
