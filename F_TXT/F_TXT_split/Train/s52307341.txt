In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is an placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular level, approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. The right IJ catheter is been pulled back with the tip now in the mid to lower SVC. Increased opacification at the right base most likely reflects atelectatic changes. Increasing atelectasis is also seen at the left base with mild blunting of both costophrenic angles. Nasogastric tube extends to the distal stomach. Incidental note is made of a cervical fusion device.
