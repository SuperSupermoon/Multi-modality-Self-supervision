AP chest compared to ___: Mild cardiomegaly is stable, but pulmonary vascular congestion has improved. Only pulmonary abnormalities are atelectasis in the right mid lung. I see no pneumonia. Pleural effusion small if any. Very radiodense ___-mm nodule left lower lung laterally is presumably a calcification.
