AP portable upright view of the chest. Lungs are clear though lucent and hyperinflated which likely reflect COPD. A tiny clip projects over the right upper lung. Scarring in the right lung apex appears slightly more conspicuous. No effusion or pneumothorax. No convincing evidence for pneumonia or edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Chronic left ribcage deformities noted.
