1. Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. The left chest tube remains in position. There is a small left apical pneumothorax which probably is not significantly changed given differences in positioning between studies. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is interval improvement in aeration of the left base with persistent focal patchy opacity at the right base. No evidence of pulmonary edema. There is some lateral right-sided pleural thickening as well as focal left apical pleural thickening unchanged.
