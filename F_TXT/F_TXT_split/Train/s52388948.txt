AP chest compared to 12:58 a.m.: New left pleural tube enters at the mid chest level and descends to the base. This is responsible for new subcutaneous emphysema in left chest wall. An increase in the medial collection of air suggests that this might be a pneumomediastinum rather than pneumothorax. Lung volumes are lower and this makes it difficult to exclude the onset of mild pulmonary edema. Atelectasis persists at the base of the right lung, but may have improved. There is no right pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Mild increase in heart size and caliber of mediastinal veins suggests an increase in right heart pressures. ET tube at the thoracic inlet is unchanged in standard position and a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach. Dr. ___ was paged at the time of dictation, 8:15 a.m.
