The heart size is top normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The lung volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. Coarse bibasilar interstitial opacities may represent new consolidations or aspiration pneumonitis. There is mild bronchial wall thickening in the central regions. There is no pneumothorax. A small right pleural effusion is present.
