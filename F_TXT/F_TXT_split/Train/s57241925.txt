Subcutaneous emphysema overlying the right lung makes it difficult to assess for subtle pneumothorax. The possibility of a small right apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded, particularly in light of a thin linear density along the superolateral right chest wall. There are also known bullous changes at the right lung apex. There is only mild patchy opacity at the right lung base, consistent with atelectasis. This includes changes in the right cardiophrenic region, which are slightly more pronounced than on the prior study. Equivocal minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Right pigtail catheter remains in place. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Left lung remains grossly clear, without CHF or focal infiltrate. Minimal subsegmental atelectasis or scarring at the left lung base. No gross effusion. Bullous change in the right paratracheal region. No obvious pneumothorax on the left.
