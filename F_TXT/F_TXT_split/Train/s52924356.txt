Since the prior radiograph performed earlier today, there has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube which terminates in the distal esophagus. As mentioned in a prior report, the left PICC again terminates at the brachiocephalic-SVC junction. The left hemodialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium. The lungs are free of focal consolidations, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Stable appearance of mild interstitial pulmonary edema. The rounded left perihilar density thought to represent an end-on view of a pulmonary vessel as described on the prior CXR is not well visualized on this study. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
