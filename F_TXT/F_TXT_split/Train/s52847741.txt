The patient is markedly rotated on today's study, this limits assessment. A dual lead pacemaker appears to be unchanged in position. A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC. The appearance of increased opacity in the right lung is likely in part due to projection, in part due to layering pleural effusion. The left lung appears grossly clear.
