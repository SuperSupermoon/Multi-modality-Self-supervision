Compared with the earlier study, no change in the positioning of the multiple support and monitoring devices. There appears to be a tiny 2-3 mm right apical pneumothorax, but without evidence of mediastinal shift. There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusions. Heart size is borderline, but unchanged.
