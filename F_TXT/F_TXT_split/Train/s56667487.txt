ET tube is approximately 3.8 cm above the carina in appropriate position. Feeding tube passes below the diaphragm with side port within the gastric body and tip within the gastric antrum. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable although mildly accentuated by low lung volumes. Bilateral low lung volumes with crowding of bronchovascular markings are noted. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax is present. There is no evidence of acute rib fractures. If there is concern for rib fractures, then dedicated rib radiographs should be obtained, directed to regions of physical findings.
