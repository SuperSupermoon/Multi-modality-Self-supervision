Left chest tube points towards the apex and appears unchanged in position. There is a lucency adjacent to the left heart border extending inferiorly deep into the left lateral sulcus. This is highly suggestive of an anterior pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Lungs are clear. No pleural effusions.
