Cardiac silhouette is normal in size. Pulmonary vasculature appears engorged, and there is a worsening combined alveolar and interstitial pattern with relative sparing of the extreme bases and lung periphery. Observed findings likely represent pulmonary edema, with or without coexisting multifocal infection. Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
