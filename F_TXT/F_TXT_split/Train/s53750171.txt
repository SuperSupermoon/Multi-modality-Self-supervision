A technically limited chest radiograph was obtained solely for placement confirmation of a Dobbhoff tube. The Dobbhoff tube terminates within the stomach. Within the imaged portion of the chest, there has been apparent worsening of pulmonary edema, but assessment is limited by patient rotation, differences in exposure between two studies and incomplete imaging of the right lung.
