The lungs are hyperexpanded. There is a possible developing opacity in the right mid lung zone. There is no pulmonary edema. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is likely due to the small pleural effusion, which was better assessed on the lateral chest radiograph from one day earlier. There is no definite left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. The slight apparent enlargement of the heart is likely due to the AP technique.
