As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone thoracocentesis on the left. There is substantial decrease in extent of the left pleural effusion. A linear opacity is seen at the left lung base, likely reflecting local atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax or other complications. The appearance of the left lung is not substantially changed. Lung volumes on the right have decreased and, as a consequence, the pre-existing right pleural effusion appears slightly more extensive. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
