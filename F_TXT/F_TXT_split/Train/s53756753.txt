Cardiac silhouette size appears mild to moderately enlarged with a somewhat globular configuration. Mediastinal contour is similar. The hila bilaterally are prominent, but this is unchanged from the previous examination. There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement without frank pulmonary edema. Dense retrocardiac opacity is new from the prior study. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
