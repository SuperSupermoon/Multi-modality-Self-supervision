AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 9:15 p.m.: The severe bilateral pulmonary consolidation which developed between 10:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. on ___ has not changed much. Previous moderate left pleural effusion is smaller. Sudden onset of heterogeneous opacification in both lungs can be due to a variety of factors, and it would be helpful to correlate the findings with the history of the patient's PEA arrest. At this point, sepsis, with or without septic emboli, and diffuse alveolar damage are the most obvious explanations. Heart is not particularly enlarged. Mediastinal veins are not engorged. ET tube, right PIC line, and an upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements. There is no pneumothorax. Of note, the nonphysiologic appearance of the left upper mediastinum in the region of the aortic arch has been stable since ___. It was normal on ___. Is there any reason to suspect an acute aortic syndrome or an upper mediastinal hematoma due to an attempted line placement? Findings were discussed with a house officer caring for the patient at the time of dictation.
