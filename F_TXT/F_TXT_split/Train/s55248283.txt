Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and accompanied by widening of the azygos vein and pulmonary vascular congestion. Multifocal areas of patchy and linear opacity are present in the left mid and both lower lung regions, with slight improved aeration at both lung bases. These findings favor a multifocal atelectasis, but co-existing aspiration or pneumonia is possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
