Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the low SVC. No pneumothorax is identified. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina, however, the balloon appears to be somewhat overinflated. The enteric tube tip again remains suboptimally positioned in the distal esophagus. Low lung volumes persists. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Persistent bibasilar opacities likely reflective of atelectasis are noted. No pleural effusion is present. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
