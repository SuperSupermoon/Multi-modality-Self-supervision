Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained. A left PICC line terminates in the mid SVC. There is evidence of a prior right mastectomy and axillary node dissection. The previous opacity at the right lung base has markedly improved, although a moderate right-sided pleural effusion remains. Left basilar atelectasis is unchanged with a possible small left pleural effusion. Previous moderate pulmonary edema has improved as well. The heart remains moderately enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with persistent prominence of the right mediastinum, consistent with known lymphadenopathy. There is no pneumothorax.
