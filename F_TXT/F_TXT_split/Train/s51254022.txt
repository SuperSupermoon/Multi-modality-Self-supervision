Right-sided PIC line terminates in the mid to low SVC. Overall, there has been interval improvement of the previously noted consolidation in the mid right lung. Linear opacity in the mid left lung may be secondary to atelectasis as well. Low lung volumes exaggerate the cardiomediastinal contours which are otherwise unremarkable. The aorta is mildly tortuous. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Improved pulmonary edema. Improved pleural effusions. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
