Lung volumes are low leading to increased prominence of the bronchovascular structures. Mild central vascular congestion is noted. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may represent a trace pleural effusion. There is no lobar consolidation, pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary interstitial edema. The heart appears mild-moderately enlarged but is suboptimally imaged. No displaced rib fractures visualized.
