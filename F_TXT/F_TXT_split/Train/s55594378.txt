As compared to the previous radiograph, a pigtail catheter was inserted into the right pleural space. The catheter has drained most of the pre-existing right pleural effusion. There is no clear evidence for postprocedural pneumothorax but the consolidations and rounded densities at the right lung apex, combined to several linear lucencies, persist in almost unchanged manner. Also unchanged are the perihilar right-sided consolidations, combined to surrounding parenchymal opacities. The course of the nasogastric tube is in unchanged position. The position of the bronchial stents is unchanged. The tip of the endotracheal tube is now projecting 2.5 cm above the carinal.
