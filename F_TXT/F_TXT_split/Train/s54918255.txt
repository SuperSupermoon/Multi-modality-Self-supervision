There is mild bibasilar atelectasis, greater in the left base than the right. Otherwise, the lungs are clear with no evidence of consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is at the upper limits of normal. The aorta appears somewhat tortuous. Cerclage wires are again noted overlying the posterior neck.
