Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance with a very large hiatal hernia present. Bibasilar areas of atelectasis are present, with interval worsening on the left, accompanied by small bilateral pleural effusions. Coexisting aspiration is also possible given the setting of a large hiatal hernia. There is no evidence of congestive heart failure.
