Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistence of a small left-sided apical pneumothorax. There has been interval resolution of the previously seen hypodensity at the left lateral chest wall, now this region is homogeneously opaque, and may represent reaccumulation of pleural fluid. Stable-appearing interstitial abnormality in the right lung may represent pulmonary edema versus dissemination of tumor. Status post CABG with median sternotomy wires in place.
