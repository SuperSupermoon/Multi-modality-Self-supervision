The heart is moderately enlarged. There is a convex contour to the right upper mediastinum that is most often due to tortuosity of the great vessels, although not entirely specific. Mild diffuse interstitial abnormality including prominence of upper zone pulmonary vascularity, which also appears indistinct, suggests mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy and medial left lower lung opacities suggest minor atelectasis. Surgical clips project along the left axilla. Moderate degenerative changes involve the right glenohumeral joint, which shows moderately large osteophytes.
