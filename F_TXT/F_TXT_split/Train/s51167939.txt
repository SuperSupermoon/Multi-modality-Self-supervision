Coinciding with interval drainage, the cardiac contour appears decreased although still mildly enlarged. It is partly obscured at the left and inferior portions by confluent left basilar opacification with a substantial pleural effusion, probably again moderate to large, with loculation, but similar to prior findings. Right paramediastinal and left hilar mass effect appears decreased as since the prior radiographs.
