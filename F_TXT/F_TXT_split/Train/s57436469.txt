Port-A-Cath unchanged residing in the right chest wall with catheter tip extending to the cavoatrial junction. The lung volumes are markedly low which limits the evaluation. There is subtle bibasilar opacity which could represent pneumonia though given the low lung volumes, bronchovascular crowding atelectasis may also contribute to this appearance. A tiny right effusion is likely present. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures are intact.
