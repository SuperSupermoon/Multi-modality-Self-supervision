AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size is normal. Mediastinum is normal. Lungs are essentially clear. Minimal opacity in the left mid and lower lung is noted, most likely reflecting atelectasis, but repeated radiograph preferably PA and lateral is recommended. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
