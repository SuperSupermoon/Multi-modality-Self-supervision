Lung volumes are low. Heart size is borderline enlarged with a left ventricular predominance, unchanged. The aorta is mildly tortuous. Hilar contours are unremarkable, and there is no pulmonary edema. Bibasilar patchy airspace opacities appear slightly progressed in the interval, which could reflect a combination of patient's known chronic interstitial lung disease with superimposed atelectasis, but progression of the patient's known chronic interstitial lung disease cannot be excluded. There may be a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
