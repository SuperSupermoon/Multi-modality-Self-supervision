AP chest compared to ___: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are larger accounting for increase in bibasilar atelectasis, most severe on the left, and although pulmonary vasculature is more engorged there is not yet pulmonary edema. Cardiac silhouette is obscured, but not substantially enlarged. No pneumothorax. Transvenous pacer lead follows the expected course to the right ventricular apex.
