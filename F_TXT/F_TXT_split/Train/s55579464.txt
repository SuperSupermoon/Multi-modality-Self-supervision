Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet approximately 6 cm above the carina. A single lead left-sided pacing device is in place with the tip terminating over the expected location of the right ventricle. The heart is enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Focal opacity in the mid to lower right lung would be concerning for aspiration or pneumonia, less likely pulmonary hemorrhage, given that the left lung is grossly clear. Clinical correlation is advised. No pulmonary edema or large effusions. No pneumothorax.
