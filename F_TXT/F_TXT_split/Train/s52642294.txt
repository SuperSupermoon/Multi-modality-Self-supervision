As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been slightly pulled back. The tube now is in correct position and projects 26 mm above the carina with its tip. The general appearance of the lung parenchyma with known parenchymal opacities and multiple monitoring and support devices has not changed. In the interval, the patient has also received an endotracheal tube. The tube shows normal course and the tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach.
