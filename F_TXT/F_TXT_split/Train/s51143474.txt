In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there are low lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Bibasilar opacifications probably reflect atelectasis and effusion, though on CT some of this could represent infarcted lung. In the right upper zone medially, there is opacification seen on CT to represent either pulmonary contusion or aspiration or infection. Monitoring support devices are unchanged. Some displacement of the cervical trachea to the left suggests thyroid enlargement.
