Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Large left pleural effusion has increased. Cardiomegaly cannot be assessed. Moderate-to-large right effusion has increased. Bilateral consolidations have worsened, mainly in the right upper lobe as before, this could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema but infection particularly in the right upper lobe is still in the differential.
