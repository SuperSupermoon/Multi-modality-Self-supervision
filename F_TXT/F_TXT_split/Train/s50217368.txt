Lordotic positioning. A linear density density seen in the soft tissues in the region of the left axilla and appears to extend up to the lateral border of the left chest wall. Detail is considerably obscured due to overlying soft tissues, even on the edge-enhanced images. No definite PICC line is seen within the thoracic cage and no PICC line is identified overlying the SVC. No obvious pneumothorax, though a small small pneumothorax could be obscured due to lordotic positioning. The heart is not enlarged. There is no CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.
