In comparison with the earlier study of this day, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina, and a left IJ catheter with the tip in the mid portion of the SVC. Opacification at the left base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is again seen, consistent with layering effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. The possibility of superimposed pneumonia would certainly have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is again seen, consistent with effusion or pleural thickening. Mild prominence of central pulmonary vessels could reflect mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
