In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the nasogastric tube has been repositioned with the tip in the upper body of the stomach and the side port probably just distal to the esophagogastric junction. The tube should be pushed forward several cm if possible. Right IJ catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC. The patient has taken a much better inspiration and there has been a substantial decrease in the atelectatic changes at the bases. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without appreciable vascular congestion.
