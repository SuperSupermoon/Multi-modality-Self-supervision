AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates right pneumothorax, moderate. It appears to be new since the prior study after discontinuation of the right chest tube. Left two chest tube are in place. There is questionable minimal apical pneumothorax on the left. Substantial enlargement of the descending thoracic aorta is redemonstrated and should be further monitored. Bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusion are noted.
