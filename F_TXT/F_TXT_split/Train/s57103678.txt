1. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. There continues to be diffuse bilateral airspace process with probable associated layering effusions. This may reflect worsening pulmonary edema, although superimposed bilateral pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable, but somewhat difficult to assess due to diffuse airspace process.
