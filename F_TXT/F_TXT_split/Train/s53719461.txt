There is an endotracheal tube seen with tip terminating at midpoint between the inferior aspect of the clavicle and the carina in adequate position. There is also an orogastric tube seen with tip coursing below the field of view of the image obtained. Mediastinal contours are within normal limits with the exception of pulmonary arterial enlargement. There is suture material projecting over the right lung. The bilateral pleural effusions and osseous sclerotic lesions are better assessed on the CT Torso examination. Overlying bowel gas pattern is nonspecific and no acute fractures are seen.
