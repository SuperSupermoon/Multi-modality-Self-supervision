There is moderate pulmonary edema. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette moderately enlarged. Again seen is left base opacity and obscuration of the left costophrenic angle, which could be due to pleural effusion and atelectasis, though underlying consolidation is not excluded. Partially imaged is left-sided pacer device. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle is seen and a trace effusion not excluded.
