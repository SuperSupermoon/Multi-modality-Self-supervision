Endotracheal tube terminates approximate 9 mm above the carina. Recommend withdrawal by approximately 1.5-2 cm for more optimal positioning. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the proximal stomach. Right greater than left perihilar opacities could be due to pulmonary edema versus aspiration, infectious process not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is subtle suggestion of linear calcification at the right diaphragm which could represent pleural calcification.
