Patient is slightly rotated during this examination. Lung volumes are slightly lower compared to ___. New bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis in the setting of lower lung volumes, but aspiration or infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. An oblong opacity in the right midlung could reflect linear atelectasis or fissural fluid. Pulmonary edema is mild and more pronounced on the left. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. No pneumothorax. Heart size remains moderately enlarged. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Multiple surgical clips are noted along the mediastinum. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
