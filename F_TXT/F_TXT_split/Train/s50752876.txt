Cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and worsening pulmonary edema. More confluent opacities at the lung bases could reflect dependent edema and atelectasis, but a co-existing aspiration or pneumonia is possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
