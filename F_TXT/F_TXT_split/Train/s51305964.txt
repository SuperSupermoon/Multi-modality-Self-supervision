1. Right internal jugular central line. Left subclavian introducer catheter and feeding tube are unchanged in position. There has been interval removal of the left basilar chest tube. There continues to be a small but stable left apical lateral pneumothorax given differences in positioning. The patient is status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which may reflect a small effusion or pleural thickening. No pulmonary edema. Patchy retrocardiac opacity likely reflects patchy atelectasis, although superimposed infectious process should also be considered.
