The lungs are somewhat hyperexpanded and suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Mild left basilar atelectasis is noted, but the lungs are without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Again noted is marked rightward deviation of the trachea at the thoracic inlet, similar to prior study and most likely representative of an underlying goiter. There is aortic tortuosity with calcifications of the aortic arch. Diffuse osteopenia is again noted. A clip is noted in right upper quadrant and consistent with history of cholecystectomy.
