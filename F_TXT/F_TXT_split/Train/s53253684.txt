Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There is persistent retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis and small pleural effusion. There has been slight interval improvement in the degree of right pleural effusion, which may be due to patient positioning. Pulmonary edema has resolved. The endotracheal tube ends 3.8 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view. A left-sided PICC line ends at the cavoatrial junction.
