As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. As a consequence, there is relatively massive atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung areas. Co-existing pneumonia, however, cannot be excluded. The increased radiodensity at the right lung base is likely the cause of decreased lung volumes. The patient has received a nasogastric tube in the interval. The tube shows a normal course, the tip is not included on the image. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
