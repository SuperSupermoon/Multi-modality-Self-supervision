As compared to the most recent chest x-ray of ___, there has been interval decrease in width of the mediastinum, which may be due to a combination of decreased vascular distention and technical differences between the exams. However, the mediastinum remains widened compared to baseline radiograph of ___. This appears to be predominantly due to distention of the azygos vein contour. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, likely due to known pericardial effusion demonstrated on recent CT of ___. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has decreased in size since recent chest radiograph. There is also a probable very small right pleural effusion. No visible pneumothorax. Considering history of chest and back pain and apparent clinical concern for aortic dissection, CT angiography would be recommended if this diagnosis is continuing to be entertained clinically.
