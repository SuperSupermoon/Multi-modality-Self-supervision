Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal SVC. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Interval improvement in aeration at the right lung base. Residual streaky opacity at the left base most likely reflects atelectasis, although early pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggestive of prior cholecystectomy.
