Endotracheal tube tip is 6 cm above carina at the level of the clavicles. Consider advancing the ET tube by 1-2 cm for better seating. Tip of right subclavian line ends at mid SVC. Opacification of the left lung base, unchanged since yesterday, can simply be explained by a combination of mild-to-moderate effusion and accompanying left lower lung atelectasis. Left upper lung and right lung are clear. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. No pneumothorax.
