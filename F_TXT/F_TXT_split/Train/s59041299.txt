Right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC. The cardiac silhouette remains mild to moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable. There is slight increase in interstitial markings bilaterally suggesting slightly worsened interstitial edema. Patchy opacities at the right lung base and lingula and left lower lung are more prominent as compared to the prior study and may relate to atelectasis, although an underlying infectious process may be present. No large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace right pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax.
