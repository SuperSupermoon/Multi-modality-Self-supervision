1. There continues to be bilateral patchy airspace disease with associated Kerley lines and indistinctness of pulmonary vasculature. These findings are most consistent with moderate pulmonary edema, although diffuse pneumonia should also be considered. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No evidence of pneumothorax. Small layering bilateral effusions. Superior displacement of right proximal humerus with narrowing of the acromiohumeral distance suggestive of chronic rotator cuff tear and associated degenerative changes. No acute bony abnormality. Overall, there is no significant interval change since the prior study.
