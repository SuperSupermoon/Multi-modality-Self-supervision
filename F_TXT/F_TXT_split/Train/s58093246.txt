Nasogastric tube has been withdrawn, now ends in the low esophagus and would need to be advanced at least 20 cm to move all side ports back into the stomach. Left lower lobe is still collapsed, moderate left pleural effusion unchanged. Right lung very low in volume but clear of any focal abnormality. Heart is top-normal size. No pneumothorax.
