Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and somewhat globular in appearance, which could be due to underlying pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
