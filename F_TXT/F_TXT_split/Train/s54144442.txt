Since the prior exam, there is increased pulmonary edema, which is now mild-to-moderate. There is increased left basilar atelectasis, though no focal airspace opacity to suggest a pneumonia. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, also increased in size since the prior exam. There is no pneumothorax. Calcifications are noted in the aortic arch. The heart is moderately enlarged, similar to prior exams. A left chest dual lead pacemaker device is unchanged.
