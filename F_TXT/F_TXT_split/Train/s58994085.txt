As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has developed bilateral pleural effusions of mild-to-moderate extent. In addition, bilateral increases in vascular diameters are seen, notably in the mid and lower lung zones and in the perihilar regions. The upper lung regions show signs of blood flow redistribution. Although the size of the cardiac silhouette has not substantially increased, findings are suggestive of pulmonary edema rather than of pneumonia or another pathology. If changes are not consistent with the clinical presentation, CT should be considered for further evaluation. The surgical fixation material and the ___ are in unchanged position. Previously placed drain in the mediastinum has been removed.
