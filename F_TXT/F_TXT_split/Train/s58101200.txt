Single portable view of the chest was compared to prior chest x-ray from ___ and CT chest from ___. Again seen is prominence of the interstitial markings consistent with chronic lung disease with most significant opacification in the right perihilar region similar to prior CT. There are, however, new areas of consolidation in the lungs bilaterally, particularly at the lateral aspect of the right mid lung and at the bilateral bases. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
