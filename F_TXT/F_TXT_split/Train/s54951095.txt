1. Increased interstitial markings right-greater-than-left. Possible slight improvement in the left upper and mid zones. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could reflect the presence of CHF, but the differential diagnosis includes other interstitial processes. Of note, the ___ chest CT shows evidence for chronic changes in lung that could contribute to this appearance. 2. No frank alveolar opacity. No gross effusion. 3. The opacity at the right base is somewhat more confluent -- probable atelectasis, but an early pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.
