Interval removal of the right chest tube with residual subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral chest wall soft tissues. There is a moderate right-sided effusion with some opacity at the right mid to lower lung which may reflect compressive atelectasis, although an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. The left lung is grossly clear, although diminished in volume. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient rotation on the current examination.
