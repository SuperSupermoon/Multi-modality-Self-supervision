Left basilar opacity may be due to combination of prominent fat pad and atelectasis. There is no large effusion, consolidation or edema. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there is tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Posterior left seventh and eighth rib fractures are again noted. Upper and lower thoracic vertebral body compression fractures are less well seen on the current exam.
