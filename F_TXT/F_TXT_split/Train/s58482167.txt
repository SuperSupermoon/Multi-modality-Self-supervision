As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.8 cm above the carina. The tube could be advanced by 1 cm. The other monitoring and support devices, including the right internal jugular vein catheter as well as the nasogastric tube are unchanged. Tip of the nasogastric tube is not included in the image. Multiple ECG cables overlay the thorax. The pre-existing parenchymal changes have decreased in severity and extent. Nevertheless, they are still clearly visible, in particular around the left hilus. Mild enlargement of the pulmonary vasculature suggests a combination of pneumonia and infection.
