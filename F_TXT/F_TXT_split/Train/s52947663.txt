Compared with ___, the effusion at the right base is larger and underlying collapse and/or consolidation is increased. Otherwise, allowing for technical differences, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is somewhat confluent opacity at the right lung apex and patchy opacity at the left lung base, similar to the prior study. No gross left effusion. Doubt CHF. Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged.
