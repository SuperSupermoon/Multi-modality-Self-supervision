In comparison with the study of ___, there is some increasing indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Hazy opacification is seen at both bases, more prominent on the right, reflecting layering pleural effusions with underlying compressive atelectasis of the lower lungs. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 6 cm above the carina. The tip of the nasogastric tube is difficult to assess and can only be definitely followed to the lower portion of the esophagus. An abdomen image would be helpful to demonstrate the tip of the tube. Right IJ catheter extends to the mid to upper portion of the SVC, with the left IJ catheter extending to the level of the carina.
