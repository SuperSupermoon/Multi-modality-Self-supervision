A right-sided PICC terminates in the axillary or subclavian vein. Cardiac pacemaker with appropriately placed leads is unchanged. Dense calcifications of the aortic knob are noted. The large calcified aneurysm of the left ventricle is again noted. Worsening interstitial abnormalities are compatible with pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusions are likely present as well.
