The ET tube has tip extending to 3.3 cm above the carina. A right-sided central venous catheter sheath and enteric tube traversing inferiorly out of view appear unchanged. There has been interval removal of a Swan-Ganz catheter. There is overall marked increase in cardiac size as compared to four days prior, even allowing for underlying cardiomegaly would suspect possible development of a pericardial effusion. The right lung is relatively well aerated. The left upper lung now demonstrates increased ill-defined opacity, suggestive of a combination of evolving pulmonary consolidation superimposed on layering pleural effusion. The retrocardiac opacity persists, which could represent atelectasis versus consolidation. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Multiple clips are seen projecting over the heart, suggestive of prior CABG.
