In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the PICC line is somewhat difficult to see, though it appears to be in the mid to upper portion of the SVC. The left and right hemidiaphragms are much more sharply seen. This could reflect improvement in pleural effusion or merely be a manifestation of a more upright position of the patient. Several dense streaks of atelectasis are seen in the mid zones bilaterally, and there is atelectatic change at the right base and possibly left base as well.
