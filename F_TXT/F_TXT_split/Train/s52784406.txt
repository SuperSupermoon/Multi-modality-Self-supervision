Endotracheal tube tip is 4.4 cm from the carina. Enteric tube passes below the inferior field of view. Additional catheter projects over the right chest, potentially a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The lungs are essentially clear noting linear left basilar opacity which is likely atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities.
