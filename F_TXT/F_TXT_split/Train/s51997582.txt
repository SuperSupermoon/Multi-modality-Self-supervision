Comparison to ___. The previously severe parenchymal opacity on the right has minimally decreased in extent and severity. Also decreased is a pre-existing right pleural effusion. The remaining opacities, both on the left and on the right, partly nodular and partly consolidated in appearance, are otherwise constant. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. The left Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position.
