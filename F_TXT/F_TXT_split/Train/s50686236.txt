Pigtail pleural catheter remains in place in the upper right hemithorax, with slight decrease in size of small to moderate right apicolateral pneumothorax. Other indwelling devices are similar in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Multifocal consolidative opacities in both lungs consistent with multifocal pneumonia appear relatively similar to the prior study except for slight worsening at the right lung base.
