A potential labeling issue was addressed in the preliminary wet read report. The endotracheal tube is in correct position. Interval worsening of left parenchymal opacities, presumably caused by progressive pneumonia or aspiration. The right lung is unchanged in appearance. Unchanged course of the nasogastric tube. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No pneumothorax.
