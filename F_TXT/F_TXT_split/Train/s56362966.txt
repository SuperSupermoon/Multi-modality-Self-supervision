Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. A right-sided PICC is again seen, terminating in the upper SVC. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged with a somewhat globular configuration and there may be underlying pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy. Left mid lung opacity is again seen, which may be post-surgical. There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm which may in part be due to overlying soft tissue; however, left base consolidation or atelectasis may be present. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation. The aorta remains calcified and tortuous.
