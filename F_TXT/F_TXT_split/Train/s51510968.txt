Comparison is made to a previous study from ___. There has been re-accumulation of the right-sided pleural effusion since the prior study. Part of the effusion is loculated along the right lateral chest wall. Moreover, there are again seen areas of consolidation within much of the left lung. This appears unchanged. No pneumothoraces are present.
