The cardiac silhouette is indistinct. Hazy perihilar opacities and ill-defined pulmonary vascular markings are consistent with pulmonary edema. Blunting of the costophrenic angles and basilar opacities are compatible with moderate-sized pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. Narrowing of the right acromiohumeral interval is consistent with rotator cuff injury. Deformity of the distal right clavicle is compatible with a prior injury at this location. Leads of a right chest wall pacer terminate over the right atrium and ventricle.
