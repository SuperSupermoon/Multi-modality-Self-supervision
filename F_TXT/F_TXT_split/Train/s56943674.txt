Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There has been interval development of an opacification at the right base, likely representing aspiration. Additionally, there is an area of increased opacification at the left base, which likely represents a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
