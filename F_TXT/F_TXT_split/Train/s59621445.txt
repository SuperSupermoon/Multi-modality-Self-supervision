AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained two and a half hours earlier. During the examination interval, a low-positioned left-sided pleural chest tube terminating in the left lateral sinus, has been removed. The chest findings remain completely unchanged and no evidence of pneumothorax is present.
