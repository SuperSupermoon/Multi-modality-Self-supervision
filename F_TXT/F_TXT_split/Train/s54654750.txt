In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube with its tip extending into the stomach. The side-port is at the level of the cavoatrial junction, and the tube should be pushed forward several cm for more optimal positioning. Opacification at the right base suggests volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. Less prominent changes are seen at the left base.
