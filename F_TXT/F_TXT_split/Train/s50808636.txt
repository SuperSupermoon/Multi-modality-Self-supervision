The lung volumes are normal. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Normal appearance of the hilar structures. At the left lung base, there is an area of increased density, that is likely reflecting atelectasis. However, aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded. In addition, a 1 cm homogeneous rounded structure is seen projecting laterally of the left heart border. The structure is unusually well defined and could represent an ECG attachment. However, the possibility of a pulmonary nodule cannot be excluded. Comparison with prior radiographs is strongly recommended. Should no prior radiographs be available, the presence of a nodule should be excluded with CT.
