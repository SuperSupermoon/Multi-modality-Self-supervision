1. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip likely within the proximal small bowel. A portion of an inferior vena caval filter is also seen. Interval extubation. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning between studies. Lung volumes remain low with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature and no definite airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
