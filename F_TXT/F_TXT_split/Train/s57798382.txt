As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The pre-existing right basal opacity, with potentially coexisting minimal pleural effusion, is constant. Constant size of the cardiac silhouette. No pulmonary edema. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base is slightly better visible than on the previous examination. No pneumothorax.
