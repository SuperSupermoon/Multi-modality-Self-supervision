The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal contours are normal. A right-sided internal jugular venous catheter tip sits within mid SVC. The lung volumes are low, accentuating the bronchovascular structures and causing mild bibasilar atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
