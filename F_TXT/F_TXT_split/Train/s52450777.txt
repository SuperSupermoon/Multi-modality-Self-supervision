As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The monitoring and support devices are constant, massive bilateral parenchymal opacities are unchanged in extent and severity. Only at the level of the right upper lobe, the parenchyma seems minimally less radiopaque. No new parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
