AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Asymmetry in opacification of both sides of the hemithorax is due to moderate right pleural effusion layering posteriorly and possible asymmetry in perihilar infiltration most likely due to pulmonary edema. Concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded, and particularly dense consolidation in the left lower lobe is due either to pneumonia or atelectasis. Heart is not particularly enlarged. Tip of the ET tube is no less than 35 mm above the carina. Right subclavian line ends low in the SVC. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper portion of a non-distended stomach. No pneumothorax.
