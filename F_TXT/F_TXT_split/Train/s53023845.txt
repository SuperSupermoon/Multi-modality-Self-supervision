The patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 2.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its distal course not imaged, however. The lung volumes are low. The left lung base is obscured by retrocardiac opacification which is nonspecific and can be seen with several etiologies, although commonly due to atelectasis. A left pleural effusion is suspected to coincide. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly prominent, including Kerley B lines visible at the right costophrenic sulcus, overall suggesting mild fluid overload.
