A portable AP upright chest radiograph shows streaky right perihilar opacity, somewhat improved compared to the most recent prior study of ___. The left retrocardiac atelectasis seen on that study is now clear. Note that there is no lateral view submitted. Some calcification is seen in the arch of the thoracic aorta. Cardiac size is normal and bones are unremarkable.
