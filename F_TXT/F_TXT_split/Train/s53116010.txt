Right chest tube is in place, with a tiny right lateral pneumothorax. Focal increased opacity is present in the right mid lung region adjacent to surgical chain sutures likely representing a combination of post-operative contusion and atelectasis. Additional foci of atelectasis are present at both lung bases. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique. Subcutaneous emphysema is noted in the right chest wall.
