Portable AP chest radiograph. Right-sided chest tube is kinked in several places. However, the pleural effusion on this side is decreased from radiograph obtained one hour prior. Hyperlucency around the tube is suspicious for pleural air that has been introduced from tube placement. There is no other significant interval change.
