an ET tube is in-situ, the tip is approximately 2.9 cm above the carina. An nasogastric tube is in-situ, the tip is not visualized the lies below the left hemidiaphragm. A right internal jugular catheter terminates near the cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes are slightly low with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. This resulting crowding of the pulmonary bronchovascular structures and likely accounts for the prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. No frank pulmonary edema is seen. No consolidation or pneumothorax. There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis. No definite pleural effusion.
