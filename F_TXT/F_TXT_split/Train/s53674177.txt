The lungs are well expanded with diffuse bilateral heterogeneous interstitial and alveolar opacities. A moderate-sized left pleural effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis is seen. The right pleural surface is normal. No pneumothorax. The heart is partially obscured by pleural effusion; however, is enlarged with mediastinal vein dilatation. Mediastinal contour is otherwise unremarkable and there is prominence of the hilum bilaterally. Sternotomy wires are unchanged in position and are intact. Right axillary clips, mitral annulus calcification, and valvular replacement are again noted.
