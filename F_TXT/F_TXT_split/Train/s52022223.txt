The lung volumes are slightly low, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature and heart size, which is mildly enlarged. There is hazy opacification in the retrocardiac region in the left lung. Linear scarring/atelectasis in the left mid lung is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax, overt pulmonary edema, or large pleural effusion. Changes related to prior median sternotomy and valve replacement are again noted.
