Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval intubation with ET tube terminating 3.5 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is coiled within the stomach. A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter has tip in the upper right atrium. The heart is normal in size. The lung volumes are low. There is mild pulmonary edema and right perifissural subsegmental atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Widened left upper mediastinum and obscured aortic knob would suggest aortic dissection in an older patient, or mediastinal hematoma after an attempted line placement, and need to be correlated with the clinical circumstances of this patient.
