Two right-sided chest tubes are in unchanged position, one oriented vertically and one oriented towards the base. Opacification at the right base is unchanged, consistent with prior surgery and a small amount of residual pleural fluid. Stable subcutaneous emphysema is present in the right upper abdominal wall. There is no definite pneumothorax. A small left pleural effusion and atelectasis is unchanged. There is no new consolidation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The aorta is tortuous. A right PICC terminates in the mid SVC and is unchanged.
