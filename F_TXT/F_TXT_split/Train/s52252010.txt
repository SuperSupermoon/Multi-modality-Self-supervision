Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 4.4 cm above the carina. The lung volumes are low which limits the evaluation with probable bronchovascular crowding at the lung bases. There is equivocal opacity in the left upper lung which may reflect patient rotation. No supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax. No definite bony abnormalities are seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is poorly assessed.
