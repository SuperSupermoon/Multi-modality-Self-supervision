Mild prominence of the mediastinum, likely a combination of patient position as well as azygos vein engorgement. Heart size is slightly enlarged compared to prior, which considered in conjunction with mild central pulmonary vessel engorgement suggests degree of mild heart failure. The opacification in the left lung base appears to correspond with prominent cardiac fat pad and eventration of the left hemidiaphragm evident on the ___ CT, but not significantly changed compared to prior radiograph. No pleural effusion identified, though left costophrenic angle is excluded from view. No pneumothorax evident.
