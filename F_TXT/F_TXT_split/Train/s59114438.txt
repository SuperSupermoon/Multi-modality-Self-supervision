In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification is unchanged and most likely represents atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Calcification of the mitral annulus is again seen. No convincing evidence of acute consolidation. Prominence of the right upper mediastinum most likely represents dilatation of brachiocephalic vessels.
