Examination is largely unchanged. Lung volumes are low. Again noted is a right internal jugular venous catheter in stable position. Endotracheal tube also remains in stable position. Transesophageal tube is suboptimally positioned in the distal esophagus. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is persistent bibasilar opacity, likely due to atelectasis.
