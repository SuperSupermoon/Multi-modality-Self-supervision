The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are remarkable. Lung volumes are lower compared to the prior exam, though the lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. No acute osseous abnormalities present. Well corticated ossific density lateral and superior to the right humeral head may reflect the sequela of previous trauma.
