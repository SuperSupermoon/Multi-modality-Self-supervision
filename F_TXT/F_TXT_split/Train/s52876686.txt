Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. Cardiac size is normal. Mildly widened mediastinum is stable. Left upper lobe medial consolidation has minimally increased. Right lower lobe consolidation is stable. Left lower lobe consolidation has increased. This is a combination of pneumonia, pleural effusion and increase in component of atelectasis. Left peripherally inserted catheter now projects in the left brachiocephalic vein. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Lingular consolidation is grossly unchanged. There is mild pulmonary edema.
