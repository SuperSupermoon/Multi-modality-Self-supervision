AP upright portable chest radiograph provided. The lung volumes are low, which limits the evaluation. There is subtle opacity at the left lung base, which could represent crowding of bronchovasculature/atelectasis, though an early pneumonia is not excluded. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear. No effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable, though rotation limits evaluation. No bony abnormality.
