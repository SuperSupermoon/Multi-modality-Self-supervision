Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. A right subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC. A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the proximal right pulmonary artery. A feeding tube terminates in the stomach. Stable retrocardiac airspace opacification is most likely due to subsegmental atelectasis. Marked cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged. There is minimal pulmonary edema if any. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
