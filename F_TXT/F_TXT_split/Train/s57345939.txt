In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the upper stomach. The side port is probably just distal to the esophagogastric junction. In comparison with the previous study, there is increased opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with layering effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Less prominent changes are seen at the right base.
