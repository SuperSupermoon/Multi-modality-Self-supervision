Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm from the carina. An apical right chest tube is in unchanged position. No pneumothorax is identified. There is substantial volume loss in the right lung evidenced by shift of the mediastinum to the right and an additional new opacity in the right upper lobe may be the sequela of collapse. The left lung is essentially clear. Adjacent to to the mediastinum is noted as a lucent sliver consistent with air tracking along the right heart border.
