Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach. Moderate pulmonary edema appears slightly worse in the interval with increased perihilar and right basilar alveolar opacification. More focal consolidative opacities in the lung bases raises concern for superimposed aspiration. There is continued moderate cardiomegaly. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Remainder of the examination is unchanged. There is re- demonstration of remote left-sided rib fractures. There is mild gaseous distension of the stomach.
