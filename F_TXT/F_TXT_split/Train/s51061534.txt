The previous right IJ central line and feeding tube have been removed. There has been attempted placement of a new feeding tube whose tip and side port are within the esophagus. This should be readjusted and could be advanced 20 cm for more optimal placement. Heart size is upper limits of normal. There is some atelectasis at the lung bases. There are no pneumothoraces.
