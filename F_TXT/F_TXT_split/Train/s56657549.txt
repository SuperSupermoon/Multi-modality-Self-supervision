Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Relative increased opacity at the right lung base could be due to underlying infection or aspiration. If the patient is able, PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation. Left lung clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
