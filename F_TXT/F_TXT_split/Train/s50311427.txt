AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The ET tube tip is approximately 6 cm above the carina. The new hemodialysis catheter inserted through right internal jugular approach terminates at the level of low SVC but potentially right atrium, difficult to assess on the current study. The NG tube passes below the diaphragm. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Overall due to underpenetration, precise details are difficult to assess.
