Single erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Study was made available for my interpretation, today, ___ at 11:30 a.m. Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in the interval with likely small effusions remaining, particularly on the right. Possible fluid tracking in the minor fissure. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. The mediastinal contours are stable. Evidence of old left-sided rib fractures is again seen.
