An esophageal catheter with a small radiodense tip is present terminating in the lower thoracic esophagus. This may correspond to the history of esophageal balloon placement. Additionally, an indwelling nasogastric tube or feeding tube is present, with the tip extending below the diaphragm into the stomach but not fully imaged on this radiograph. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by mild to moderate perihilar edema, bilateral pleural effusions and retrocardiac atelectasis.
