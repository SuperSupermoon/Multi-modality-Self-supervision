The exam is somewhat limited by low lung volumes and lordotic positioning. Within this limitation, the cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contour is stable. Mild widening of the mediastinum is unchanged and corresponds to mediastinal lipomatosis on prior CT. Again appreciated is a right-sided Port-A-Cath with the tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted. There is no effusion or pneumothorax. No acute bony change is identified.
