As compared to ___, severe leftward patient rotation limits assessment of cardiomediastinal contours. Apparent worsening opacification of left hemi thorax, likely a combination of increasing left effusion and worsening collapse, but a repeat nonrotated radiograph would be helpful to better quantify these processes. In the right lung, note is made of a persistent small to moderate right pleural effusion and slight improvement in adjacent right basilar lung opacity.
