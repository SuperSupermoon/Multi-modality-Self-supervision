A small amount of aerated lung is seen in the left chest laterally. A few air bronchograms are visualize. Otherwise, the left chest is opacified. There continues to be mediastinal shift to the left indicating that the left lung is at least partially collapsed. The more distal trachea and proximal left mainstem bronchus are now aerated, which is improved compared to the prior study however, the right mainstem bronchus is poorly visualized as are the more distal left-sided airways. There continues to be hazy opacity projecting over the right lung. Is unclear how much of this is due to patient's soft tissue or if there is an effusion layering posteriorly or and alveolar infiltrate on the right.
