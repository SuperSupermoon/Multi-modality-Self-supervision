A single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.1 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the proximal stomach. The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. Given this, there may be minimal left base atelectasis. No focal consolidation is seen. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
