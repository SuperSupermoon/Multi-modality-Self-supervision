The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is increased retrocardiac density compared to the prior study which suggests atelectasis however infection should be considered. There are no large pleural effusions identified. Scattered pulmonary opacities are seen throughout the bilateral lungs which may be related to persistent edema or a chronic interstitial process. No pneumothorax is identified. Pleural calcifications are seen and are unchanged from the most recent prior study.
