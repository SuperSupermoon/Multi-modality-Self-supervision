Right internal jugular central venous catheter has been removed. Since the prior exam, the bilateral pleural effusions have increased in size compared to the prior study, appearing moderate to large in degree. There is worsening opacification within the lung bases which could reflect compressive atelectasis though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded. Mild pulmonary edema is also present. There is no pneumothorax. Aortic arch calcifications are present. Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of bilateral pleural effusions, but likely mildly enlarged.
