There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube whose tip is 7 cm from the carina, between the clavicular heads. Enteric tube passes below the field of view with side-port past the GE junction. Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs suggestive of emphysema with superimposed interstitial edema. Nodular opacity again projects over the anterior right fifth rib. There is no focal consolidation. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the arch.
