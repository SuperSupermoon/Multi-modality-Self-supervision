There are likely tiny bilateral pleural effusions. Lung volumes remain diminished and there are patchy bibasilar opacities favoring atelectasis, although an early pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Clinical correlation is recommended. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
