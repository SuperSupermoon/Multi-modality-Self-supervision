AP upright portable view of the chest was provided. There is scarring in the right mid-to-lower lung with pleural thickening, similar to prior CT scan. Pleural thickening and scarring at the left lung base is also similar to prior, likely accounting for the blunted appearance of the bilateral CP angle. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF. No pneumothorax. There is an old deformity of the left clavicular mid shaft. No acute bony abnormalities.
