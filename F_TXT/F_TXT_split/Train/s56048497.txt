The cardiac silhouette size is normal. Aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Patchy opacities within both lung bases likely reflect aspiration or small airways infection, better seen on the recent CT. Small right pleural effusion is also better demonstrated on the recent CT. No pneumothorax is seen. Large amount of pneumoperitoneum is demonstrated.
