The AP chest radiograph was compared to ___. New tracheostomy has been inserted with its tip being 6.5 cm above the carina. Surgical material is placed over the superior portion of the tracheostomy tube. Since the prior radiograph, there is interval development of right upper lobe opacity most likely representing atelectasis as well as potentially pleural effusion. Re-evaluation of the patient is recommended. The aspiration cannot be also excluded in particular in the lower lungs. No pneumothorax is seen.
