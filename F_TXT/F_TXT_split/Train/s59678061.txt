Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Slight improvement in extent of pulmonary edema. Previously described left lower lobe consolidation has partially improved. Cavitary lung lesions demonstrated on CT of ___ are partially obscured by the overlying edema on the current radiograph, but a few scattered rounded lucencies probably represent residual foci of cavitation in this patient with previous history of multifocal necrotizing pneumonia. Peripheral lucency in right mid and lower lung region is unchanged and suggestive of a loculated pneumothorax.
