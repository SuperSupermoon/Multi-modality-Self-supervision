1. Multiple lines and tubes as described. ET tube appears to have been removed. The side port of the NG tube overlies the lowermost chest. 2. Prominence of the right paramediastinal soft tissues presumably postoperative. There is more focal prominence of the soft tissues about the chain sutures on the current exam, of indeterminate significance.If there were concern for hematoma, this would be difficult to exclude. 3. No obvious pneumothorax detected. 4. Worsening left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 5. Slight decrease in the degree of inspiratory volume may account for hazy density, but this may also reflect some increased atelectasis and vascular plethora. 6. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle without gross effusion.
