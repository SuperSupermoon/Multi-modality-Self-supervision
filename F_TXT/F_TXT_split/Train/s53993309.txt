Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. Again, as mentioned on the prior study, lucencies are seen projecting over the left lung base, which could potentially represent spared lung, however, recommend continued follow up. Consider dedicated PA and lateral views when the patient able or even cross-sectional imaging. Lingular opacity may represent combination of pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or atelectasis, although consolidation is not excluded. Right basal opacity persists but is improved in the interval. There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette remains top normal to mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable. There has been interval removal of a right-sided PICC.
