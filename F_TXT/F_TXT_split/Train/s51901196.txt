Small to moderate bilateral layering nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion, and relatively mild subpleural atelectasis were seen at both Lung bases on ___. Greater opacification at both lung bases than on ___ suggests that both pleural effusion and lung abnormalities have increased. Nevertheless I can't say whether the lung findings are due to greater atelectasis alone or pneumonia. Even though the patient has chronic moderate cardiomegaly, the upper lungs however have no findings to suggest that pulmonary edema is present, specifically no vascular engorgement.
