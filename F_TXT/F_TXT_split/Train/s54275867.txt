As compared to prior chest radiograph from earlier this morning, there has been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter with its tip terminating at the mid to lower SVC. There is no definite pneumothorax. An endotracheal tube terminates 8 cm above the carina. Enteric tube is in unchanged position. Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion persist. Left lower lobe opacity could reflect atelectasis, however, a superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
