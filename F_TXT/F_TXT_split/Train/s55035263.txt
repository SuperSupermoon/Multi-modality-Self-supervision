The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to marked patient rotation on the current study, although the patient reportedly has mediastinal lymphadenopathy on a recent chest CT. Overall, the appearance of the lungs does not appear changed with parenchymal distortion and scattered opacities suggestive of underlying emphysema and known metastatic disease as demonstrated on chest CT dated ___. A superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. A soft tissue mass associated with a lytic left fourth anterior rib lesion is again seen consistent with known metastatic renal cell carcinoma. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Left costophrenic angle is not entirely included on the study. .
