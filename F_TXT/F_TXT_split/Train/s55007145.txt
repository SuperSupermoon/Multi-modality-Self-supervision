The expiration view was obtained on the instructions of the requesting physician. This may account for the apparent increase in size of the small right pneumothorax which, in reality, may be unchanged. It may also exaggerate the confluence of the previous consolidation in the right lower lobe due to local bleeding. I have discussed the advisability of retaining of obtaining full inspiratory chest radiographs hereafter. Interval increase in heart size and mediastinal venous caliber is due in part to lower lung volumes, but most likely increased intravascular volume as well. Left lung is clear and there is no left pleural abnormality.
