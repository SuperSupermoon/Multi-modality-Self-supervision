CHEST (PORTABLE AP) An ET tube is present, the tip lies approximately 16 mm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. There is a possible second tube lying adjacent to the NG tube, not well demonstrated on these views. A right IJ central line is present -- given the degree of mediastinal rotation, its extent is difficult to determine. Increased retrocardiac density and also vascular crowding at the right lung base with minimal right costophrenic angle blunting are unchanged.
