The endotracheal tube terminates 3.1 cm above the carina. An enteric tube courses into the stomach. A right internal jugular catheter traverses into the low SVC. A left pectoral pacemaker is noted with leads in standard position. Orthopedic hardware within the left humerus is partially imaged. There are bilateral multi focal opacities, compatible with pneumonia. There is likely an element of superimposed pulmonary edema given the perihilar prominence and small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. A small amount of fluid tracks into the minor fissure. Mild cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax.
