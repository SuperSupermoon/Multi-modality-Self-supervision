As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The pigtail catheter in the left pleural space remains. On today's examination, a millimetric left apical pneumothorax is noted. Bilaterally at the lung bases, the known parenchymal opacities, dominated by a nodular pattern, are unchanged. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged course of the right pectoral Port-A-Cath. The areas of intestinal distention persist.
