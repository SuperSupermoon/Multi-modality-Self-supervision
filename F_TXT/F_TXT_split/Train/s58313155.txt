In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. There is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with low lung volumes. Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Poor definition of the lateral portion of the hemidiaphragm with hazy opacification at the base suggests layering pleural effusion. Poorly defined pulmonary vessels are consistent with some elevation and pulmonary venous pressure.
