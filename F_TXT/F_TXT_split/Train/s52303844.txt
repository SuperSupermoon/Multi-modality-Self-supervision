1. Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position having its tip approximately 1.5 to 2 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular central line, right subclavian central line and feeding tube are likely unchanged in position, although the tip of the feeding tube is not identified on the current study. The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated. Overall, lung volumes remain low. There is persistent patchy opacity at the right base most likely representing partial lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Probable layering right effusion. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given differences in patient positioning and rotation. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
