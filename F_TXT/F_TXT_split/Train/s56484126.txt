AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination obtained three hours earlier during the same day. During the interval, a small caliber pigtail end catheter has been introduced through the lower lateral chest wall, projects on the single view examination to terminate in the mid portion of the hemithorax projecting just slightly above the left hilum. The usual circular tail of the catheter has been stretched and elongated. The position of the fiducious marker is unaltered and there is no evidence of any new pneumothorax.
