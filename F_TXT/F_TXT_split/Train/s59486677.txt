AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The exam is somewhat suboptimal due to underpenetration due to patient body habitus. The lung bases are relatively underpenetrated due to overlying soft tissue. Bibasilar opacities are seen, which could relate to the overlying soft tissue, although infection or aspiration is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. There is mild prominence of the hila which may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement.
