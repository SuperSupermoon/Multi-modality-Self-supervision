Interval placement of an orogastric tube which courses past the diaphragm and out of view with distal tip returning into view, pointing superiorly near the gastroesophageal junction. Moderate pulmonary edema and pleural effusions are likely stable given differences in positioning and layering of effusions obscuring the hemidiaphragms. Volume loss in the left lower lobe is stable. Right internal jugular central venous catheter appears kinked near the entrance into the skin which may be due to projection or kinking of the catheter. Support lines are otherwise unchanged.
