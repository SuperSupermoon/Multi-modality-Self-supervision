The previously noted small right pleural effusion has decreased in size compared to the prior exam with only a trace amount of residual fluid noted. Adjacent atelectasis in the right lower lobe is re- demonstrated, but improved. No definite pneumothorax is detected. Remainder of the chest is unchanged. Left lower lobe mass is again noted. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Hyperinflation of lungs with attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices is compatible with emphysema.
