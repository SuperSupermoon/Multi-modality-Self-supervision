Cardiac size is unchanged. The mediastinum is widened and appears unchanged from prior. There are large pleural effusions bilaterally with atelectasis at the lung bases. There is a consolidation in the left perihilar region which has markedly worsened when compared to prior examination and is likely due to worsening pneumonia. Opacities in the right upper lobe are grossly unchanged. A questionable small pneumothorax is seen in the left apex. Esophageal stent and port A catheter are unchanged in position. Tubular structure projecting within the cardiac region is consistent with a pericardial drain.
