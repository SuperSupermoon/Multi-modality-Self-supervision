Assessment is limited due to positioning. Low lung volumes. No focal opacities. Apparent round nodule in the area of the right hilum is felt to represent a vessel on end and not a pulmonary nodule or hilar adenopathy. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion pneumothorax.
