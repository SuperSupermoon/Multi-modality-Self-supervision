As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube has been removed. The extent of the pleural effusion is constant. There is no interval appearance of pneumothorax. The other lung parenchymal and pleural opacities on the right are minimally decreased. On the left, there is constant retrocardiac atelectasis but slightly improved ventilation of the upper and mid portions of the lung. The size of the cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged.
