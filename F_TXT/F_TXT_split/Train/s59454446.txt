Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC, similar from prior. Lung volumes remain low. Heart size is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is re- demonstrated, and mild pulmonary vascular congestion may be present. Patchy opacities in the lung bases are compatible with areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
