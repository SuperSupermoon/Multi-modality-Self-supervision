An endotracheal tube is present 3.3 cm from the carinal. A left PICC is present with the tip in the mid SVC. Since the prior exam, mild pulmonary edema has developed. There has been little change in the peripheral nodular airspace opacities. No new opacity is identified. Tiny bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are normal. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. A radiopaque marker overlying the left upper abdomen is of uncertain etiology, and may be outside the patient.
