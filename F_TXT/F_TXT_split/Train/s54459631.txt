Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. A subtle nodular opacity projecting over the anterior right first ribs measuring 1.1 cm and appears to have a lucent margin, suggesting that it is outside the patient. Recommend clinical correlation for external artifact or any skin markings (mole/sking tag) at this site. Suggest repeat radiograph with marker overlying any skin tags and oblique views to exclude a pulmonary nodule. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragm. There are multiple air distended loops of bowel, partially imaged.
