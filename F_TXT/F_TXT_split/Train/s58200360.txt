In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been substantial worsening of the pulmonary edema. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with layering pleural effusions and compressive basilar atelectasis, more prominent on the right. The multiple left rib fractures are much better evaluated on CT. No evidence of pneumothorax. In view of the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
