Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. There continues to be a layering right effusion and a smaller left effusion with associated bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Incidental note is made of an azygos lobe. Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet approximately 6.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. No pneumothorax.
