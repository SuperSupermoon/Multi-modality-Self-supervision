Lung volumes are lower compared to the prior study, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. With this limitation in mind, there is stable cardiomegaly, accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral interstitial edema. Overall severity is probably similar to the prior study allowing for lung volume differences between the exams. Known mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy are shown to better detail on recent CTA of the chest of ___. Bibasilar lung opacities show continued improvement since ___, and may have represented a dependent pulmonary edema in this patient with known upper lobe emphysema, or potentially an aspiration event. Infectious pneumonia is considered less likely given the rapid improvement, but continued radiographic followup would be helpful to document resolution.
