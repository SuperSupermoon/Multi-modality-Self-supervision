Large mass contiguous with aortic arch is consistent with known aortic arch pseudoaneurysm and appears grossly unchanged. Stable cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion. Overall improvement of heterogeneous opacities in the right lung, now most pronounced in the right lung base, possibly due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema. Left retrocardiac opacity has slightly worsened, small left pleural effusion has slightly increased, and right pleural effusion has decreased in size. No visible pneumothorax.
