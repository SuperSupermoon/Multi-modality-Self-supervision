The heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with convexity at the right cardiophrenic angle compatible with known lymph nodes, unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema. Moderate to large left and small right pleural effusions have increased in size compared to the previous exam. Left basilar opacification may reflect compressive atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. Multiple nodules are demonstrated throughout the right lung, the largest within the right lower lobe measures 1.9 cm and is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
