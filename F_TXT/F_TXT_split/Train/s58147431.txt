Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is an endotracheal tube with distal lead tip at the level of the aortic knob. There is a feeding tube whose side port is at the level of GE junction. There is a right-sided central line with distal lead tip at the distal SVC. There are again seen diffuse air space opacities throughout both lung fields. This can represent a combination of pulmonary edema with pneumonia. Overall, this remains stable. Heart size is enlarged. There are again seen small bilateral pleural effusions. Degenerative changes and scoliosis of the spine is seen.
