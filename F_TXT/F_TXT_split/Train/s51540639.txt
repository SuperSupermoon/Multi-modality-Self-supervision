In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the upper stomach, with the side port probably just distal to the esophagogastric junction. No evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
