As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral pleural effusions have markedly increased in extent. This causes increased radiodensity of both the left and the right lung. Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac and right basilar atelectasis persist. No change in appearance of the pulmonary vasculature. No pneumothorax.
