The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar, allowing for differences in technique. There is a persistent opacity along the left lower lung, probably within the lingula, but improved somewhat. Opacities in the right mid and lower lungs persist with little if any definite change, allowing for differences in technique. The chronicity of these is uncertain. Moderate rightward convex curvature is centered along the lower thoracic spine.
