The lungs are normally slightly hyperexpanded. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. There is no definite evidence of pneumonia. The heart is exaggerated by AP technique and likely top normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Median sternotomy wires appear intact. Anterior cervical fusion hardware is incompletely evaluated on this study.
