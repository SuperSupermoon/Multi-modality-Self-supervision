Compared to the study from the prior day, the pulmonary edema appears worse. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is volume loss at both bases. There is hazy alveolar infiltrate bilaterally. There is pulmonary vascular re-distribution. The ET tube, left-sided PICC line, feeding tube with tip coiled in the stomach, sternal wires, and mediastinal clips are unchanged.
