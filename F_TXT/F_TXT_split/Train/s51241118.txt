Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position. There are patchy bibasilar opacities which are not significantly changed and may reflect bibasilar atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. A layering left effusion is again noted. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-erect technique. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
