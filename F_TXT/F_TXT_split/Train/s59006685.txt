There is no air in the upper mediastinum. At the level of the gastric pull-up, the difficult to detect pneumomediastinum and separated from the gastric folds and adjacent atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Lungs are clear and the heart is normal size. If symptoms persist and there is clinical concern for perforation, I would recommend CT scanning or fluoroscopically observed contrast swallow.
