Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax with interval development of pneumothorax. The pigtail catheter appears to lie in the expected location of the pleural space. There is increase in the degree of rightward tracheal deviation. Diffuse left lung opacities consistent with disseminated tumor as seen on the CT of the chest obtained at the same time. There is no left-sided pneumothorax or effusion.
