Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The aorta is tortuous, and the mediastinal and hilar contours are similar compared to the previous study. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Paraseptal emphysematous changes, most pronounced within the right upper lobe, are also re- demonstrated along with lung hyperinflation. Streaky opacity is noted in the right lung base. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Osseous structures remain diffusely sclerotic compatible with known metastatic disease.
