As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient was extubated and has received a tracheostomy. The position of the tracheostomy tube is unremarkable. Slightly increased retrocardiac atelectasis. Otherwise, the bilateral areas of basal atelectasis are unchanged. No other pathologic findings. The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
