The endotracheal tube has been withdrawn, with tip lying approximately 6 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is new in the interval with tip in the stomach. Right internal jugular central venous catheter has been placed in the interval with tip in the proximal right atrium. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Remainder of the examination appears relatively unchanged. There is continued mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar atelectasis/collapse is present though infection cannot be excluded.
