An endotracheal tube is in standard position, 2 cm above the level of the carina. There has been interval placement of a nasoenteric catheter with the tip incompletely imaged, though below the diaphragm. Basilar predominant coarse reticular and ground-glass opacities are unchanged compared to most recent prior despite diuresis as well as bilateral ground glass opacities. Given diffuse abnormalities seen on chest CT from 6 month prior, radiographic findings are likely chronic and related to either chronic PCP or ___ ___ lung disease. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
