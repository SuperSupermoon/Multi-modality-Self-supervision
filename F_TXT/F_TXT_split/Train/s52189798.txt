In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again extensive opacification in the left mid and lower zone consistent with substantial volume loss and probable pleural effusion. The area of possible lucency laterally in the mid zone appears to now be filled with pleural fluid. Right lung is essentially clear. Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
