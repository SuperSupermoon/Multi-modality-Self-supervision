1. Right chest tube with its tip near the right apex. Right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the mid superior vena cava. Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 2. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema. No obvious large pneumothorax on this supine film, although the sensitivity is diminished given supine technique. Patchy opacity at the left base most likely reflects atelectasis, although an early pneumonia cannot be excluded. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
