A portable upright frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right PICC terminating in the low SVC. Lung volumes remain low, with extremely limited visualization of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is unchanged mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis. No new focal consolidation or large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable, other than lower abdominal tubes which are incompletely imaged.
