Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. Again seen is extensive retrocardiac atelectasis and extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms. Overall the appearance is not significantly changed from the prior study dated the same day. An endotracheal tube ends 4.3 cm from the carina. An enteric feeding tube courses into the stomach with the last side port below the GE junction. There is no pneumothorax. Calcified hilar lymph nodes are suggestive of prior granulomatous infection.
