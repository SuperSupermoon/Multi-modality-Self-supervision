AP chest compared to ___: Severe symmetric pulmonary consolidation has worsened in the lower lungs since yesterday. At least a small right pleural effusion is present, probably unchanged. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements. The nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal and there is no mediastinal venous engorgement. I suspect the severe pulmonary abnormality is due to a combination of widespread multifocal pneumonia and concurrent non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
