In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with elevated pulmonary venous pressure and left basilar opacification consistent with volume loss in the lower lobes and small pleural effusion. Central catheter tip extends to the mid portion the SVC. No evidence of free intraperitoneal gas, though again this is not a true upright image.
