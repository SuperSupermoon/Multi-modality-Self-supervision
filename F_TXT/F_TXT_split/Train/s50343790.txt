Single portable view of the chest. There is persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle compatible with small residual pleural effusion, not significantly changed. The size of the right apical pneumothorax is also unchanged. Bilateral calcific densities projecting over lungs and the diaphragms are compatible with calcified pleural plaques. Increased density seen projecting over the right lower lung similar to prior may also represent loculated fluid. There is no new confluent consolidation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but stable. Atherosclerotic calcifications again noted at the aortic arch. Surgical clips project over the neck on the left. Hiatal hernia is again noted.
