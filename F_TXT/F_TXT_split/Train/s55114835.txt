Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged, accentuated by the presence of low lung volumes. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Mediastinal contour is widened superiorly, and this is likely attributable to supine positioning. There are diffuse alveolar opacities, with vascular indistinctness suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Extensive degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint are noted, with moderate degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint also demonstrated. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
