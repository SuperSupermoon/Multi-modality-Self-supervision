Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged. A moderate size hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated. The aorta is diffusely calcified and mildly tortuous. Tortuous right subclavian artery accounts for the prominent right paratracheal contour. Hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Contrast from recent CT examination is noted within the collecting systems bilaterally.
