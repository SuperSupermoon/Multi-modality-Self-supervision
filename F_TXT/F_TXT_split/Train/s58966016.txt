No apical pneumothorax is seen, although there appears to be a small amount of loculated air in the right costophrenic angle. Multiple right-sided rib fractures again identified. A few streaky opacities at the right base have improved suggesting resolving atelectasis. Left lung remains clear. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pulmonary edema.
