Left lower lobe collapse present for several days, unchanged, could be largely responsible for respiratory insufficiency. Moderate right pleural effusion is smaller. Extent of right basal atelectasis is hard to assess. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has improved. Pulmonary edema minimal if any. ET tube in standard placement. Swan-Ganz catheter partially obscured by overlying EKG leads probably ends in the right descending pulmonary artery, several cm beyond optimal placement.
