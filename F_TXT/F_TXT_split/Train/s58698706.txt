Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 8.2 cm from the carina, at the level of the thoracic inlet. An enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach, and off the inferior borders of the film. Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right atrium. Heart size appears borderline enlarged. The aorta is unfolded. Mild pulmonary edema is noted. The lung volumes are low with patchy atelectasis demonstrated in the lung bases. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified, however the extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
