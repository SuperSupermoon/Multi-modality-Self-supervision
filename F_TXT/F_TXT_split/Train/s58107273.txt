There is a large right-sided pneumothorax which has developed since the previous study. Endotracheal tube tip has been pulled back and is now 6 cm above the carina. The left side central venous line and nasogastric tube are appropriately positioned. Heart size is within normal limits. There are patchy diffuse airspace opacities throughout both lungs which appear stable.
