In comparison with study of ___, there has been a thoracentesis on the left with removal of a substantial amount of pleural fluid. No definite evidence of pneumothorax. However, on the right, there is increased haziness of the right hemithorax with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with increasing accumulation of pleural fluid on this side. Part of this could merely reflect change in patient's position.
