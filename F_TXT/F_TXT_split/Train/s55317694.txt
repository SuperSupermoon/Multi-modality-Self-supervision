Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates endotracheal tube in appropriate position 4 cm above the level of the carina, enteric feeding tube coursing midline with tip in stomach and side ports below the level of the diaphragm. Left subclavian CVL tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Hypo inflated lungs with a new linear platelike left lower lobe atelectasis. Interval improvement in appearance of right lower lobe with decreased rightwards mediastinal shift. Improved but persistent right lower lobe heterogeneous opacity is most likely a combination of hyper expansion pulmonary edema and residual atelectasis. No pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are otherwise unremarkable. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
