As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of pulmonary edema have decreased in extent and severity. However, signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema are still present. The extent of the bilateral pleural effusions is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly without parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia, but areas of bibasal atelectasis are still clearly visible.
