Again seen is a single-lead pacemaker that partially overlies the patient's known left upper lung mass. The heart is moderately enlarged and there are bilateral lower lobe infiltrates that have increased compared to the study from the prior day. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution and perihilar haze. The overlying impression is that of CHF, although an infectious infiltrate in the lower lungs cannot be excluded.
