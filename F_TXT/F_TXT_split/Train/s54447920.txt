The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The lung volumes are extremely low, with mild asymmetric elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Opacity in the right lung base, likely represents atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen. A small right pleural effusion is likely present. If there is concern for rib fracture, dedicated rib series can be performed with a marker placed at the site of maximum tenderness.
