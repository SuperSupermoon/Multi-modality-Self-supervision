There has been interval placement of a left thoracostomy tube, with slight decrease in size of a known left pneumothorax. Subcutaneous gas overlies the tube entry site. The right long remains clear. The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours within remain within normal limits. Multiple left-sided rib fractures are again demonstrated.
