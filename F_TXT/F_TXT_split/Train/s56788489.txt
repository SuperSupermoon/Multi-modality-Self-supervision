1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. 2. Low lung volumes with bibasilar airspace opacities and likely layering effusions suggestive of compressive atelectasis, less likely pneumonia. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Heart remains enlarged. Overall mediastinal contours are likely unchanged, given differences in positioning and technique between studies. Degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular joint. Cystic changes within an incompletely visualized right humeral head, possibly related to degenerative change or remote trauma.
