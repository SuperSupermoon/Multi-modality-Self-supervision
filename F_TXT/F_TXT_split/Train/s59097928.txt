Single portable view of the chest. Endotracheal tube is seen with tip approximately 3.3 cm from the carina, in appropriate position. An enteric tube is seen with tip in the region of the gastric fundus side port likely in the distal esophagus. Low inspiratory volume is seen. Increased opacity at the right lung apex suggestive of right upper lobe collapse. Elsewhere the lungs are grossly clear noting left basilar linear opacity suggestive of atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
