There are bilateral interstitial opacities with prominence, cephalization, and indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. Left hemidiaphragm appears blunted, likely due to a small pleural effusion. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic arch. More confluent right basilar opacities may represent an overlying early infectious process. Ossific density is noted at the level of the inferior posterior labrum and nonspecific but may represent a reverse Bankhart fragment from prior injury. No acute fractures are identified.
