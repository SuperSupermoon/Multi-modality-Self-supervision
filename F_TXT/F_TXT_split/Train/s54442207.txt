Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. An overlying the external pacer wire is seen. A nodular density in the right lower lung likely represents a nipple shadow. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. Bony structures appear intact. No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
