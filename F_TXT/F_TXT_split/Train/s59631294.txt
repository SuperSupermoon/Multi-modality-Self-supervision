CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the film overlying the gastric fundus. If a side port is present, it is not well visualized but could lie in the region of the GE junction. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is cardiomegaly, with prominence of the mediastinum including the right paratracheal tissues and the silhouette of the main pulmonary artery. Also again seen is CHF, with interstitial edema and some patchy opacity at both lung bases including suggestion of air bronchograms in the retrocardiac region. A small left effusion cannot be entirely excluded, but no gross effusion is seen on either side.
