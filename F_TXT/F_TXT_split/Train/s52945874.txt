In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change in the small left apical pneumothorax and extensive subcutaneous gas along the left lateral chest wall. Pigtail pleural drainage catheter remains in place. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is again seen. Small left pleural effusion persists.
