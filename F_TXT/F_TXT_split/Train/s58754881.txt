Lower lung volumes are noted. Blunting of the left lateral costophrenic angle is likely due to combination of rotation with prominent mediastinal fat as seen on CT scan. Superiorly, the lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No displaced fractures identified.
