Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC. The heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There has been interval improvement in aeration of the left lung base. A small left pleural effusion is likely present. Persistent partially loculated small to moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged with adjacent right basilar opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is identified.
