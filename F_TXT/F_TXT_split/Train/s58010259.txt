Semi-erect portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with bilateral parenchymal opacities again seen, consistent with multifocal pneumonia, as well as bibasilar atelectasis. A right PICC appears retracted slightly since the prior study from ___, and now resides in the low SVC, still in appropriate position. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Spinal fusion rods are also unchanged.
