The endotracheal tube ends 4.8 cm above the level of the carina. The left PICC ends in the low SVC, as before. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has minimally improved. Dense left retrocardiac opacification is not significantly changed, likely atelectasis. A small left pleural effusion is not significantly changed. A small layering right pleural effusion is also not significantly changed. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax. A displaced fracture of the proximal right humerus is again noted.
