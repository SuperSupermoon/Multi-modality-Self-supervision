There is an ET tube 5.1 cm from the carina. An OG tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm into the stomach. Since the most recent prior radiograph, there has been interval worsening of bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities, most pronounced in the right upper and lower lung zones. Again seen is a small right pleural effusion. There is no definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with atortuous aorta. Median sternotomy wires are present.
