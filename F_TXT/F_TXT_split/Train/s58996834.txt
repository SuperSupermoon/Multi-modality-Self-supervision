CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Compared with prior study, radiopaque portion of the Dobbhoff tube lies very slightly lower, but has not crossed the GE junction. The transverse area of lucency within the radio-opaque tip of the tube seen on the most recent prior CXR is not clearly seen on the current examination. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
