As compared to the previous radiograph, the chest tube is now on water-seal. Left pneumothorax has moderately increased in extent. As a consequence, the density of the left lung parenchyma has also increased. On the right, the pre-existing densities, predominating at the right lung base, have increased in extent and severity. The nasogastric tube and the right internal jugular vein catheter are constant.
