AP chest compared to ___: Reticular interstitial abnormality in the lower lungs has improved slightly on the left since ___, but has been present to a substantial degree since ___. This could be edema, but I suspect it is largely a chronic infiltrative pulmonary disease, including possible pulmonary fibrosis. Lung volumes have improved following tracheal extubation. Heart size is top normal. Pleural effusions are minimal if any. No pneumothorax. Left jugular line ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.
