Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is a central venous line from IJ approach with the distal tip in the distal SVC. There is a PICC line whose distal tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Heart size is somewhat globular. This is stable. There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity and left-sided pleural effusion. The right base appears better aerated and there has been reduction in the pleural fluid since the prior study. There are no pneumothoraces. Contrast material is seen within the colon at the splenic flexure.
