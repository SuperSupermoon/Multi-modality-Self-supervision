AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Widespread severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality had worsened substantially between ___ and ___, subsequently improved on ___ and has not changed since. Severe cardiomegaly is also unchanged. This suggests that all recoverable pulmonary edema has cleared and noncardiogenic edema due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage remains. The very large cardiac silhouette suggests cardiomyopathy and tendency to cardiogenic edema. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. Dual-channel left internal jugular line ends in the upper SVC and a feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
