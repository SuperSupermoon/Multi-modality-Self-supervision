Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There are low lung volumes, increasing opacities in the lower lobes are partially due to increasing atelectasis. There is continuous improvement of left upper lobe opacities, now almost completely resolved. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
