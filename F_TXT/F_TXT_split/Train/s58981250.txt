There are no significant changes compared to the prior radiograph performed yesterday morning. On the right side, there is a mild to moderate pleural effusion as well as underlying area of consolidation. Left lung base opacity may be due to atelectasis and/or consolidation. No pneumothorax. Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette. Splenic calcifications due to auto-infarction are less well visualized on this radiograph; this can be partially seen on CT chest from ___. Osseous structures are dense diffusely, and there is a probable right humeral infarct, findings consistent with sickle cell disease. The IJ introducer terminates at the distal SVC. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. The enteric tube extends to the stomach.
