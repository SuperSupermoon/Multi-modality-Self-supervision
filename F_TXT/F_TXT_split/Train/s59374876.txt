As compared to the previous radiograph, patient has received an endotracheal tube. The tip of the tube projects 1 cm above the carina and should be pulled back by approximately 2 to 3 cm. The patient has also received a nasogastric tube, the tube is in correct position. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The right internal jugular venous introduction sheath is unchanged. The lung volumes have slightly improved, potentially as a reflection of the increased ventilatory pressure. However, the moderate cardiomegaly and signs of relatively extensive left lower lobe atelectasis persist.
