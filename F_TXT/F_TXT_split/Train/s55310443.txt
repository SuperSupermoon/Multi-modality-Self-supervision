There is a very large left-sided pleural effusion with complete collapse of the left lower lobe and the lingula. This has increased significantly in size when compared to the prior abdominal radiograph. The right lung appears grossly clear. No right-sided pleural effusion seen. A dense nodular opacity at the left apex is likely due to multiple overlapping bony structures.
