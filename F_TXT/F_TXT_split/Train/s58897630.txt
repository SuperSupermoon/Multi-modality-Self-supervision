Heterogeneous opacification has progressed in both lower lung zones, particular the left.

Heart size is obscured by the elevated diaphragm, but azygos vein is mildly distended suggesting elevated central venous pressure or volume. ET tube and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements.
