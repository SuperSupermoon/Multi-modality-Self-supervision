Patient has received an endotracheal tube. The tip projects over the mid trachea, 0.2 cm above the carina. The other monitoring and support devices are constant. The endotracheal tube, however, was already seen at the previous exam. Unchanged evidence of bilateral pleural effusions with subsequent areas of atelectasis and moderate cardiomegaly. No changes in the well-ventilated lung areas.
