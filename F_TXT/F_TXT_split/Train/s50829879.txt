In comparison with the study of ___, the apparent right IJ catheter again appears malpositioned, though the tip now all points slightly upward as well as to the right. The tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 4.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the upper stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the image. Again the left hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen, suggesting small pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
