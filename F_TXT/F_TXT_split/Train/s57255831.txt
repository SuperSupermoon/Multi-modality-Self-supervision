Endotracheal tube is in position in the mid trachea. Enteric tube traverses to the stomach. There are bilateral perihilar opacities, left greater than right, suggestive of mild to moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema. A few opacities are noted on the left and likely atelectatic/contusions. Additionally, there may be a very small left pneumothorax. There is irregularity of the left lateral fifth rib and the right lateral second rib, partially evaluated, which may represent rib fractures. No right-sided pneumothorax. Right subcutaneous tissue air is noted.
