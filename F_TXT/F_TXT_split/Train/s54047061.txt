As compared to the previous radiograph. The position of the endotracheal tube is unchanged. The feeding tube appears to be partly coiled in the pharynx an should be repositioned. The radiolucency of the lung bases has increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The bilateral parenchymal opacities are still clearly visible but have decreased in extent and severity. Moderate cardiomegaly. Decrease in extent of a pre-existing right pleural effusion.
