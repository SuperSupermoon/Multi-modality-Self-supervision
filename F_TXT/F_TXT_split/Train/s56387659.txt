Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.9 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, distal aspect not included on the images. There are low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities are seen, which could be due to aspiration or infection. There is also mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. No pneumothorax is seen. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle which is most likely due to overlying soft tissue, though a trace pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
