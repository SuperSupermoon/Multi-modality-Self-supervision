Lung volumes are low. Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip appears to terminate within the proximal right atrium. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Patchy opacity within the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis. No focal consolidation, definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Posterior fusion hardware is again noted within the upper thoracic spine.
