As compared to the previous radiograph, the left chest tube has been pulled back. The newly inserted right chest tube is in correct position. There is no evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. The size of the cardiac silhouette is still at the upper range of normal. Well the left lung has increased in transparency, likely reflecting improved ventilation, the right lung is slightly denser than on the previous image.
