Again, endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, the inferior aspect not included on the image. Inferior vena cava stent is stable in position and appearance. Left pigtail chest tube is again seen. There are small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. Additional right base opacity is seen, which in part be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis; however, consolidation is also likely present. Minimal increase in the perihilar opacities consistent with mild edema. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
