Since prior, there is no significant interval change. An endotracheal tube, left subclavian central line, and left chest tube are unchanged in position. A line in the lateral left soft tissues that courses superiorly, likely overlies the patient. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The right and left lung are grossly clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Multiple left rib fractures are again seen.
