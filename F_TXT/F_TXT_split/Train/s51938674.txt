There is little change compared to prior examination with redemonstration of significant cardiomegaly and postoperative mediastinal contour. A central vascular congestion with upper zone redistribution is again noted without frank interstitial edema. There is redemonstration of a retrocardiac consolidation which obscures the left hemidiaphragm. A right-sided PICC terminates in the low SVC. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
