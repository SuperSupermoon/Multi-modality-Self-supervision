AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made to the next preceding similar study of ___. High positioned diaphragms indicate poor inspirational effort and result in crowded appearance of basal pulmonary vasculature bilaterally. There is no evidence of new acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates and the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. Heart size cannot be assessed as major portions of the heart are obliterated by high positioned diaphragms. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area and the previously described right-sided PICC line terminates in unchanged position.
