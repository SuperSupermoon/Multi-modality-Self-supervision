In comparison with the study of ___, the tracheostomy remains in place. Continued opacification at the lower portion of the right hemithorax, most likely representing lower lobe collapse though superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. Retrocardiac opacification with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm again suggests volume loss in the left lower lobe, though residual consolidation can certainly not be excluded on this single frontal view. Otherwise, little change.
