ET tube in standard placement. No nasogastric tube is visible in the field of view. Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC. Lung volumes remain quite low, explained by visible atelectasis in the left lower lobe accompanied by small stable left pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette is obscured by the left diaphragm contour, probably not appreciably enlarged.
