AP chest compared to ___, 4:50 and 5:10 p.m.: Previous right middle lobe collapse has improved minimally. There is probably also a substantial residue of atelectasis in the lower lobe. Moderate cardiomegaly, mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement are unchanged. Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian vascular line, and transvenous atrio-biventricular pacer defibrillator leads are all in standard placements. No pneumothorax. Some right pleural effusion is presumed but cannot be quantified.
