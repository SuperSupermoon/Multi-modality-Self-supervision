As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with mild elongation of the descending aorta. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema. A small linear scar in the right upper lobe, projecting over the posterior aspect of the sixth right rib, should receive attention on further followup. New abdominal drain is visualized.
