Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube terminating 4.2 cm above the carina. There is now striking near confluent bilateral pulmonary white-out with minimal apical sparing, rapidly worsened since 4 hours ago. There are dense opacities in the lung bases obscuring the diaphragmatic contours and costophrenic angles. Assessment for pleural effusion is limited. There is no pneumothorax. Below the diaphragm, a TIPS is in place. Air distended bowel loops are incompletely imaged.
