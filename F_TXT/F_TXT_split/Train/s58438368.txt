The patient's chin overlies the medial lung apices. The patient appears to be kyphotic in position. Mediastinum appears somewhat prominent, although there is suggestion that the patient may have a dilated esophagus and the mediastinum is not well evaluated. If patient able, suggest dedicated PA and lateral views for further and better evaluation and/or comparison with prior studies. There is left ___ and ___ opacity which could be due to atelectasis, aspiration and/or infection. No large pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. What appear to be chain sutures are noted in the left upper to mid abdomen. There is gaseous distention of bowel partially imaged in the left upper quadrant/abdomen, not well assessed.
