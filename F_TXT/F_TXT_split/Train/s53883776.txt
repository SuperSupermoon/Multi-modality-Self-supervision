Low lung volumes are present. Heart size is accentuated as a result, appearing borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities in lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace right pleural effusion. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated. Pneumobilia is seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
