Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Diffuse lung opacities in the right lung have minimally improved in the perihilar region. Left lower lobe opacities have improved. Bilateral effusions, larger on the right side are probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. There is no pneumothorax. Mild vascular congestion is stable. There is no overt pulmonary edema. Right supraclavicular catheter tip is in the cavoatrial junction. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Loss of volume in the right middle lobe and right lower lobes is unchanged.
