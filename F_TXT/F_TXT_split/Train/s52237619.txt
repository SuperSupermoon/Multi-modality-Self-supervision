Cardiomegaly is accompanied by a tortuous thoracic aorta and pulmonary vascular congestion. Permanent pacemaker is present with leads overlying expected locations of right atrium and right ventricle. Combined alveolar and interstitial opacities may reflect acute pulmonary edema, but followup radiographs after diuresis are strongly suggested to exclude a more chronic interstitial process. At that time, a more confluent area opacity in the left retrocardiac region may also be better evaluated.
