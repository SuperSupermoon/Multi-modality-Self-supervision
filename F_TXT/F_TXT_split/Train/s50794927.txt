Endotracheal tube has been re-positioned, with tip now terminating 4.2 cm above the carina. However, the tip appears to abut the lateral left wall of the trachea. This could be projectional as the patient is rotated, but attention to this area on a repeat, non-rotated radiograph may be helpful for confirmation. Nasogastric tube is coiled in the stomach with tip directed towards the GE junction. Heart size is normal, and lungs are clear.
