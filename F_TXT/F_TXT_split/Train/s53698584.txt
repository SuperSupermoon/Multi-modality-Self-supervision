The patient is rotated somewhat to the right. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. Left base patchy opacity is seen which could be due to pneumonia or aspiration versus atelectasis. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. There may be minimal central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. Dual lead left-sided pacer device is seen, new since the prior study, with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.
