Previously generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality has improved in the upper lungs, still present in the left perihilar and both basal regions. Particularly on the left there is coalescent consolidation in the lower lobe. Given the change over 24 hr, this could be due to improving edema or decreasing pulmonary infection. The heart is not large, mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature are not engorged and there is no appreciable pleural effusion, so interstitial pneumonia becomes more likely, including virus and PJP. Pneumoperitoneum is no larger today than it was yesterday, but the explanation is not apparent.
