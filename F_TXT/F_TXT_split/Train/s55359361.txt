The right IJ catheter is unchanged in position. There are increasing right mid and lower, and left upper parenchymal opacities, which may represent multifocal pneumonia, however the rapid increased in severity suggests ARDS, aspiration, or hemorrhage. The linear opacity within the left lower lung likely represents subsegmental atelectasis. There is a small right pleural effusion. Cardiac size is difficult to evaluate. There is no pneumothorax.
