Overall, appearances are very similar when compared to the prior study. Lung volumes remain low with a moderate left pleural effusion and left basal airspace opacity. This is likely due to atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded. The right lung appears grossly clear. A right chest wall pacemaker is unchanged in appearance. Leads from a previously removed pacemaker also seen. No pneumothorax seen. Mild prominence of the bilateral hila and pulmonary vasculature is similar in degree when compared to the prior study and consistent with a degree of congestive heart failure. Moderate cardiomegaly.
