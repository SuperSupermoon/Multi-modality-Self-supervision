Compared to the recent radiograph from 1 day earlier, a pericardial drain has been placed overlying the left heart border. A moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent left basilar opacification have slightly worsened. Moderate to large right pleural effusion persists with slight worsening of diffuse right lung consolidation, which is been more fully evaluated by a recent CTA of the chest from 1 day earlier.
