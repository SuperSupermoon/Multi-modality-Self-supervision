No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is evident on this view. The small lung laceration seen on CT is not evident radiographically. Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Mild thoracic scoliosis and loss of lower thoracic vertebral body height is consistent with known fracture, better seen on CT. Prior left clavicular fracture is noted.
