The axis of the heart is rotated to the midline, but the aorta appears to descend on the left side. There is no evidence of CHF or pneumothorax. The right base is obscured by the rotated cardiac silhouette and patient rotation to the right. There is patchy atelectasis in both lung bases and in the right perihilar region. A PA and lateral film in the department would be recommended when the patient is stable. . Correlation with prior cardiac imaging would be recommended if available. .
