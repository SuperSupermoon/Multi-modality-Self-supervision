The patient has had median sternotomy with valvuloplasty. Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, but the right IJ sheath remains in place. Bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal drains remain in place. The patient has been extubated, and a nasogastric tube has been removed. Lung volumes are low. Mild bilateral pulmonary edema has improved. There is new mild mediastinal widening which is likely due to vascular congestion, however attention on followup is advised. Left basilar atelectasis or infection is unchanged.
