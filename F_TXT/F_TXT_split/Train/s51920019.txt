Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position except for slight advancement of Swan-Ganz catheter into left main pulmonary artery. New homogeneous opacity abutting the left upper and mid mediastinal contours probably represents acute left upper lobe collapse, particularly considering volume loss in the left hemithorax. There is also substantial left lower lobe atelectasis. Moderate left pleural effusion has increased in size and appears partially loculated. Small right pleural effusion has apparently decreased in size with associated improving aeration of the adjacent right lower lobe. At the time of this dictation, a subsequent chest radiograph has been performed demonstrating resolution of the left upper lobe collapse. It is dictated separately under clip ___.
