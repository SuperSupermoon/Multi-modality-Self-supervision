Interval of the left chest tubes with no definite pneumothorax appreciated. Followup imaging would be advised. There continues to be a diffuse airspace process in the right lung and at the left base which does not appear to be significantly changed. Stable soft tissue opacity at the left apex consistent with focal pleural thickening or loculated fluid. Stable enlarged cardiac and mediastinal contours. The patient's mandible obscures the apices to some extent. Layering bilateral effusions also unchanged.
