The heart size is mildly enlarged and has a slightly globular configuration. It is not classic for pericardial effusion, but given history, an echocardiogram would be helpful. Lung volumes are low with slightly elevated right hemidiaphragm. Early infiltrate in the lower lobes cannot be excluded. There is mild pulmonary vascular re-distribution.
