There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema. Recurrent patchy opacification is seen within the right lower lobe, compatible with waxing and waning atelectasis. Stable moderate cardiomegaly is again noted. The mediastinal contours are normal. There has been interval removal of a right-sided subclavian central venous catheter. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing into the stomach and out of view of the radiograph.
