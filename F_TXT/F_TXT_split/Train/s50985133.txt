An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.3 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm, off film. A left subclavian central line tip overlies the mid SVC. Tubing overlying the left upper chest is noted -- this appears to represent a left-sided chest tube, similar to prior. Clinical correlation is requested. Two additional chest tubes are present on the right side. No obvious pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but stable, likely accentuated by technique. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a small left effusion. There is some patchy opacity at the right base. No gross right effusion. Compared with ___ and allowing for differences in technique, the overall appearance is similar. Possible slight increase in CHF findings.
