AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, ___: Heterogeneous opacification in the left mid and lower lung zones could be artifact of biopsy, including atelectasis and hemorrhage, could alternatively reflect aspiration. I would recommend a followup with conventional chest radiographs when feasible. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Right lung clear. Cardiomegaly mild to moderate, but no pulmonary edema or particular vascular engorgement is present.
