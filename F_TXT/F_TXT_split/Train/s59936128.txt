Again seen is a chest tube at the left lung base. Also again seen is extensive opacification of the left lung. Allowing for technical differences, the degree of residual aeration at the left lung is relatively similar. No pneumothorax is identified. As previously suggested, there is probable volume loss on the left, with persistent slight leftward shift of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The right lung shows upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora as well as right base atelectasis. Vascular plethora may be slightly greater. No right-sided effusion.
