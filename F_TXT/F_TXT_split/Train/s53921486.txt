Compared with ___ at 04:41 and allowing for technical differences, the overall appearance is quite similar. Again seen is a left-sided PICC line, tip over proximal/mid SVC. No pneumothorax detected. Again seen is a left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, as well as persistent retrocardiac opacity. Patchy opacities at the right base medially and laterally are also similar. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Vascular plethora and mild vascular blurring is similar to the prior study.
