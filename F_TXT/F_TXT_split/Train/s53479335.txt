AP portable semi upright view of the chest. There is irregular opacity at the left lung base which could represent atelectasis or aspiration, difficult to exclude contusion given history of fall. There is also mild platelike right basal atelectasis. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax on this semi upright portable radiograph. Heart size cannot be assessed. Mediastinal contour appears well-defined. Reported rib fractures are poorly visualized.
