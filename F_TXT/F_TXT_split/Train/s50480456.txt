Right internal jugular and subclavian central lines are unchanged in position. Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet. There is a nasogastric tube visualized down to the level of the mid esophagus but due to technique it cannot be seen distally. The patient is markedly rotated limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours in this patient status post median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement. There is improved aeration in the right lung but worsening aeration of the left lung suggesting asymmetric fluctuating pulmonary edema. It is difficult to exclude a superimposed infectious process. There may be small layering effusions. No pneumothorax.
