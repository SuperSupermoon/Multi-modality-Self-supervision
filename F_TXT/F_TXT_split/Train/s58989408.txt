As compared to the previous radiograph from earlier today, bilateral pleural effusions have apparently increased in size, particularly on the right. Both effusions appear to be partially layering on this semi upright radiograph. Previously noted small right apical pneumothorax is no longer visualized, but positional differences may limit the detection of small pneumothoraces.
