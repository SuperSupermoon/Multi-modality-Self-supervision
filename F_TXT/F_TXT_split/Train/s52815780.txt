In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with a triple lead pacer in place with leads extending to the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus distribution. Prominent dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is again seen as well as multiple old healed rib fractures on the right with probable calcified pleural plaques. Specifically, no evidence of pulmonary edema or acute focal pneumonia.
