No previous images. There are multiple left rib fractures as well as a fracture of the clavicle and possibly the base of the acromion. However, no evidence of acute rib fracture. Opacification at the left base could reflect atelectasis or possible fluid in the pleural space. There is a curvilinear opacification in the region of the left hemidiaphragm, which could represent pleural calcifications.
