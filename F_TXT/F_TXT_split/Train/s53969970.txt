AP chest compared to ___: Small discrete areas of increased opacification in the lungs, right infrahilar and left base laterally are not necessarily significant, but are better evaluated with conventional chest radiographs to exclude pneumonia. As before, the heart is severely enlarged, but today pulmonary vasculature is more engorged, although there is no edema or pleural effusion.
