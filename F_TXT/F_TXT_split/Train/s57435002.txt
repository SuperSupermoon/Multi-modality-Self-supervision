Following removal of right pigtail pleural catheter, there is a probable tiny right apical pneumothorax present, and a moderate layering right pleural effusion has increased in size. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged (due to cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion) and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate pulmonary edema. The latter appeared asymmetrical, involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has increased in size with adjacent atelectasis in the left retrocardiac area.
