1. Interval extubation. Patchy opacities at both bases may reflect bibasilar atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Clinical correlation is advised. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient rotation between studies. Right seventh posterolateral rib fracture is again identified, likely subacute as there does appear to be some evidence of callus formation. Other more inferior right-sided rib fractures are not as well visualized on today's study. No pneumothorax.
