Markedly rotated positioning. An ET tube is present. Allowing for rotation, the tip lies approximately 4.9 cm above the carina, at the level of the clavicles. An NG tube is present. The tip is only seen at the level of the mid mediastinum. The sideport lies at the level of the clavicular heads. Rotation limits assessment of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and lung fields, but again seen is evidence for marked cardiomegaly as well as opacities in both lungs. At the time of this dictation, a subsequent chest x-ray from ___, 10:12 a.m., is available. Please see report from that study, which also shows similar position of the ET tube and NG tube.
