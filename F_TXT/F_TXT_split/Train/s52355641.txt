As compared to ___, lung volumes are improved. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable, with persistent postoperative alterations in the right hemi thorax related to recent right upper lobe resection. Right chest tube remains in place, with persistent small amount of pleural fluid at the right apex, but there is no evidence of apical pneumothorax. Unusually sharp appearance of right hemidiaphragm could potentially represent a basilar pneumothorax, attention to this region on short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
