On the current image, a 1 cm apicolateral pneumothorax on the left is seen. In retrospect, this pneumothorax could already have been present today at 4:12 a.m., but was smaller than before. The chest x-ray shows no evidence of tension. The intrafissural pigtail catheter position documented on the CT examination from ___, 11:19 a.m., is not apparent on the chest radiograph. The changes in the left upper lung and the right lung are constant in appearance.
