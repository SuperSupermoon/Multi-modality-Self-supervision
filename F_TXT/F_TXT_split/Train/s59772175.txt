Comparison is made to the prior study from ___. There is a moderate right apical pneumothorax. This is increased in size since the previous study. No pneumothorax on the left side is seen. There is an endotracheal tube, right IJ central line and right-sided feeding tube whose side port is again at the GE junction. There are again seen diffuse air space opacities and consolidations throughout both lung fields which appear stable. There is likely a left-sided pleural effusion.
