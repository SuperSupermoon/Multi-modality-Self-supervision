Rotated positioning. An ET tube is present, tip 3.4 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Again seen is focally dense, somewhat patchy, opacity in the right lung base medially, essentially unchanged. Mild patchy opacity at the left lung base is also similar to the prior film. No CHF or gross effusion. Relative lucency interposed between the right base opacity and right hemidiaphragm is again noted. Doubt pneumothorax.
