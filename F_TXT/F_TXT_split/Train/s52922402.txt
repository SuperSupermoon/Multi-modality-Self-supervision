In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of a right IJ pacer that extends to the region of the apex of the right ventricle. No evidence of pneumothorax. Opacification at the right base could represent atelectasis and small effusion. Somewhat similar but less prominent appearance is seen on the left. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
