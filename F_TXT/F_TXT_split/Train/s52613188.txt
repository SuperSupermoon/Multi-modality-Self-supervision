Cardiac silhouette size is borderline enlarged but unchanged. Aortic knob calcifications are again noted. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes re- demonstrated, most pronounced in the upper lobes. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus on the frontal view is unchanged, and could relate to pleural thickening. Linear scarring within the left upper lobe is unchanged. Mild interstitial prominence at the lung bases is improved compared to the previous exam and may reflect chronic changes. Remote right-sided rib fractures are noted. No subdiaphragmatic free air.
