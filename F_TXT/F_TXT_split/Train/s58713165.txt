In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial clearing of the bilateral pulmonary opacifications. There is still some indistinctness of engorged vessels, consistent with some residual elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Left hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, though there still may well be some small pleural effusion and atelectasis at the left base.
