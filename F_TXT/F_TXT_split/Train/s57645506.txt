The heart is enlarged but likely exaggerated related to lower lung volumes. Pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured secondary to a small left pleural effusion and increasing adjacent atelectasis though given patient's current symptoms a superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax are seen.
