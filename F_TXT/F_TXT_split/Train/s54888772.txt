As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in severity and extent of the pre-existing already extensive left pleural effusion. The small right pleural effusion is constant. The lung volumes have decreased, which causes an increase in density of all pre-existing parenchymal opacities. The overall extent and severity of these opacities, however, is unlikely to have substantially changed. No new parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax. The alignment of the sternal wires is constant.
