AP chest radiograph is taken with the patient in the upright position. Heart size cannot be accurately assessed from the AP technique. Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable except for prominence of right paramedian stripe, possibly representing an azygos fissure. Small area of opacity projecting over the left base is compatible with atelectasis or consolidation. The lungs are otherwise clear. Small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
