AP chest compared to ___:54 a.m. today: Large right pneumothorax has increased, with more leftward mediastinal shift and more depression of the right hemidiaphragm, suggesting hemodynamical tension. Consolidation in the right lower lobe, which appeared between ___, 4:28 p.m., following insertion of a right pleural tube and earlier this morning, has not improved. This could be due to increased suction, for example, if the right pleural tube is fissural, an explanation for failure to evacuate the pneumothorax as well. The large postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Left pleural drain is in unchanged in position. There is probably a tiny left apical pneumothorax, unchanged since at least ___. Upper lungs are clear. Endotracheal tube is placed at the appropriate level in the trachea, although the tip abuts the left wall due to marked displacement by the enlarged aorta. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced at least 8 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction. Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr ___ at 8:45 a.m., responding to my page to ___ at 7:45 a.m.
