Partial collapse of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe with air bronchograms may represent mild re-expansion alveolar edema versus right basilar pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion may have slightly improved. Opacification of the left lung has increased consistent with worsening left pleural effusion. The status of the underlying left lower lung is difficult to assess in the setting of an obscured cardiomediastinal silhouette as mediastinal shift is also difficult to assess. Left sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC. The tip of the enteric tube is not clearly identified. Spinal fusion hardware and median sternotomy wires are again noted.
