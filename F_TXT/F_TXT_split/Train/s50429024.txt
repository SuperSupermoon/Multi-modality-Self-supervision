As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities bilaterally have not substantially changed. The monitoring and support devices are constant. The size of the cardiac silhouette is also unchanged. Unchanged relative hyperinflation of the left upper lobe, but no convincing evidence of a left pneumothorax. No larger pleural effusions.
