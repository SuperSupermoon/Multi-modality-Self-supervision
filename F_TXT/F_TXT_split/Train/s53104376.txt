Heart is mildly enlarged. Symmetrical widening of superior mediastinal contours may be due to accentuation of tortuous vessels by apical lordotic projection and leftward patient rotation, but standard PA and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful to more fully evaluate the upper mediastinum when the patient's condition allows. If this is not feasible, CT could be performed. Lungs and pleural surfaces are clear.
