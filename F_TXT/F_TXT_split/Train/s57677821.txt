Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.8 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There are low lung volumes which cause crowding of bronchovascular structures. No pulmonary edema, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. Mild atelectasis is seen in the lung bases. There are no acutely displaced fractures.
