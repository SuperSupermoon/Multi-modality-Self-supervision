In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial improvement in the left pleural effusion. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with indistinct pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Some retrocardiac atelectatic change is again seen. In the appropriate clinical setting, lower lung consolidation cannot be excluded in the absence of a lateral view.
