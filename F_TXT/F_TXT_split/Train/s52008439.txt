In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside hospital, there again is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with fullness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, though less than on the previous study. There is opacification involving the lower half of the right hemithorax with obscuration of the heart border and hemidiaphragm. The appearance is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, along with pleural effusion and some volume loss at the right base. The left lung shows no evidence of acute pneumonia, though there are atelectatic changes obscuring the medial half of the left hemidiaphragm. . Hyperexpansion of the lungs suggests some underlying chronic pulmonary disease.
