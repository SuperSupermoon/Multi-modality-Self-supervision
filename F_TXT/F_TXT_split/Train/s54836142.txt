No previous images. There are low lung volumes which may accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. There is evidence of engorged and ill-defined vessels, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Some atelectatic changes are seen at the bases. The images are somewhat degraded due to scattered radiation related to the size of the patient.
