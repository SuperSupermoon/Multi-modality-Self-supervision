Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC. Pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and right ventricle.

As compared to the prior study overall no substantial change is demonstrated but the focal nature of the consolidations rather than diffuse and uniform opacity are concerning for infectious process at least as part of the abnormalities and not only pulmonary edema.
