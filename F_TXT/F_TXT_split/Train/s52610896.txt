Moderate right pleural effusion decreased between ___ and ___ has been stable subsequently. It is largely dependent but, probably loculated to some extent. Severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette is stable. Pulmonary vascular engorgement has worsened, but there is no edema. Right lower lobe is partially obscured by the pleural effusion and no doubt new partly atelectatic. As such I cannot exclude pneumonia in that location, but elsewhere the lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax. The right pectoral generator issues two trans subclavian leads, one terminating in the right atrium and the other, without a tip electrode, at the level of the superior cavoatrial junction. A sub xiphoid lead is company by a second fragmented lead, both terminating at the margin of the right atrium. The third sub xiphoid lead terminates along the floor of the right heart, fourth, along the diaphragmatic surface to the left of the midline, and if fifth, left of the midline at the base of the heart. In all of these intact and fragment leads are unchanged in position since at least ___.
