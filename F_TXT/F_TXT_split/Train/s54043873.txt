A portable view of the chest was obtained. Dual-lead left-sided pacer device is again seen in stable position. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is a hazy opacity at the lung bases, which may in part, relate to overlying soft tissue, but underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Bilateral pleural plaques are again demonstrated.
