Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vascularity is normal. Linear opacities within the lung bases likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is noted. The right costophrenic angle is not completely included in the field of view, though there is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
