1. Evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult given marked patient rotation on the current study. Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube, and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position, although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not visible on the current study. There is likely a layering left effusion. Patchy opacity at the right lung base is again seen and likely reflects atelectasis. There continues to be some more focal opacity at the left apex which is improving in aeration since ___ at 20:23. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
