Comparison is made with prior study ___. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Bibasilar multifocal opacities have worsened with new areas of consolidation in the right upper lobe consistent with worsening pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. Left pleural effusion is small. Sternal wires are aligned. There is unchanged vascular congestion. Of note, a rounded opacity in the right lower lobe has a central radiolucency. It is questionable that this could be a cavitation in an infectious process. Close followup and attention in this area is recommended.
