Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position when allowances are made for leftward patient rotation. Similarly, cardiomediastinal contours are stable accounting for this factor. Worsening airspace opacities throughout the right lung, most severe in the right upper lobe. In conjunction with pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema in the left lung, this probably represents asymmetrical edema, especially given rapid fluctuations over serial radiographs. Aspiration and infectious pneumonia are additional considerations in the appropriate clinical setting. Exam is otherwise remarkable for left retrocardiac atelectasis and/or consolidation with adjacent small-to-moderate pleural effusion, and layering right pleural effusion.
