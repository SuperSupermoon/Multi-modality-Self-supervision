Judging from the left lung, mild pulmonary edema has worsened since ___. On the right, a large region of consolidation lateral and inferior to the right hilus could be pneumonia although fissural pleural fluid can mask or simulate that process. CT scanning would be definitive. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Pulmonary artery enlargement is unchanged. Tip of the ET tube is indistinct, but probably appropriately positioned. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. Nasogastric tube can be followed as far as the upper stomach, and passes out of view. No pneumothorax.
