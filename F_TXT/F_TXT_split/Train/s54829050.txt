Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Lines and tubes are in standard position. Cardiac size is top normal. Left perihilar consolidation and right lower perihilar consolidation are grossly unchanged. Opacities in the right upper lobe have improved. This is consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Superimposed pulmonary edema, now mild, has also improved. There is no pneumothorax or large effusion.
