Since the prior exam, there is slight increasing density at the right base, which could be due to a slight increase in the small right pleural effusion or increasing atelectasis. A small left pleural effusion is unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is stable. There is no new consolidation. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. A left PICC terminates at the atriocaval junction.
