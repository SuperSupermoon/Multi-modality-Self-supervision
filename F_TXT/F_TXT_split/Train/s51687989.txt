A frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of a right PICC and interval placement of a left PICC , with tip terminating in the mid to lower SVC. Again seen is a catheter in the right upper abdomen. Lung volumes are improved compared to prior exam. The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated compared to the left. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation and the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
