Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with persistent very small right apical pneumothorax. Diffuse heterogeneous lung opacities are again demonstrated, including widespread reticular and nodular opacities attributed to metastatic disease. More confluent opacities at the lung bases as well as a dominant mass in the left lower lobe appear slightly increased compared to the prior study. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
