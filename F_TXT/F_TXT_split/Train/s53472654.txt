Radiograph centered in the lower chest was obtained to assess a feeding tube, which terminates in the expected location of the proximal duodenum. Within the chest, there has been development of pulmonary vascular congestion but improvement of previously reported left basilar opacities. Linear right basilar opacities probably reflect atelectasis adjacent to a large pericardial fat pad.
