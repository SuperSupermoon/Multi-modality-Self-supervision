Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular central line, left subclavian central line, and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. Left subclavian venous stent remains in place. There has been interval placement of a right chest tube with appearance of subcutaneous emphysema within the right lateral chest wall soft tissues. No obvious pneumothorax is seen. Hardware is seen overlying the thoracic spine. No change in bilateral diffuse airspace process consistent with a diffuse infection or ARDS. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given differences in patient rotation. Cystic changes in the right humeral head likely are degenerative in etiology.
