1 portable view. Tiny apical fibrocalcific scarring pleural thickening and cephalad hilar retraction are again demonstrated. The lungs appear otherwise clear. The heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged. A double-lumen right internal jugular catheter has been inserted and terminates at the level of the right atrium. There is no other significant change. The bony thorax is grossly intact.
