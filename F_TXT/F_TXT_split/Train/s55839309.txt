There has been very little change in the mid multifocal infiltrative pulmonary abnormality always worsened in the left lung. Also unchanged is the severely distended stomach. Previous moderate cardiomegaly may have improved. Pleural effusion if any is minimal. Question was raised at Conference yesterday about possibility of a left pneumothorax at the apex. Today that possible in air collection is smaller, but there is a suggestion of either pneumomediastinum or medial pneumothorax. Chest CT scanning would be a the clarify these findings. The indwelling right jugular central venous infusion port ends in the right atrium, as before.
