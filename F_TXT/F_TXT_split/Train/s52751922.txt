A left-sided PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes are low. Streaky opacities in the lower lungs are better assessed on prior CT which may reflect the sequelae of chronic aspiration. Cardiac size is normal. Bilateral patchy opacities in the lower lungs are slightly increased from prior. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
