There is silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm, likely due to a layering pleural effusion the right basal consolidation cannot be excluded. The left lung appears grossly clear. An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip is approximately 7 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. No pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC.
