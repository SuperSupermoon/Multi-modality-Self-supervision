There are relatively low lung volumes. Lateral right base opacity projecting over the right costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissue although underlying consolidation or trace pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The left lung is clear. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
