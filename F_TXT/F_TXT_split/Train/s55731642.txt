Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study. A left-sided subclavian catheter terminates in the proximal SVC. A right internal jugular Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid SVC. The cardiomediastinal contour is normal. There has been progression of the bilateral basal airspace opacities. This may reflect pulmonary edema versus is infection. Given the normal heart size, the latter is considered more likely. No pleural effusion seen. An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip is 4.7 cm above the carina. No pneumothorax seen.
