An ET tube is present at the level of the mid clavicular heads, approximately 8.5 cm above the carina, similar to the prior film. Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is present, tip overlying proximal right pulmonary artery. Multiple cardiac support devices are similar in configuration. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but similar to prior. There is vascular plethora and hazy opacity consistent with CHF. Probable small right effusion. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged. Left costophrenic angle is obscured by the LV assist device --___ small left effusion cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is detected.
