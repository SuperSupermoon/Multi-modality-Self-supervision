1. Given patient rotation, overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged. Right internal jugular central line, left subclavian central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position. Left upper quadrant catheter is also again identified. There is persisting consolidation in the retrocardiac area likely reflecting lower lobe collapse, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. There is likely an associated pleural effusion. The right lung is grossly clear. Overall, there has been slightly improved aeration at the right lung base. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
