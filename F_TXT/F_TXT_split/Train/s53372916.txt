There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest drain, in expected position. A moderate-to-large left pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size. Persistent left basilar opacity is likely a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis. There is mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle, suggestive of a small right effusion as well. There is diffuse increased pulmonary vascular congestion as compared to prior examination. Relative increased density of the right upper lung may be due to poor inspiration, though attention on follow-up examination is recommended to exclude a developing infection. No pneumothorax is evident. Surgical clips project over the lateral right lung apex. There has been interval removal of a right central venous catheter. Median sternotomy wires appear intact.
