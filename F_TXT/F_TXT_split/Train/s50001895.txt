Widespread subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum are new compared to the prior radiograph. The presence of this extent of subcutaneous emphysema reduces the sensitivity for detecting pneumothorax. At the time of this dictation, the patient has undergone a chest CT, which more clearly delineates the abnormal gas collections. Please see separately dictated CT under clip ___. Right pigtail pleural catheter has changed in position compared to prior radiograph, and is more fully evaluated on the subsequent CT as well. Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has increased in size since the prior radiograph. Worsening opacity in the right mid and lower lung may reflect atelectasis or aspiration.
