This post procedural radiograph demonstrates no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Right suprahilar lung nodule has been more fully evaluated by prior CT and PET CT. Exam is otherwise remarkable for small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent bibasilar atelectasis. Surgical clips are present in the right mid lung consistent with previous wedge resection site.
