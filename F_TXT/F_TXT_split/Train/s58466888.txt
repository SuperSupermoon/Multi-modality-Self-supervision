In comparison with the study of ___, there is some increased patchy opacification at the left base. This suggests the possibility of aspiration or pneumonia superimposed upon atelectasis and pleural effusion. Indistinctness of the right hemidiaphragm could reflect small effusion and atelectasis as well. Patchy area in the right mid zone could also represent a focus of consolidation. Engorgement of the pulmonary vessels suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
