Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates a substantial left sided pleural effusion and smaller right sided pleural effusion, both with adjacent atelectasis. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. A right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction. Endotracheal tube ends 7.8 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube is coiled in the stomach; radiographically the discontinuity of this tube is likely secondary to patient motion.
