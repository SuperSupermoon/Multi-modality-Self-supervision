Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable. Moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged. Presumed small bilateral effusions are unchanged. Right lower lobe opacity could be atelectasis and/or pneumonia. There is mild stable pulmonary edema. Left lower lobe opacities are likely atelectases.
