The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are normal. The trachea is midline. The hila are unremarkable. The lungs are clear. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax. There is no right pleural effusion. Poor visualization of the lateral left CP angle may relate to overlying soft tissues, however, a small left pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. There is mild dextroscoliosis of the mid thoracic spine.
