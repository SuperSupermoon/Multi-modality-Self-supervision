A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right internal jugular approach catheter terminating in the mid SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal and the lungs well-aerated without pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Subtle opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle could represent an early pneumonia. The visualized abdomen is unremarkable.
