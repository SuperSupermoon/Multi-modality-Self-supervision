Lung volumes are low. There are abnormal prominent interstitial markings with a peripheral and basilar predominance, compatible with organizing pneumonia. There are new bibasilar opacities with discoid morphology in the left lower lobe, and rounded morphology in the right lower lobe that partially silhouettes the hemidiaphragm. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is top normal. There are no significant pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
