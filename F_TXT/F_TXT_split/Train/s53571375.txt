Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous exam. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Several clips are noted projecting over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, compatible with fiducial markers. Additionally within the left upper quadrant is a gastric lap band, in unchanged position.
