The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal range. Costophrenic sulci are partly excluded, but there is no evidence for pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. There is a patchy right mid lung opacity, not present before and suggesting a subtle focus of infection. Streaky left basilar opacity is also present in the retrocardiac region.
