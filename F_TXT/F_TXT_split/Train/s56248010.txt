In comparison to the most recent prior study a right internal jugular central venous line and tracheostomy tube remain in appropriate position. The trachea remains narrowed. There is similar appearance of the opacified left lung base silhouetting the left heart border and left hemidiaphragm compatible with chronic moderate left pleural effusion and associated left lower lobe collapse. Streaky opacities in the right lung base are compatible with atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated but remains moderately enlarged. The mediastinal contours redemonstrated prominence of the azygos vein and calcification at the aortic arch but otherwise appears within normal limits. No pneumothorax is present. There is increased mild pulmonary vascular congestion from ___.
