In comparison with the study of ___, the left IJ catheter now extends to the upper-to-mid portion of the SVC. Hazy opacification of the left hemithorax with obliteration of the hemidiaphragmatic contour is consistent with substantial layering pleural effusion. There is evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure associated with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The increased opacification in the right mid and upper zone is not definitely appreciated on this study, though different obliquity of the patient somewhat makes evaluation somewhat more difficult.
