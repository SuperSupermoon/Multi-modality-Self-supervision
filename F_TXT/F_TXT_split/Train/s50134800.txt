In comparison with the study ___ ___, there may be mild improvement in the consolidation in the right lower lung. The opacification in the retrocardiac region is unchanged with obliteration of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour. This pattern is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion, though some superimposed pneumonia in this region cannot be excluded. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The right IJ catheter tip extends to the cavoatrial junction or possibly the upper portion of the right atrium.
