As compared to ___ chest radiograph, comparison is somewhat limited by marked patient rotation. Large partially loculated left pleural effusion is potentially slightly increased in size from the prior study, but positional differences limit comparison. Heterogeneous opacities throughout the right lung have also worsened, and a small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Repeat, number tube radiograph is suggested when the patient's condition allows.
