As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are constant. At both lung bases, the pre-existing areas of probably atelectatic opacities have minimally increased in extent. Also, the pre-existing blunting of the costophrenic sinus on the left is now a little more evident, so that the presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No other parenchymal opacities. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
