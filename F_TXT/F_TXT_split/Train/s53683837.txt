Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is seen throughout the chest wall bilaterally and extending into the neck and abdominal wall bilaterally. Right-sided chest tube is noted with tip terminating near the right lung base. The heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous. Pneumomediastinum is noted. Hilar contours are unremarkable. No shift of mediastinal structures is noted. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Assessment of the lung parenchyma is limited due to the extensive subcutaneous emphysema. There is a suggestion of a right basilar patchy opacity peripherally, which is nonspecific. Small right apical pneumothorax is likely present. Assessment for left-sided pneumothorax is limited, though a small left apical pneumothorax may be present. Displaced right ___ posterior rib fracture is noted.
