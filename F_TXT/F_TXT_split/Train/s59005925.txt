There has been significant interval worsening of the left sided pleural effusion with associated left lower lobe collapse. A right lower lung opacity is a combination of a layering effusion and atelectasis. Vascular congestion and interstitial edema is also unchanged. Assessment of cardiac size is limited due to technique but there appears to be moderate cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax. Left-sided PICC line ends in the mid SVC. Severe degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are reidentified.
