The configuration of a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device, with leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, appears unchanged. The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. The right costophrenic angle appears blunted, which suggests a small pleural effusion, potentially with associated atelectasis. However, when compared to the scout view from the prior CT, which is the most recent prior study, there has been no definite change. Patchy retrocardiac opacity suggesting minor atelectasis also appears unchanged. Predominantly peripheral interstitial changes which are more striking in the lower than upper lungs show no clear change. Lung volumes are again low.
