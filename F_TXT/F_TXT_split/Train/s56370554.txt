Following placement of right pigtail pleural catheter, a loculated right pleural effusion has decreased in size. There is no visible pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and worsening interstitial edema. Bibasilar opacities probably reflect atelectasis, although aspiration is an additional consideration as well as developing infectious pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size.
