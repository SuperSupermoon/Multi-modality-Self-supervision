As compared to the previous radiograph, there is substantial improvement with near-complete resolution of the pre-existing right pleural effusion and the right subsequent atelectasis. On the left, the contour of the hemidiaphragm is also sharper than before and suggests a decrease of the pre-existing small pleural effusion. No new parenchymal opacities. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
