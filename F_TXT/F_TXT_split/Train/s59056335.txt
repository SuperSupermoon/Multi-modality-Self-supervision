Diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities, overall similar to prior, with unchanged volume loss in the right upper zone. While, given the history, this presumably reflects pulmonary edema, the lack of effusion raises the possibility of other causes of alveolar opacity, including infection/ARDS and, in the appropriate clinical setting, hemorrhage. Clinical correlation requested.
