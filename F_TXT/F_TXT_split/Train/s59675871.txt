The left-sided PICC line terminates in the proximal superior vena cava. The tip of the enteric tube is difficult to visualize on this exam. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged with stable pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral minimal pulmonary edema. Again rightward deviation of the trachea is seen secondary to known enlargement of the left lobe of the thyroid. No new focal consolidation, significant pleural effusions or pneumothorax is identified.
