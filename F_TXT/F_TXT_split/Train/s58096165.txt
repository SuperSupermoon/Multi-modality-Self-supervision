As compared to ___ radiograph, lung volumes are low or, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures. Within this context, worsening bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis, but aspiration is an additional consideration. No free intraperitoneal air is identified, but it is uncertain whether the radiograph was obtained at a cyst fully upright position. If clinical suspicion persists, supplemental left lateral decubitus radiograph of the abdomen would be recommended.
