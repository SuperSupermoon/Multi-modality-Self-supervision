Again seen is significant retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms. Compared to ___, the there has been partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm suggesting slight interval progression of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation The right lung base is grossly clear. No gross right effusion. Small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with a left ventricular configuration. A right-sided pacemaker type device, with 3 leads, his unchanged. Note is made of several swirling of wires near their origin from the battery pack. There maybe there is equivocal slight upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. The Dobbhoff tube is present, tip overlying the gastric body. Incidental made note is made of finding is consistent with a right shoulder chronic rotator cuff tear. Mild deformity of a left upper chest rib is compatible with an old fracture, also seen in ___.
