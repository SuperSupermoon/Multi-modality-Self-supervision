The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 5.5 cm above the level of the carina. A right subclavian central venous catheter ends in the low SVC, as before. A left-sided pacemaker/ICD is noted, with associated right atrial, right ventricular, and coronary sinus leads. There has been interval removal of a right pleural catheter. A moderate right apical pneumothorax is not significantly changed in size. Moderate right lower lung atelectasis is decreased. The left lung is clear. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal. An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly. There has been an interval increase in the degree of right lateral chest wall air with a slight decrease in left lateral chest wall subcutaneous air.
