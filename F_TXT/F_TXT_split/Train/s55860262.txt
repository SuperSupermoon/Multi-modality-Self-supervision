There is a focal area of hazy opacity in the left lower lobe with loss of the left cardiac margin. This finding appears unchanged when compared to prior radiographs on NCT. There is prominent bronchopulmonary vascular markings with possible interstitial edema in the peripheral interlobular septa. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The imaged osseous structures are intact. There is no free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
