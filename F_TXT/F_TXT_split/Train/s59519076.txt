As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in appearance of the endotracheal tube, the right internal jugular vein catheter, the right-sided drains and the right medial small pneumothorax. The left pneumothorax, manifesting as a bandlike hyperlucency paralleling the vertebral bodies on the left is no longer visualized. The nasogastric tube shows an overall normal course but its gastric part is coiled and the tip of the tube points towards the gastric fundus. The tip is currently located approximately 2 cm below the left hemidiaphragm.
