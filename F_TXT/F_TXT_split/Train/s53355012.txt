The aortic contour and calcification pattern appears similar compared to prior studies. Descending thoracic aortic contour also appears similar to prior studies, but is obscured inferiorly by adjacent lung and pleural abnormalities. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and is accompanied by upper zone vascular redistribution. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are present as well as adjacent basilar atelectasis and/or consolidation, worse on the right than the left. ICD pacing device remains in place with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
