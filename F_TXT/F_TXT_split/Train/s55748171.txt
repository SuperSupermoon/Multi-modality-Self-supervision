The left hemithorax is now completely opacified, consistent with complete collapse of the left lung, probably due to mucus plugging. There is a known coexisting moderate left pleural effusion, difficult to quantify in the setting of complete left lung collapse. The lung is over expanded, and demonstrates mild pulmonary edema as well as linear bands of atelectasis. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
