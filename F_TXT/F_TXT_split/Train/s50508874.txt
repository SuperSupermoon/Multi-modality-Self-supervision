The lung volumes are low. There is increased density at both lung apices, suggesting a preexisting fibrotic or chronic inflammatory disease. The radiodensity of the lung parenchyma is slightly elevated, likely caused by soft tissue overlay and the low lung volumes. No evidence of acute changes. No clear visualization of nodules, although the interpretability of the image in this regard is low. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No larger pleural effusions. If a reliable radiologic baseline examination is desired, a CT should be performed.
