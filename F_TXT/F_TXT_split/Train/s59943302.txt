Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for low lung volumes. Worsening left retrocardiac opacities likely due to atelectasis in the setting of adjacent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, but coexisting aspiration or pneumonia are possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Small left pleural effusion is again demonstrated. Right lung is clear except for a patchy opacity at the right lung base, which could reflect patchy atelectasis, aspiration, or early pneumonia. Followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
