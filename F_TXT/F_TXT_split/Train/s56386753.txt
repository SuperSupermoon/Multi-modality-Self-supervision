In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric tube is been removed. The Dobhoff tube just straddles the esophagogastric junction and should be pushed forward about 8-10 cm for more optimal positioning. There is increasing opacification at the right base. This is consistent with worsening pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Less prominent basilar opacification is noted on the left. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and there may be some mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. A more coalescent area of opacification is again seen in the right mid zone. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could reflect superimposed pneumonia.
