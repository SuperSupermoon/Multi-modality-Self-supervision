The patient is markedly rotated, limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. However, the heart still remains enlarged. There has been interval appearance of mild pulmonary edema. There are likely layering effusions with patchy bibasilar opacities, left greater than the right, likely reflecting compressive lower lobe atelectasis. Pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. Right subclavian central line is unchanged in position with the tip in the distal SVC.
