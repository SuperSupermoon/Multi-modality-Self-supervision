Lung volumes have decreased but allowing for that, there has not necessarily been any real change in persistent opacification of the left mid to lower lung suggesting pneumonia. A coinciding pleural effusion is possible but not well demonstrated. There is vague but focal new right mid lung opacification. There is no pleural effusion on the right. Background bullous changes are suggested at the lung apices.
