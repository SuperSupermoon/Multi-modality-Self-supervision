Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier. Chest tube has been withdrawn few centimeters, still projects medially in the left upper hemithorax. Left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged. Increasing opacity in the left mid and lower hemithorax are likely increasing atelectases and probably increased small effusion. There are no other interval changes.
