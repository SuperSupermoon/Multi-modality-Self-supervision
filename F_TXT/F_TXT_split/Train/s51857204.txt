Rotated positioning. NG tube present, tip overlying gastric fundus. The gastric fundus itself is distended and there is elevation the left hemidiaphragm. A right PICC line is present, tip in the region of the SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax is identified. Compared to the prior study, there improved aeration in the left upper zone, though as noted, the left hemidiaphragm is quite elevated, obscuring the remainder of the lung. The presence of a left-sided effusion is suspected. The mediastinal contours and precise position of the mediastinum are not effectively evaluated. The right hemidiaphragm is obscured and there is likely a right pleural effusion with some degree of right base underlying collapse and/or consolidation. However, the right upper and mid zones are grossly clear. Doubt significant CHF -- previously seen vascular plethora has improved.
