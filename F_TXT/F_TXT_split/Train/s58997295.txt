The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The aorta is tortuous. Pulmonary vasculature is normal and the hilar contours are stable. Streaky linear opacities in both lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities present. Scoliosis of the thoracic spine is again noted.
