As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.3 cm above the carina. The course of the nasogastric tube that is also new is unremarkable, the tip projects over the prepyloric region. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The bilateral parenchymal opacities are constant in appearance. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged as compared to the previous study.
