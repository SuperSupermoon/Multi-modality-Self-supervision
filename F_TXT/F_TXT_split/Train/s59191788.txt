The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates near the thoracic inlet, approximately 6 cm above the carina. The balloon is not well seen. The lung volumes are low. Allowing for technique, the cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are probably within normal range. The lungs appear clear. The extreme left costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded, but there is no evidence for pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
