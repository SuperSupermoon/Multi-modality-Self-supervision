Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. There has been interval increase in bilateral lower lobe opacities. This is most likely a combination of increasing atelectasis and probably layering pleural effusions. Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema is unchanged. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
