Some shift of the mediastinum to the right is seen which was also present to some effect on CT from ___, increased from chest radiograph from ___, likely relating to underlying volume loss in the right lung possibly related to fibrotic changes. There has been interval development in a large amount of opacity projecting over the right lung, most notably the right mid to lower lung. Differential diagnosis includes large area of infection with underlying atelectasis, neoplasm, pulmonary hemorrhage not excluded. The right costophrenic angle is also blunted and there may be a right pleural effusion. Left basilar opacities may relate to the patient's underlying interstitial disease; however, additional consolidation due to atelectasis, infection, aspiration, or other alveolar process is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess due to the right-sided opacity. Air-distended loops of bowel are again partially imaged in the upper abdomen.
