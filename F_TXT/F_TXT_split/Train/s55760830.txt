Hardware projecting over the cervical spine is again seen. There is increase in the size of the left pleural effusion with increased pulmonary vascular re-distribution. There is obscuration of both hemidiaphragms and it is unclear if this is due to volume loss or infiltrate. Compared to the prior study, the fluid status and the lower lobe volume loss/infiltrate is worsened, which is all superimposed on the chronic lung disease as seen previously.
