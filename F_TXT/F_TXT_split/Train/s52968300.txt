Mild pulmonary edema in the left lung has improved slightly since earlier in the day. Right lower lobe is densely consolidated, perhaps collapsed. Pleural effusion is presumed but not large. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette has a normal postoperative appearance, and in fact the heart is smaller today than it was preoperatively. Tip of the endotracheal tube is just above the sternal ___, no less than 7 cm from the carina and would need to be advanced 3 cm for standard placement. Swan-Ganz catheter tip projects over the main pulmonary artery. Midline and bilateral pleural drains in place. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
