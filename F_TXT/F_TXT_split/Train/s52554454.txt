The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly improved from the most recent prior study. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Dense calcification of the aortic knob is re-demonstrated. Deformity at the right lateral fourth rib is compatible with healed prior fracture. No acute displaced rib fractures are detected.
