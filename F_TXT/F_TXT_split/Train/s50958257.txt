Left-sided pacemaker/AICD device with single lead terminating in the right ventricle is unchanged. Moderate to severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. There are marked aortic knob calcifications. Lung volumes are low. This causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. There are no displaced fractures seen.
