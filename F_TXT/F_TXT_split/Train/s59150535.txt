The ET tube terminates in the mid trachea. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach, distal tip not visualized. A right PICC line terminates in the upper right atrium. Bilateral airspace opacities have increased on the left and at the right base. Small layering pleural effusion and basilar subsegmental atelectasis are stable. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is magnified by the projection but stable. Gaseous distention of the stomach has increased despite the presence of a nasogastric tube.
