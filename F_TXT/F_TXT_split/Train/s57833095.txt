There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 5.0 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, terminating in the left upper quadrant in the expected location of the stomach. A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium. There is also a dual-lumen right-sided central venous catheter which terminates in the right atrium which appears to have advanced 3 cm since the prior study. There is marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, likely somewhat accentuated due to supine AP portable technique. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is again seen. No discrete focal consolidation is seen on the current study. It would be difficult to exclude trace pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
