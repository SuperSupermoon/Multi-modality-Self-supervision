Since the prior chest radiograph performed 1 day earlier, there has been interval repositioning of the left PICC, which now terminates in the low SVC. There has otherwise been no relevant interval change. Lungs are clear of consolidation, sizeable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
