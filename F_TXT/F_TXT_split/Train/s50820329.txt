Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiomediastinal contours. Bibasilar retrocardiac opacities are likely due to atelectasis in the recent postoperative setting. A lucency adjacent to the left hemidiaphragm is not fully evaluated on this semi upright radiograph. Considering clinical question of evaluating for free intraperitoneal air, either a fully upright chest radiograph or a left lateral decubitus abdominal radiograph would be recommended to exclude this possibility.
