In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a left subclavian catheter that extends to the mid to lower portion of the SVC. The endotracheal tube now is about 3.5 cm above the carina and the nasogastric tube extends to the distal stomach. There is the vague suggestion of asymmetric opacification at the bases, more prominent on the left. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered.
