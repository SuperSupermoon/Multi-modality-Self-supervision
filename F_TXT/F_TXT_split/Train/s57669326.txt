Persistent heterogeneous consolidation at the right base is more likely slowly improving pneumonia than pulmonary contusion or atelectasis. At the left base a much milder region of peribronchial infiltration has worsened. This could be recent aspiration. Upper lungs are clear. There is no edema, pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. Heart is normal size. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
