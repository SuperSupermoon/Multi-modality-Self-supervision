As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a moderate right and a small left pleural effusion that are likely unchanged. A mild right lung parenchymal opacity could reflect pneumonia. Given the clinical presentation of the patient, short-term radiographic followups are indicated. There is an unchanged evidence of retrocardiac atelectasis.
