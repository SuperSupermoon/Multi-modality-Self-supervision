In comparison with the study ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. There has been increased opacification at the left base with silhouetting hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and possible small pleural effusion. Otherwise, little change.
