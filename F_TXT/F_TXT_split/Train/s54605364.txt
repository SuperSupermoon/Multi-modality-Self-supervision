Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Mild atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Minimal streaky and linear opacities in the right lung base likely reflect areas of atelectasis. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely reflects a small amount of pleural thickening, not changed in the interval. No pneumothorax is seen. There are mild degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
