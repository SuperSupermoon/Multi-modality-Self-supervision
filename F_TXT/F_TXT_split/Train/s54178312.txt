Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right central venous line tip is at the cavoatrial junction, potentially can be present in a proximal right atrium and its reposition for 1 cm more proximally might be considered. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Bibasal atelectasis is present, unchanged on the right, but new on the left, which potentially might reflect developing infection. Attention to this area on the subsequent studies is recommended. Rest of the lungs are essentially clear. Opacity in the right mid lung can be seen dating back to ___ and although relatively stable, should further be assessed since its nature is unclear. Correlation with chest CT is considered at some point.
