There has been interval placement of a left Port-A-Cath which terminates in the superior cavoatrial junction. The lungs are well expanded and clear. Some scarring is seen in the right mid-lung, consistent with prior resection. Calcified granulomas are again noted in the right lung. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
