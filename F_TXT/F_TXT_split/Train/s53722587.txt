The cardiac silhouette size is normal. The mediastinal contour is unchanged with atherosclerotic calcification noted of the thoracic aorta. Right basilar chest tube remains in unchanged position, with a similar appearance of the small right pleural effusion. No large left pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Streaky opacities in the lung bases, more pronounced on the right, likely reflect atelectasis. There is likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion with cephalization of pulmonary vasculature.
