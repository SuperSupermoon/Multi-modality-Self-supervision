There has been interval placement of a right sided chest tube with near-resolution of the right pneumothorax. There may just be a minimal right residual pneumothorax, similarly to the left side, which also has a chest tube in place. The previously described needle-like opacity projecting over the right axilla is no longer present. There is stable severe cardiomegaly.
