There are low lung volumes with accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Patient's chin overlies the medial lungs apices. Given the above, there is bibasilar atelectasis. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Perihilar opacities suggest mild pulmonary edema. Left perihilar opacity most likely relates to pulmonary edema rather than focal consolidation. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable.
