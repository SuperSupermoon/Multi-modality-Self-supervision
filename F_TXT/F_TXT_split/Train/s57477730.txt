AP chest compared to 2:02 p.m.: There has been no appreciable increase in small, if any, left pleural effusion since 2:02 p.m. following removal of the left basal pigtail pleural catheter. No pneumothorax. Generalized lymphatic engorgement, lung nodules and moderate right pleural effusion are unchanged. Improved aeration is probably due to decrease in a component of pulmonary edema. Heart size top normal. Infusion port ends in the right atrium.
