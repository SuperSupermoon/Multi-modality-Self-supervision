Single AP portable semi-upright view of the chest was provided. There is left lung base opacification which could represent a combination of effusion and atelectasis though pneumonia cannot be excluded. A trace right pleural effusion is also seen. There is mild interstitial congestion. Heart size is difficult to assess. Atherosclerotic calcifications along the aortic knob noted. Patient is slightly rotated to his left somewhat limiting the evaluation. No pneumothorax. The imaged osseous structures appear intact.
