AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier at 07:44 a.m. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Left chest tube is in place with unchanged appearance of the left pleural effusion. Right pleural effusion is unchanged as well, both moderate to large. There is no interval change in increased cardiac silhouette as compared to the prior examination. Upper lungs are essentially clear except for vascular engorgement and upper zone re-distribution.
