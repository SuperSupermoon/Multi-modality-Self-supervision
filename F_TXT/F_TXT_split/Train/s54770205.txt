As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube has also been removed. The right internal jugular vein catheter is in unchanged position. The lung volumes have increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. Moderate cardiomegaly with minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No evidence of pleural effusions. No pneumonia.
