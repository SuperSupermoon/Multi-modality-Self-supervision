A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. Lung volumes are low. The lungs are clear. There is no focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is still normal, but azygous and mediastinal veins are mildly dilated, perhaps an indication of right heart dysfunction or other cause of elevated central venous pressure. Clinical correlation would be wise.
