AP chest compared to ___: Some of the increased widening of the mediastinum at and just below the thoracic inlets can be attributed to supine positioning and volume overload, but hemorrhage or other acute fluid accumulation must be considered clinically. Left lower lobe is largely consolidated, whether this is atelectasis alone or pneumonia possibly due to aspiration is radiographically indeterminate. Heart is quite large, but not appreciably changed, although vascular congestion in the right lung is more pronounced. Dr. ___ was paged as soon as the findings were recognized.
