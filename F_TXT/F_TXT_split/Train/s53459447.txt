Low lung volumes limits evaluation. A left chest wall Port-A-Cath is seen with its tip in the region of the mid SVC. A metallic stent projects over the right upper quadrant. Lower lung atelectasis noted. Difficult to assess lung bases for subtle pneumonia. No convincing evidence for pneumonia, large effusion or pneumothorax. The overall heart size is difficult to assess. Mediastinal contour is normal. Bony structures are intact. No free air seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
