Interval placement of a fiducial seed at the site of a left upper lobe lung nodule with no evidence of pneumothorax. The known nodule has been more fully evaluated by recent chest CT, and newly present poorly defined opacities surrounding the nodule probably represent hemorrhage in the setting of recent procedure. Heart is normal in size. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by interstitial edema. New patchy lower lobe opacities may be due to patchy atelectasis or aspiration.
