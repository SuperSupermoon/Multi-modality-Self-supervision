The ET tube is 4.5 cm above the carina. Right-sided chest tube is against the spine. Sternal wires are again visualized. Again seen are indistinct pulmonary vessels and diffuse areas of alveolar and interstitial opacity. The overall appearance is of that of the chronic known interstitial fibrosis with superimposed pulmonary edema. The acute pulmonary edema is slightly worse compared to prior study.
