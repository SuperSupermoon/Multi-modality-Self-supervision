AP view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which accentuate bronchovascular markings. There is persistent left lung base heterogeneous opacity, which obscures left hemidiaphragm. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive of trace pleural effusion. Trace right pleural effusion is also likely. There is no pulmonary edema. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax.
