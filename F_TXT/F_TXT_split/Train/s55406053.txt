The lung volumes are noted. There is confluent opacity in the left lung base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm with additional patchy region slightly superior to the cardiac silhouette. Elsewhere the lungs are clear. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but likely exaggerated by low lung volumes. Rightward tracheal deviation with increased soft tissue at the upper mediastinum is compatible with left-sided thyroid enlargement. No acute osseous abnormalities identified. Impression
