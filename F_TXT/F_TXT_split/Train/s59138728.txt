Previously visualized right medial basal parenchymal opacity has increased in comparison to the prior study. Additionally, there is new increased opacification of the left lower lobe. These findings are most suggestive of an infectious process, possibly due to aspiration. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remains stable with moderate cardiomegaly. No large pleural effusion is identified but there is blunting of bilateral hemidiaphragms and small pleural effusions may be present. No pneumothorax.
