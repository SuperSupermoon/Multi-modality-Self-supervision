Lung volumes are markedly low which limits evaluation. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There are streaky opacities throughout the right lung which likely represent atelectasis or infection in the appropriate setting. Scattered left basal opacities also likely reflect atelectasis or infection. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Of note, a tubular, radiopaque density projects over the left hemi thorax which may be related to the patient's left scapula.
