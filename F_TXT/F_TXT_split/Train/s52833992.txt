Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There is subtle increase in opacity at the left lung base which may be due to technique or atelectasis, less likely consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The aorta is tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Evidence of degenerative changes is seen along the spine.
