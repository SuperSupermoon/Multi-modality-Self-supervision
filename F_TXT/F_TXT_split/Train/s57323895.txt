Patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including moderate cardiomegaly. What is new is bilateral opacification of each lung base, which is especially confluent in the retrocardiac region on the left. Particularly on the right, small coinciding pleural effusion is suspected. Indistinct pulmonary vasculature appears mildly distended suggesting coinciding vascular congestion.
