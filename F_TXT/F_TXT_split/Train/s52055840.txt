A right PICC terminates at the mid SVC. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube extends to at least the level of the stomach, with the tip excluded from the field of view. Moderate pulmonary edema appears slightly improved since the ___ examination. There is no pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.
