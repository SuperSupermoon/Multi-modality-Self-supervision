AP chest compared to ___ postoperative chest radiograph ___, ___:43 p.m.: Since ___, fluid has begun to accumulate in the left hemithorax and the mediastinum has partially returned to the midline. Left pleural drain is in place. The lobulated left mediastinal contour is unchanged. This configuration could be due to augmentation of the left bronchial stump by relatively large volume of tissue such as omentum or subphrenic fat, or it could be due to large burden of clot. Dr. ___ was paged at 11:00 a.m., when the findings were recognized. The right lung is low in volume but clear. Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall is new, probably a function of accumulating fluid in the left pleural space, displacing air. An epidural catheter is at the T2-T3 level. The heart size is obscured by the mediastinal abnormality described, but there is no evidence of cardiomegaly.
