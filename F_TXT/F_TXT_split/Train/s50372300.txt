Frontal radiograph of the chest. Fine detail is obscured by overlying trauma board. Technique and positioning likely accentuate the heart and mediastinal contours. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A round 17 mm structure over the seventh posterior rib could be external to the patient, but recommend PA lateral radiographs or chest CT when clinically stable. No displaced rib fracture identified.
