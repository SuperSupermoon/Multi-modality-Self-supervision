Single portable view of the chest. Left PICC is seen with tip in the mid SVC. There is an opacity projecting over the anterior right 2nd rib, potentially related to osseous structures however underlying parenchymal changes are also possible. The lungs are otherwise grossly clear. The descending thoracic aorta is tortuous and may account for apparent left hilar enlargement. There is however possible right hilar enlargement as well. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged even given technique. No acute osseous abnormality detected.
