A feeding tube is seen with its tip in the stomach and would need to be advanced at least 7 cm for all the side ports to be past the GE junction. Again seen is bilateral pulmonary edema which is mildly improved from the prior study. Bilateral pleural effusions are largely unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The heart size is top normal.
