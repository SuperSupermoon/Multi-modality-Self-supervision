AP single chest view was obtained with patient in semi-erect position. The findings are compared with the next preceding study which was obtained 9 minutes earlier. An NG tube which on the previous study was curled up in the stomach and its tip reversed backwards through the hiatus into the lower esophagus has now been withdrawn resulting in a smaller loop within the fundus of the stomach. Still the line tip points in retrograde fashion into the esophagus. It is recommended to accomplish this line placement under fluoroscopic control. No other interval changes are seen on this portable examination which is the third portable chest examination for the same day.
