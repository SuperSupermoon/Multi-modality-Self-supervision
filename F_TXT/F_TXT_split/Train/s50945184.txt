Heart is normal size and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. New since ___ is extensive consolidation in the right mid lung, obscuring the right heart border, but affecting more than the right middle lobe. This is either developing pneumonia or traumatic pulmonary hemorrhage, depending upon clinical history. The left lung is generally clear, and there is no appreciable pleural abnormality, either effusion or pneumothorax. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT scanning. Stomach and splenic flexure are moderately distended.
