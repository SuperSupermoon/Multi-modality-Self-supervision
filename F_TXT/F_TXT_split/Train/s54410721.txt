Comparison to ___. New parenchymal opacities are visualized at the bases of the left lung and of the right lung. The opacities are ill-defined and show air bronchograms. Similar but smaller opacities are seen at the basis of the right upper lobe. In the appropriate clinical setting, the findings are highly suggestive of pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the presence of a small pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Left PICC line in stable position.
