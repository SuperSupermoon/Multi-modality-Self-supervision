AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Pulmonary vascular congestion was present on ___, subsequently improved. The coarse reticulation in the left upper lobe has been a constant feature. I suspect it is due to combination of vascular engorgement and substantial emphysema or bronchiectasis. Just to the left of the left hilus is a region that could be a small focus of consolidation, more pronounced today than previously and therefore concerning for pneumonia. The stomach is at least moderately distended with air and fluid. If clinical status of the lungs is uncertain, I would strongly recommend CT scanning.
