Right pectoral Port-A-Cath, the intravascular part of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the mid-to-low SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The image is acquired in a slightly lordotic projection, causing apparent mild cardiomegaly. No other relevant changes. Bilaterally, healed rib fractures might be present.
