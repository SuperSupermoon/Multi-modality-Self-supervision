The ETT tip ends approximately 2 cm from the carina. An enteric tube traverses the diaphragm and its tip is not visualized. The stomach is non-distended. The tip of the left internal jugular line projects over the mid SVC. Retrocardiac opacity appears less conspicuous on today's exam. Bilateral focal opacities persist but are improved from the prior exam and likely represent combination of multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema. Mild cardiomegaly persists and is unchanged. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is unchanged and suggests small pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Incompletely visualized spinal hardware appears intact.
