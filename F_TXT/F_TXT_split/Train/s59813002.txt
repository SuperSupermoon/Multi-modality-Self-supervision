As compared to ___ radiograph, bilateral heterogeneous pulmonary opacities with combined alveolar and interstitial features have progressed, with increased confluence at the lung bases. Scattered cystic lucencies raise the possibility of underlying cavitary lesions, which could be confirmed or excluded by standard PA and lateral radiographs or CT scan when the patient's condition permits. Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged as well as widespread sclerotic metastasis.
