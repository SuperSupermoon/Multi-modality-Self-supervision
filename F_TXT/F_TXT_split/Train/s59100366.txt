There is an ET tube which terminates 8 mm above the carina. This could be safely retracted 2 cm for proper positioning in the trachea. There is no OG tube seen. There is a widened appearance to the mediastinum, most prominently in the right paratracheal region. The differential includes lymphadenopathy, large mass, or hemorrhage emanating from a mediastinal great vessel. There are low lung volumes. There is retrocardiac opacification and obscuring of the left hemidiaphragm likely due to left lower lobe atelectasis. There is right basilar platelike atelectasis.
