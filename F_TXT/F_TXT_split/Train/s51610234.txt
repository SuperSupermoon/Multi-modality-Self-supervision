There has been some interval improvement but persistent mild pulmonary and perihilar edema. In addition, there is more focal consolidation in the retrocardiac area with the suggestion of air bronchograms. These findings may reflect pneumonia or aspiration rather than partial lower lobe atelectasis. Clinical correlation is advised. There are likely small layering pleural effusions, left greater than right. No pneumothorax. Heart remains stably enlarged.
