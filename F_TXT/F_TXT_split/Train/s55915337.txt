1. Interval removal of one of the two left-sided chest tubes. There continues to be a moderate-sized left pleural effusion with associated volume loss of the left lung. Overall, it appears that the left effusion may have slightly increased since removal of the chest tube. Overall, cardiac contour is difficult to assess due to the left side being obscured by the pleural and possibly associated airspace process. There is likely partial lower lobe atelectasis. The right lung remains well inflated and is grossly clear. No pneumothorax is seen.
