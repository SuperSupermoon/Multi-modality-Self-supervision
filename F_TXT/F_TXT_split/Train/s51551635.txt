There has been interval placement of a left pigtail catheter with minimal improved aeration of the left mid lung but persistent opacification of the remainder of the left hemithorax. The pigtail catheter appears somewhat folded distally. Large left pneumothorax is decreased in size with return of the mediastinum to midline. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. The left heart border is obscured and heart size is not well evaluated. A left pacemaker has leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. A right PICC terminates in the mid SVC. Atelectasis at the right base is unchanged. There is no large pneumothorax. The thoracic aorta is calcified.
