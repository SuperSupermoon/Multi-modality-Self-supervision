Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size cannot be assessed due to very high position of the diaphragm, obscuring the cardiac silhouette. Mediastinum is grossly unremarkable. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is suspected. No focal consolidation is seen. No pleural effusion is demonstrated.
