A right central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium. A Y-stent is in unchanged position. A left central venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC. There is a stable right upper lobe opacity consistent with right upper lobectomy. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Persistent mediastinal widening is due to distention of the mediastinal veins suggesting a component of volume overload. The right lung is however better aerated. There is mild pulmonary edema of the left lung. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no large pneumothorax. The gastric fundus is distended.
