1. Mild cardiomegaly. 2. Likely background COPD. 3. Abnormal opacities in both lungs, most pronounced in the mid and upper zones. These are of indeterminate chronicity, with an extensive differential. The differential includes infectious and inflammatory infiltrates as well as changes due to a chronic fibrotic process. Aspiration is also in the differential. This could also represent an atypical distribution of CHF, though that is considered less likely. An atypical presentation of neoplastic process is also considered less likely, but cannot be entirely excluded. 4. Rounded density right lung apex medially--___ artifact due to overlying soft tissues. Attention to this area on followup films is recommended.
