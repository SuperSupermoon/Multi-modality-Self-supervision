There is persistent elevation the right hemidiaphragm with consequent low lung volumes on the right. The left lung appears grossly clear. There may be a tiny left pleural effusion. A nasogastric tube is in-situ, the tip is just below the left hemidiaphragm and the spinal appears to be at approximately the level the gastroesophageal junction. This could be advanced for better position within the stomach. No consolidation seen. No pulmonary edema.
