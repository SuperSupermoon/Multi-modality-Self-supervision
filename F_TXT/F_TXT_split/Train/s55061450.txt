The patient has been intubated. Endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above the carina. Orogastric tube again passes into the stomach, and off the inferior margin of the film. The left subclavian line is in unchanged position, extending to the upper SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. Lung volumes are low, with resultant bronchovascular crowding, and possible mild vascular congestion. No frank pulmonary edema, and no focal opacity to suggest pneumonia.
