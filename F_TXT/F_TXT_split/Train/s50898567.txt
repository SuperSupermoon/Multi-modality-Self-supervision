The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The heart appears likely at the upper limits of normal size although not optimally assessed. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is a confluent right infrahilar opacity in the right lower lung with Kerley B lines and blunting of the right cardiophrenic angle, quite asymmetric. Patchy retrocardiac opacity is less specific but an additional focus of pneumonia could be considered versus atelectasis. There is mild background perihilar fullness suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension or slight fluid overload, but not substantial. Each costophrenic sulcus is blunted which may suggest pleural effusions.
