AP chest compared to ___: Moderately severe pulmonary edema continues to clear, while moderate bilateral pleural effusions increased and moderate left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged. The heart is moderately enlarged, bigger today than on ___. Any contribution of pericardial effusion would be difficult to determine without echocardiography or CT scanning. There is a suggestion of new consolidation in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, but this could be residual edema. I would recommend a repeat chest radiograph, if there are any findings clinically to suggest pneumonia. Dr. ___ was paged at 11 a.m.
