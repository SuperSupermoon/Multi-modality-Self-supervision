Both lung volumes and the severity of generalized opacification in both lungs have improved. It is not possible to see the margins of vessels in the left lung. Some pleural effusion, probably substantial is still present on both sides of the chest, left greater than right. Erect frontal or lateral radiography would be helpful in determining the volume of pleural fluid. The esophageal tube passes into the stomach and out of view. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements. A section of thin bore tubing crosses the thoracic inlet from the left to right and loops in the midline above the mandible. It needs to be identified by the clinical house staff to make sure that it is not a feeding tube looped in the hypopharynx.
