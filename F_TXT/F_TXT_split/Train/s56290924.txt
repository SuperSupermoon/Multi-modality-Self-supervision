Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is increased opacity at the right lung with likely right lower lobe and right middle lobe collapse. There is only a small portion of right upper lobe which is aerated. The left lung appears relatively well aerated with some minimal prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings. Discussed with the clinical team.
