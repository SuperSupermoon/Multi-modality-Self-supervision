Single frontal view of the chest. Left subclavian central line terminates in the mid SVC. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are noted. There is an opacity at the right lung base, at least part of which looks like is due to pleural fluid tracking along the fissure. Medially, the opacity may represent focal atelectasis, but cannot rule out pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
