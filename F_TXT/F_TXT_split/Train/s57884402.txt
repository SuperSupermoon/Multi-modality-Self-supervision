Since the most recent examination, both right-sided chest tubes have been repositioned. The overall volume of the previous moderate right pleural effusion has decreased and, at the base of the right hemi thorax pleural fluid has been replaced by a small volume of pneumothorax. Residual primarily right mid lung opacity is seen, which represents atelectasis. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. The pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.
