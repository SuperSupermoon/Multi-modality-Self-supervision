Upright portable view of the chest demonstrates right internal jugular central venous catheter tip projecting over mid SVC. Dual-chamber pacemaker leads are in unchanged position. Lung volumes are low, which accentuate bronchovascular markings. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. Left costophrenic angle is blunted, suggestive of possible small pleural effusion. There is no right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Heart is mildly enlarged. Left atrium is prominent. Heavy aortic arch calcifications are noted. Bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis.
