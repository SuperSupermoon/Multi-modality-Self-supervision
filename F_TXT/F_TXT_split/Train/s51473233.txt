AP chest compared to ___: Lungs are reasonably well expanded. At the left lower paraspinal lung base, a small area of abnormal lung is more likely atelectasis than pneumonia. The appearance of the posterior mediastinum and paraspinal region is unchanged, but this examination is not sensitive for detecting abnormalities in the operative bed. Lungs are otherwise clear, heart size is normal and there is no appreciable pleural effusion or indication of pneumothorax.
