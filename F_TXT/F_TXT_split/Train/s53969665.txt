The patient is status post right upper lobe resection. Consolidative opacities centrally in the right mid lung region appear slightly better, with improved aeration and better visibility of the right heart border. However, a more homogeneous peripheral opacity in the right mid and lower lung appears worse, and appears to correspond to both pleural and parenchymal abnormalities on recent CT of ___. Within the left lung, there is worsening retrocardiac opacification as well as slight increase in size of a small left pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, consistent with known pericardial effusion; persistent pulmonary vascular congestion and improving edema.
