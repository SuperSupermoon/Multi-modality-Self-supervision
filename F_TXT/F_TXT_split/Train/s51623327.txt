In comparison with the study of ___, following bronchoscopy there has been substantial Re aeration of the right lung. Areas of opacification persist, in the right mid and lower zones which could reflect some re-expansion edema, residual atelectasis, or even superimposed aspiration or pneumonia. The left lung is essentially clear. The endotracheal tube remains in good position. The nasogastric tube extends to the mid body of the stomach, where it coils back on itself so that the tip is pointing upwards just below the level of the esophagogastric junction.
