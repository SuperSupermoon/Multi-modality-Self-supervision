1. Interval intubation with endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 4 to 4.5 cm above the carina. Interval placement of left subclavian central line with its tip in the upper-to-mid SVC. Bilateral mediastinal drains remain in place. A relative hyperlucency of the left costophrenic sulcus may represent an anterior pneumothorax. Clinical correlation is advised. Persistent subcuatneous emphysema of the chest wall musculature. Overall, the lung volumes have increased with improved aeration at both bases, although there continue to be patchy bibasilar opacities most likely representing atelectasis in the setting of layering effusions, right greater than left. No pulmonary edema. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours stable in this post-operative patient status post median sternotomy. Old left posterolateral rib fracture and old left midclavicular fracture. No acute bony abnormality.
