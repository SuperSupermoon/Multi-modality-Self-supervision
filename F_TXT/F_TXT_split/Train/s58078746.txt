A tracheostomy tube is in place. The patient is status post median sternotomy. A right pleural pigtail catheter again projects over the right costophrenic angle. A left PICC is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the upper to mid SVC. A right PICC is again noted with the tip terminating at the level of the right axilla. There is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax. There is slightly increased opacification of the left lung base likely reflecting a combination of moderate left pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis or consolidation. Right basilar atelectasis is slightly improved from the most recent prior study. Enlargement of the cardiac mediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Calcification of the aortic knob and descending thoracic aorta is re- demonstrated.
