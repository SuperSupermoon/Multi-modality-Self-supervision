Lung volumes are low. Heart size is accentuated as a result of low lung volumes and appears mildly to moderately enlarged, unchanged. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted without overt pulmonary edema. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Oral contrast material is seen within the stomach.
