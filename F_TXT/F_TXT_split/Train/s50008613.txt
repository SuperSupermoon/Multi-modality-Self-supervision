No previous images. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette probably with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Increased opacification is seen at the right base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm but visualization of vessels coursing through the area. This could represent pleural fluid with compressive atelectasis, though the possibility of supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. If clinically possible, a lateral view would be most helpful.
