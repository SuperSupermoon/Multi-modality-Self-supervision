As compared to the chest x-ray of the same day at 12:36, there has been interval increase in opacification of the right lower lobe, compatible with a combination of increased atelectasis and pleural effusion, suspicious for pneumonia. Right upper lobe and left lung are still clear. Heart size is still moderately enlarged, with aorta mildly elongated. There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
