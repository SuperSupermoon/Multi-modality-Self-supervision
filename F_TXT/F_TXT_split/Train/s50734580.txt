Allowing for rotation, marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Single-lead ICD remains in place with lead terminating in the right ventricle, and note is made of previous median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery. Small pleural effusions are again demonstrated as well as adjacent basilar atelectasis. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
