Endotracheal tube tip in good position. Enteric tube tip in the proximal stomach, side hole near gastroesophageal junction, should be advanced. Right-sided venous catheter tip near cavoatrial junction. Mild to moderate left pleural effusion, probably similar allowing for difference in patient positioning. . Improved left perihilar opacity. Stable left basilar consolidation, likely atelectasis. Stable right basilar opacities. Probable trace right pleural effusion. Heart size, pulmonary vascularity has mildly improved, partially secondary to improved inspiration.
