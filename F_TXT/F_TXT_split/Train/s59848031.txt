Projectional differences limit comparison. With this limitation in mind, an area of consolidation in the right lower lobe appears slightly improved, and may be due to improving pneumonia, aspiration or an asymmetrical focus of edema. Additionally, there has been slight decrease in distention of pulmonary vascular structures with associated improving interstitial edema. Small right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size, and there is a questionable new left pleural effusion.
