AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. A Dobbhoff line is again identified and seen to terminate in similar position in the proximal stomach. Apparently some small amount of contrast medium has been injected demonstrating the surrounding mucus folds of the stomach. The upper portion of the image includes partially the lower neck area where one can indeed identify redundant loops of the line within the oropharyngeal area. In spite of this, the Dobbhoff line has reached the stomach.
