Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular introducer has been removed. Lung volumes remain low with patchy opacities at both bases, right greater than left, likely representing bibasilar atelectasis, although pneumonia and aspiration should also be considered. Perihilar vasculature is prominent and the vasculature is somewhat indistinct suggesting the presence of mild interstitial edema. No pneumothorax.
