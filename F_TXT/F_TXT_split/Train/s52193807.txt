AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. Heart size appears unchanged paying attention to difference between PA and AP frontal views. The pulmonary vasculature is not more congested than it was before. Significantly lower inspirational effort explains the relatively high-positioned diaphragms in comparison with the previous study. This results in a somewhat more crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature, but no evidence of local discrete pulmonary infiltrates can be established on this single view chest examination. Also, the lateral pleural sinuses remain free from any fluid accumulation. Callus formations are noted overlying the previously described lower left hemithorax rib fractures level ___ 7 and 8. No pneumothorax is identified.
