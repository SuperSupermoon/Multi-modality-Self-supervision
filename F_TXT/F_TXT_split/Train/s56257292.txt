In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a right chest tube with a small to moderate amount of pleural effusion. No recent images available for comparison. No definite pneumothorax. Increased opacification at the right base could reflect some combination of atelectasis, superimposed pneumonia, or even re-expansion edema. On the left, there is a larger pleural effusion, similar or even increased from the prior study.
