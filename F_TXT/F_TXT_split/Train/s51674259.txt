Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is mildly enlarged. Aortic knob is calcified. Apparent superior mediastinal widening is likely due to low lung volumes. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced in the retrocardiac region could reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
