The carina is difficult to identified definitively but the ET tube is approximately 1.5 cm from its expected location. Low lung volumes are noted with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings. There is no confluent consolidation. Prominence of the mediastinum is may be due to portable technique and low lung volumes. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
