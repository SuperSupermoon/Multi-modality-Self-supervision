Single view chest radiograph shows interval increase of left lung opacification, likely for increase of pleural effusion. The left pleural drain tip ends medially in the left upper lung and might be intrafissural, its function should be checked. Right lung volumes still low with minimal right base atelectasis, but without consolidation. Heart size appears still mildly enlarged, partially obscured by the left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged.
