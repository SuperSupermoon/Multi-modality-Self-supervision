Endotracheal tube has been partially withdrawn, now ends one cm above the carina, at least 2-3 cm below optimal position. Left lower lobe remains collapsed. Heterogeneous opacification in the lungs is probably largely pulmonary edema, improved except in the right lower lobe, where substantial atelectasis is the likely cause of airspace opacification. Borderline cardiomegaly unchanged. Right jugular Swan-Ganz catheter is been removed. Left jugular central venous line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
