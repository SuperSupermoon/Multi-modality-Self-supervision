The right internal jugular central venous catheter has been removed. Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The mediastinal contour is similar. No pulmonary edema is present, and the hilar contours are unchanged. There is minimal retrocardiac patchy opacity, likely atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected, however, the left costophrenic angle is not completely included in the field of view.
