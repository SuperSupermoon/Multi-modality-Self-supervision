Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained. Despite low lung volumes, vascular fullness and interstitial septal thickening suggest mild pulmonary edema. The heart is stably enlarged with a calcified aortic contour. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified, though the right costophrenic angle is not well evaluated and small effusion cannot be excluded.
