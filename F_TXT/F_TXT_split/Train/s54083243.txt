A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates intact sternal wires, mediastinal clips, and a left chest wall pacer device with the lead overlying the right ventricle. Heart size is top-normal to mildly enlarged. There is obscuration of the left heart border consistent with a lingular consolidation. Additional patchy opacities are noted in the right lower and upper lung. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
