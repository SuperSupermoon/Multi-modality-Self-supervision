Upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates increasing bibasilar opacities, with likely small bilateral pleural effusions, and an interval increase in pulmonary edema, now moderate in degree. Airspace opacity in the right upper lobe may reflect asymmetric edema or developing infection. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and is slightly increased in size compared with prior. The mediastinal contours are unchanged.
