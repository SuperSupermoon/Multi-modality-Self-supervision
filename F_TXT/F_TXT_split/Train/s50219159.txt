1. Nasogastric tube is seen, which courses below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach, although the entire course is not incompletely imaged. Lungs appear well inflated with patchy bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis. There is also likely an element of emphysema given the paucity of lung markings at the apices. Possible small left effusion. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable and within normal limits.
