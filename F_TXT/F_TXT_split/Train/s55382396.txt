Study is somewhat limited by low lung volumes and lordotic positioning. Indistinct consolidations in the left lower lobe worrisome for infection and perhaps a small effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size appears normal. There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath and the tip is in appropriate location. Surgical clips are seen projecting over the right axilla. Diffuse sclerotic lesions are seen throughout the bony structures and is compatible with known osseous metastases.
