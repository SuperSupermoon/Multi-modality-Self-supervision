In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a right subclavian PICC line. The tip is not optimally seen, though appears to be in the mid to lower SVC. The area of increased opacification in the left mid zone has increased in size. In the appropriate clinical setting, developing pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
