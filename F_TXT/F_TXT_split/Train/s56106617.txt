Low lung volumes are present. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with a left ventricular predominance is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Retrocardiac opacification is not substantially changed in the interval, and could reflect atelectasis, but infection is not completely excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Remote right-sided rib fractures are again noted. Diffuse gaseous distention of bowel loops within the upper abdomen are similar to the previous study.
