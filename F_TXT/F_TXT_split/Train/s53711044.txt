There is a left IJ central venous catheter which terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes are low. Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouettes likely relates to low lung volumes and AP technique. The hila are unremarkable. Mild prominence of the interstitium diffusely likely relates to crowding of normal bronchovascular structures. There is bibasilar atelectasis. There is no focal lung consolidation. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. It is difficult to exclude trace bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
