Right infrahilar consolidation persists, either atelectasis or pneumonia. Heart is mildly enlarged and pulmonary vasculature is engorged but I do not see pulmonary edema. Pleural effusion is small, on the right if any. No pneumothorax. Right supraclavicular central venous catheter passes at least to the low right atrium perhaps into the inferior vena cava. No left pleural effusion is present.
