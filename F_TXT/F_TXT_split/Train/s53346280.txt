As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of moderate pulmonary edema with a newly-appeared small left pleural effusion and left retrocardiac atelectasis. New plate-like atelectasis is also seen at the right lung base. In the interval, the patient has received a right hemodialysis catheter. The catheter is in correct position; there is no complication such as pneumothorax. The nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube are constant.
