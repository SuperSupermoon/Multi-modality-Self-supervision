Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position. Bilateral pulmonary opacities are more pronounced than the recent comparison radiograph; given the interval change this could reflect edema or aspiration superimposed upon the atelectasis and effusion seen on chest CT. The right upper lung opacity on chest CT is not as well seen on these films in part due to external material projecting over the right lateral upper chest. No pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac size is stable.
