1. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable post-operative cardiac and mediastinal contours. There has been interval improvement in aeration with residual mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema remaining. Lung volumes are slightly lower. There is possibly a small left effusion. The patient's mandible obscures the lung apices. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
