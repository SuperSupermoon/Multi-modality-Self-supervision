Bilateral combined alveolar and interstitial opacities have slightly improved; greater involvement in the lung bases likely represents gravitational differences in distribution of pulmonary edema, but followup radiographs after diuresis would be helpful to exclude other underlying process such as aspiration or infectious pneumonia at the lung bases. Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened, and a small left pleural effusion appears slightly more prominent than on the recent radiograph. There is also a probable small right pleural effusion but no visible pneumothorax.
