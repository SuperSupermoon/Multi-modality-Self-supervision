Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size is top normal, potentially exaggerated by the portable nature of the study. Mediastinum is stable. Right upper lobe paramediastinal opacity and pleural thickening might reflect chronic changes, but correlation with prior imaging is required to exclude acute process. Left lower lobe opacity and elevated left hemidiaphragm were noted and might reflect atelectasis or infectious process as well. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
