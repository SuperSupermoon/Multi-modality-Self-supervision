Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip most likely in the distal duodenum/proximal jejunum. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The ET tube tip is approximately 3 cm above the carina. The Swan-Ganz catheter tip is at the level of the right main pulmonary artery. The left internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Overall, the position of supporting tubes and lines is unchanged since the prior study. The patient is substantially rotated precluding precise evaluation of the left hemithorax, but within those limitations, no change in the left retrocardiac consolidation is seen. The patient has vascular engorgement, but no overt edema is demonstrated. Extensive changes in the right humeral head and the proximal humerus are consistent with remote injury, most likely fracture.
