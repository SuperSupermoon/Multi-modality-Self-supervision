The lung volumes are now lower. There is persistent mild pulmonary edema which is unchanged from ___, but shows considerable improvement from ___. Linear opacities over the lower lobes as well as obscuration of the diaphragmatic contours indicate persistent bibasilar atelectasis and left greater than right small effusion. Once again, asymmetric heterogeneous opacities, at times with a nodular pattern, are seen in the right upper lobe, raising concern for an infectious process. The cardiomediastinal contours are normal and there is no pneumothorax.
