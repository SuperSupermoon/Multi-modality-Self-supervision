Since the recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, left insular atelectasis has worsened. A new nonspecific opacity has developed in the right lower lobe, and could potentially be due to developing pneumonia based on appearance on CT abdomen of 1 day earlier. Small right and trace left pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
