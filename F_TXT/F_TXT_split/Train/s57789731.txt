Compared with the most recent priro filma and allowing for differences in technique, I doubt significsnt interval change. Again seen is an NG tube, nowslightly more urled, overlying the gastric fundus. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, including slight unfolding of the aorta, is similar to the prior film. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, with plate-like atelectasis at the right lung base and additional atelectasis in the cardiophrenic region. No CHF, focal consolidation, or gross effusion is identified. No obvious free air seen beneath the diaphgragm.
