AP portable view of the chest demonstrates bibasilar opacities, new since prior exam, right > left. Left costophrenic angle is obscured, suggestive of trace pleural effusion. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. The aortic arch calcifications are again noted. Mild cardiomegaly persists. There is no pneumothorax. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
