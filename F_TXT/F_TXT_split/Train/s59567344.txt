Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiac size is top normal. There are low lung volumes. Extensive bilateral opacities have improved in the lower lobes, consistent with improving pneumonia and improving atelectasis. There are no new lung abnormalities, pneumothorax, or enlarging pleural effusion. Lines and tubes are in standard position.
