Lung volumes are low. Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged with a left ventricular predominance, unchanged. The aorta remains markedly tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise similar. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases are nonspecific, and may reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Hypertrophic changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
