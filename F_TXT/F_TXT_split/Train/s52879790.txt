Patient has had median sternotomy. Lung volumes have improved slightly since ___, accounting for some but probably not all of the apparent decrease in moderate cardiomegaly. Severe bilaterally symmetric perihilar pulmonary consolidation has not worsened. The symmetry suggests pulmonary edema, usually cardiogenic but pulmonary hemorrhage in pneumonia are not excluded. Pleural effusions are small. There is no pneumothorax.
