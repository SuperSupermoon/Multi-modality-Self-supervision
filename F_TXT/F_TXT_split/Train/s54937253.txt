Interval intubation with tip of endotracheal tube terminating 3 cm above the carina. The left lung volumes are increased compared to the prior pre-intubation radiograph, and there is associated improved aeration at the lung bases. Otherwise, widespread pulmonary parenchymal and pleural abnormalities appear similar to the recent radiograph performed a few hours earlier. Note is also made of interval placement of nasogastric tube, terminating within the stomach.
