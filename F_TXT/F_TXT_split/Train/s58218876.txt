Compared to exam performed 6 hours prior, there is mild improvement of the right interstitial opacities, possibly due to better aeration. There is increased volume loss on the left with elevation of left hemidiaphragm and leftward mediastinal shift, likely due to lower lobe collapse and small amount of pleural fluid. The heart size is mildly enlarged. ETT terminates approximately 3.3 cm from the carina. There is no significant change in monitoring and support devices.
