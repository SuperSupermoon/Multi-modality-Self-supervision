1. Interval placement of two left-sided chest tubes. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. There is patchy opacity in the right upper lobe likely reflecting atelectasis given elevation of the minor fissure. Patchy opacity at the left base also likely reflects an area of patchy atelectasis, although aeration at the left base has overall improved. Stable widening of the mediastinal contours in this patient status post aortic surgery. Heart remains upper limits of normal in size given portable technique. Multiple rib fractures, unchanged. Spinal hardware is seen overlying the visualized upper lumbar spine. Prominent amount of gas within distended stomach.
