In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again extensive subcutaneous gas with the monitoring and support devices in place. Bibasilar opacifications are consistent with atelectatic change and probable right effusion as well as some elevated pulmonary vascular pressure. Apices are somewhat difficult to evaluate due to overlying bony structures. Although not optimally seen, there appears to be a right pleural line consistent with a small pneumothorax. Small pneumoperitoneum is probably persisting.
