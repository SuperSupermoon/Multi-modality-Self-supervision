A single frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. There is redemonstration of a left-sided pacemaker with associated right atrial and right ventricular leads, not significantly changed. There is new consolidation at the left lung base, representing some combination of atelectasis and/or infection as well as a small left pleural effusion. Streaky right lower lung opacities are likely secondary to atelectasis. There may be a small layering pleural effusion on the right. No pneumothorax is seen. The heart is mildly enlarged, slightly increased compared to the prior study. There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature.
