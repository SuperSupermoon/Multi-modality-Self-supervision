Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. A left internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle and tenting of the right hemidiaphragm suggestive of volume loss in the right lung which is likely postoperative. There continues to be more focal patchy opacity at both bases, although this has somewhat improved since the prior study. Findings would be consistent with resolving pulmonary edema with an atypical distribution due to underlying emphysema, less likely improving pneumonia. Note that the 2 cm spiculated peripheral right lower lobe mass seen on recent chest CT ___ is not radiographically apparent.
