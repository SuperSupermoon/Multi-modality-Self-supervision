The intrathoracic aorta is tortuous and there is mild widening of the mediastinum which is likely due to a combination of difference in technique compared to the prior study as well as increased mediastinal fat pad versus prominence of the brachiocephalic vessels. Lung volumes are low with streaky bibasilar opacities particularly at the right cardiophrenic angle which likely represent atelectasis or vascular crowding due to low lung volumes, however, infection cannot be excluded. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
