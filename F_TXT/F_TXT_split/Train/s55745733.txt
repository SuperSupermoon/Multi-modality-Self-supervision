Comparison is made to the previous study from ___ at 7:48 a.m. There is endotracheal tube, enteric tube and right IJ central line. The right-sided IJ line is within the mid right atrium and could be pulled back 2 to 3 cm for more optimal placement. There is persistent prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings and more focal areas of consolidation within the lower lobes. This is unchanged. There are no pneumothoraces.
