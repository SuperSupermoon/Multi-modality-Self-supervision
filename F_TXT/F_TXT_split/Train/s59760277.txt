Single portable supine AP image of the chest. There has been interval intubation of the patient, with the ET tube at the level of the aortic knob. An NG tube is seen terminating in the left upper quadrant. There are low lung volumes. Diffuse right greater than left increased interstitial prominence is seen, most consistent with asymmetric mild pulmonary edema, though pneumonia could have a similar appearance. No focal consolidation or mass is seen. The bilateral costophrenic angles are blunted, consistent with small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, similar to prior exam.
