Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a right IJ central venous line with distal lead tip in the mid SVC. The feeding tube and tracheostomy tube are unchanged. There is again seen cardiomegaly and diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally consistent with pulmonary edema. Multifocal pneumonia would also have to be considered. There is a left-sided pleural effusion and a left retrocardiac opacity as well. Overall these findings are stable.
