The patient has had previous esophagectomy. In comparison to the radiograph of 2 days prior, there is a new moderate right pneumothorax. The right pleural effusion has increased. Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis is unchanged. Mediastinal drains remain in place. Radiopaque contrast from a recently performed barium esophagram opacifies partially imaged loops of colon in the upper abdomen. The heart and mediastinum are magnified by the projection. The followup radiograph shows no appreciable change in the moderate right pneumothorax, but a significant increase in moderate right pleural fluid.
