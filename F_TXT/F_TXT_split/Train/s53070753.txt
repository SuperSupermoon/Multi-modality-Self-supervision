AP chest compared to ___: New aortic valve in place. No appreciable change in the mediastinum since preoperative study. Thoracic aorta is tortuous and heavily calcified, but there is no change in aortic contour or mediastinal caliber to suggest bleeding complications. Opacification in the left lower lobe is new, presumably atelectasis. Pleural effusion is minimal if any. No pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly stable. Right transjugular Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the proximal right pulmonary artery. Wire projecting over the left upper chest and right mediastinum is unclear to me. If it is a catheter or pacemaker lead, it ends in the mid SVC. It could be external. No pneumothorax.
