AP chest compared to 6:39 a.m. Mediastinum is no longer as severely shifted to the right, suggesting there may be an increase in small right pleural effusion, or the left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened. Right basal and apical pleural tubes are unchanged in their respective positions. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. Tip of the tracheostomy tube may abut the right wall of the trachea and should be evaluated clinically. Left subclavian line ends low in the SVC.
