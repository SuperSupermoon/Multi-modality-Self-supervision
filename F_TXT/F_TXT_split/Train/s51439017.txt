Supraglottic airway is not well demonstrated due to flexed position of the patient's neck. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits except for apparent slight obscuration of lower right heart border. This may simply be due to a prominent pericardial fat pad accentuated by patient rotation, but attention to this region on standard PA and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful when the patient's condition permits, in order to exclude a localized right middle lobe process. Lungs are otherwise clear. Questionable small pleural effusions, but no visible pneumothorax.
