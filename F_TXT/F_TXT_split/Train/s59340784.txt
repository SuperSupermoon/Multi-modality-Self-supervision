A right-sided indwelling catheter is present, tip at SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax detected. Note is made of asymmetry in the patient's breast shadows, smaller on the left. There appears to be some increased density over the left lung. Given the density of the left breast on the ___ CT, it is possible that this is accounted for by increased soft tissue density in the present. In addition, there is a nodular density at the left lung base, projecting adjacent to the left cardiac contour, measuring approximately 21 mm in diameter. Possible right base pulmonary nodules similar to the ___ film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is at the upper limits of normal. The right lung is grossly clear. Though the mediastinum appears midline, there does appear to be slight asymmetry in the lungs, slightly larger on the right. No CHF or right-sided opacity is detected. No effusion is detected on either side. Punctate density overlying the left neck may represent a small amount of carotid artery calcification.
