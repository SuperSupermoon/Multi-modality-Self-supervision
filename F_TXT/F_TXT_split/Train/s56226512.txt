Large left pneumothorax has increased despite placement of left pleural drain, raising questions about the location and/or function of the drain. By the time this study was available for review, 10:55 a.m., the left pneumothorax had been treated. No notification was necessary. There is no appreciable right pneumothorax, pleural drain in place. Severe atelectasis persists at the right lung base. Heart size normal, though rightward mediastinal shift suggests possibility of hemodynamic tension.
