Single portable view of the chest. Right-sided PICC is now seen with its tip in the upper SVC. Enteric tube passes below the diaphragm with tip in the gastric body, side-port past the GE junction. Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 4 cm from the carina, in appropriate position. Right basilar opacity is partially due to chronic rib changes similar to prior. The lungs are otherwise grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for technique. Surgical clips seen in the neck on the right suggesting prior thyroid surgery. Trachea is deviated to the left as on prior.
