Right IJ catheter tip projects over the expected region of the proximal right atrium, unchanged. Lung volumes remain low. Asymmetric appearance of the lungs has resolved, likely reflecting rotation on the prior exam and asymmetric edema. However, mild left lower lobe opacity persists, suggesting atelectasis. No pneumothorax. No large effusion.
