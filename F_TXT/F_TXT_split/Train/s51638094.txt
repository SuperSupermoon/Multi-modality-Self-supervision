The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged. Mitral annular calcifications are present. The aortic arch is calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Streaky basilar opacities are probably due to atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
