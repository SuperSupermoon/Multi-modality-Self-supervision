A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube which terminates approximately 2.7 cm above the carina, in the mid to low thoracic trachea. The heart is mildly enlarged. There is mild to moderate pulmonary edema, as well as a possible right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. It is difficult to evaluate for focal consolidation in the right lower lung, given overlying opacities. Allowing for this, no definite focal consolidation is identified.
