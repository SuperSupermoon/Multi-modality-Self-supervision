Heart size is normal. The aortic knob is calcified. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is no pulmonary edema. Ill-defined opacities within both lung bases are concerning for pneumonia or aspiration. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified. There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. Degenerative changes are also noted within the right shoulder with narrowing of the acromiohumeral interval suggestive of rotator cuff disease.
