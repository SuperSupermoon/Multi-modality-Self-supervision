Compared prior chest radiographs ___ through ___. Combination of multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema, emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis has been present radiographically for some time. However there has been worsening of pulmonary edema over the past 12 hr. I do not believe that the contour in the right upper hemi thorax is a pneumothorax. It is probably a skin fold. Postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Left jugular line ends in the low SVC.
