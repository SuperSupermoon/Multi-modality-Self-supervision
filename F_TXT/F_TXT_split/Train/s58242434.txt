A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates multiple sternotomy, a nasogastric tube, endotracheal tube, and left PICC, all of which are unchanged in position. The exam is not significantly changed from prior chest radiograph, and redemonstrates mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, as well as bibasilar atelectasis and a small to moderate left pleural effusion. Right base atelectasis may be slightly improved.
