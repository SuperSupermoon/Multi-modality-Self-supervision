Status post left-sided vats procedure. A left chest tube is in situ. There is no convincing evidence for the presence of the left postprocedural pneumothorax. On the right, the new esophagus is seen in almost unchanged manner. However, given the lower lung volumes, there are areas of atelectasis at the right lung bases. Moderate cardiomegaly. No pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions.
