Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The NG tube tip is seen projected over the left lower quadrant, most likely in the stomach. The right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Since the prior radiograph, there is interval development of left lower lobe opacity, peripheral that might reflect pleural effusion or less likely aspiration/interval development of infection. Continued attention to this area is recommended.
