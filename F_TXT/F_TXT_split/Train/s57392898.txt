Radiographs centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained to assess a nasogastric tube, which terminates in the distal stomach. Within the chest, cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique. Imaged portions of the lungs are clear except for minimal atelectasis at the lung bases. No pleural effusion is evident, but right costophrenic sulcus has been excluded from the study.
