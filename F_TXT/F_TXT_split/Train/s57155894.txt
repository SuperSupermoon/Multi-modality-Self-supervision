In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been replaced with a tracheostomy tube, which appears well seated without evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. The right subclavian PICC line is been pulled back so that the tip is in the lower SVC. Some increased opacification is again seen at the right base medially, consistent with the clinical impression of pneumonia in this region. Left lower lung opacification is again consistent with consolidation, probably with associated pleural effusion. The PEG tube is in place. There is dilatation of gas- filled loops of bowel. No definite pneumothorax, though this is not an upright view so that free intra-abdominal gas cannot be excluded.
