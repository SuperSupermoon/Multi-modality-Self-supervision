As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right-sided PICC line. The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the mid-to-low SVC. There is no evidence of complications, no pneumothorax. In the interval, the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased and there are mild areas of retrocardiac atelectasis. Also is a very mild increase in density at both lung bases, potentially suggesting the presence of minimal pleural effusions. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
