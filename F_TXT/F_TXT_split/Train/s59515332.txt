Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position except for a nasogastric tube with side port probably just above the GE junction level. Heart size is normal. Pulmonary vascular engorgement is accompanied by nonspecific bilateral upper lobe opacities, potentially due to asymmetrical pattern of edema or pneumonia superimposed upon known underlying emphysema. Worsening left lower lobe opacity is present accompanied by an increasing small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. No substantial change in right basilar atelectasis and small adjacent pleural effusion.
