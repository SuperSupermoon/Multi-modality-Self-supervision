Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately a 4.9 cm above the level the carina. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the stomach. Left-sided chest tube is seen, terminating at the left lung apex. No definite pneumothorax is seen. There is no large pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged. The mediastinum appears mildly widened which may be due to patient position and AP technique although acute mediastinal process is not excluded. Subtle right base opacity may be due to overlap of vascular structures or aspiration.
