In comparison with the earlier study, the endotracheal tube has been pushed forward so that the tip now lies approximately 4 cm above the carina. There has been progressive re-expansion of the left hemithorax, with now all relatively mild volume loss at the base and pleural fluid. The mediastinal structures are essentially mid line at this time. The right lung is essentially clear. Multiple rib fractures are again seen on the left.
