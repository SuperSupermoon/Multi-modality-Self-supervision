Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a new left IJ central line in place with the tip in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax or other complication seen. The chest appears otherwise unchanged from imaging earlier the same day. Large bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis are again seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
