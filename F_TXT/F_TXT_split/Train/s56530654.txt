Compared with earlier the same day, I doubt significant interval change. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Slight displacement of the cardiac silhouette by large right base bulla is again noted. Again seen are lobulated, partially calcified masses in both lung apices suggesting prior granulomatous disease and/or silicosis/ pneumoconiosis. There is minimal atelectasis at the left lung base, without significant change. No focal infiltrate or effusion is otherwise identified on this AP view. Old healed right-sided rib fractures again noted. A small nodular opacity in the right mid zone laterally overlying the right seventh rib posteriorly measures approximately 6.0 mm in corresponds to a noncalcified nodular density on the ___ CT scan (601b:24). Thin caliber appearance of the trachea within the chest raises question of saber sheath trachea/tracheomalacia.
