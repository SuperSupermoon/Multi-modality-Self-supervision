Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs remain hyperinflated with attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices suggestive of mild emphysema. Minimal atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
