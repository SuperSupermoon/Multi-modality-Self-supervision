In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a pigtail catheter with its tip at the cardiophrenic angle. No evidence of pneumothorax. Substantial reduction in the amount of fluid in the right chest with concomitant expanded aeration. Retrocardiac and left basilar opacification persist, consistent with atelectasis and effusion. The right central catheter has been re-positioned with the tip in the low SVC. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in good position.
