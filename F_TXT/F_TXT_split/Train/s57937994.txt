Midline tracheostomy tube is seen. There are relatively low lung volumes and persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Left base retrocardiac opacity is seen which could be due to atelectasis however, underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration may be present. No large pleural effusion is seen although trace pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
