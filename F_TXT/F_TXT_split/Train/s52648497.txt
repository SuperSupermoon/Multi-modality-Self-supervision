AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day. The right-sided chest tube remains in unchanged position terminating in the apical portion of the right hemithorax. No pneumothorax has developed. There is, however, a significant difference in the superior right-sided mediastinal structures, raising possibility of hemorrhage in this area. No other significant abnormalities can be identified. Referring physician, ___, was paged at 5:15 p.m. Discussion centered about the prominent superior mediastinal structures, but there is no clinical suspicion for any bleeding. The varying finding can be explained by more distended superior mesenteric veins. The patient will have routine followup chest examination tomorrow.
