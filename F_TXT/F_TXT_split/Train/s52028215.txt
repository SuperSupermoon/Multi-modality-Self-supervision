AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Heart size is borderline, without typical configurational abnormality. Thoracic aorta of normal ___ but with some calcium deposits in the wall at the level of the arch. There is some moderate degree of perivascular haze in the pulmonary circulation, but there is no conclusive finding for central parenchymal or basal interstitial pulmonary edema. Diffuse haze is overlying the lower half of the right hemithorax in the absence of any pleural fluid accumulation blunting the lateral pleural sinuses. Considering patient's significant recumbent position, it is possible that this haze relates to pleural effusion layering in the posterior pleural compartment. In the differential diagnosis, this density could of course also represent parenchymal infiltrates of inflammatory nature. Review of the latest transferred chest examination from ___ dated ___ demonstrated similar findings.
