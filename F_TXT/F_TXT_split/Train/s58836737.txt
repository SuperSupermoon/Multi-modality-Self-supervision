Comparison is made with prior study CT ___ and chest x-ray ___. Cardiac size is normal. Abnormal appearance of the mediastinum is due to known mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. There is no pneumothorax. Multiple lung nodules are better seen in prior CT. Faint opacity in the right hemithorax, especially due to superimposition of the breast implant but a lung opacity is likely also present, could be aspiration or, if there was BAL, is related with the procedure. There is no pneumothorax or large effusion.
