AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes have improved, previous mild pulmonary edema has decreased, and more focal consolidation in the right mid lung cleared over less than 48 hours.

No pneumothorax. Heart size mildly enlarged, pulmonary vasculature is still engorged. Small pleural effusion is likely. No detectable pneumothorax. Right jugular sheath ends at the origin of the right brachiocephalic vein.
