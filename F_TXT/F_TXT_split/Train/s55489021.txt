A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. The patient is markedly rotated limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. The aorta does appear prominent and unfolded. Patchy opacities at both lung bases may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Suture material overlying the left humeral head.
