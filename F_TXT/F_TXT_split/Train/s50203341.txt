In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease and extensive prominence of interstitial markings, consistent with fibrosis and emphysema seen on the recent CT scan. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, though this could be difficult to exclude in view of the extensive parenchymal changes and absence of a lateral view.
