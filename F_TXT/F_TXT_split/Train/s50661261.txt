Single frontal AP view of the chest provided demonstrates a dual-lead pacemaker with left chest wall pacer pack and dual leads seen extending into the region of the right atrium and right ventricle. Cardiomegaly is mild. There are diffuse parenchymal pulmonary opacities which are more confluent in the left upper and right lower lung which could represent pneumonia. There is likely underlying pulmonary edema. Small effusions likely present. The mediastinal contour appears grossly unremarkable. No pneumothorax. Bones are intact.
