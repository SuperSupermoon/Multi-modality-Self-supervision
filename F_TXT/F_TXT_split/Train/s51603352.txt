There has been interval worsening of chronic right pleural effusion and right lower lung collapse now with a moderate to large effusion, collapse of the right middle and right lower lobe, and heterogeneous opacity throughout the remainder of the right lung. A 2.1 cm nodule in the left lung apex is compatible with known malignancy. The remainder of the left lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal contour is not readily assessed due to opacification of much of the right hemithorax. Thoracic stabilization hardware is unchanged in position. Known thoracic vertebral fractures are not well assessed on this a portable frontal radiograph.
