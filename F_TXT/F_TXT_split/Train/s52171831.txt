The PICC ends at the junction of the upper and middle SVC, and has been pulled back since the prior radiograph. A pacemaker is in place with the leads seen in the left ventricle and right atrium. Sternal wires are intact and midline. Multiple clips are seen within the mediastinum. Since the prior radiograph, there has been resolution of the right pleural effusion. Opacification of the left base likely represents a persistent left effusion. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
