Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There are lower lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, are unchanged. Small left effusion is stable. There is no pneumothorax. Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC. There is mild vascular congestion. There are no new lung abnormalities. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated, is obscured by the pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.
