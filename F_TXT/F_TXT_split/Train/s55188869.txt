The endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube passes into the distended stomach, tip off the inferior margin of the film. Lung volumes are low. Even accounting for this, there is cardiomegaly that appears worsened from one day prior. Additionally, there is widening of the vascular pedicle, compatible with central vascular congestion, as well as small right and possible left pleural effusion. In this setting, and given the relative normal appearance of the lungs on recent comparison studies, diffuse parenchymal opacities most likely reflect pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. There is no free air is seen in the upper abdomen.
