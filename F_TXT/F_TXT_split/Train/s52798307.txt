AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: There is no consolidation or atelectasis. A vague 18 mm wide region of oval opacity projecting over the right first anterior rib could be a region of sclerosis in the rib, but it could also be a lung nodule. Routine chest radiographs recommended when feasible. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy. Heart size is normal. Dr. ___ and I discussed the findings and their clinical significance over the telephone at the time of dictation.
