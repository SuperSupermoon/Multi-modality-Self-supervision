A single frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. The lungs are well expanded and clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is upper limits of normal. Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal aside from mild aortic tortuosity. A linear hyperdensity projecting over the left upper quadrant may represent a surgical clip. Healed right posterior rib fractures are noted.
