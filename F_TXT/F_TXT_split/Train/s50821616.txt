AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The patient is now intubated. The ETT is seen to terminate in the trachea 5 cm above the level of the carina. Aortic ___ structures appear unchanged and ___-___ soft tissue prominences have not changed significantly. A new left-sided chest tube has been placed apparently entering in the lower lateral chest wall to reach with its tip in the apical area of the left hemithorax. The basal density has decreased, but quantification is impossible as the patient is in rather steep recumbent position. In general with the ETT in place, the lungs are better aerated and the bases of the diaphragms in lower position. The pulmonary vasculature does not demonstrate any advanced congestive pattern and there is no evidence of new discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates on this single chest view. No pneumothorax identified in the apical area.
