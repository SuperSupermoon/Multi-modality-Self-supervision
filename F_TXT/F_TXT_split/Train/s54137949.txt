In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there may be slight further decrease in the extent of right pleural effusion with the chest tube in place. However, there is again substantial re-expansion edema and atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered. However, there is no right pneumothorax. The left lung is essentially clear. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
