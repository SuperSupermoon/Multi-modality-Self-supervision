New opacification at the base of the right lung is probably a combination of a small pleural effusion and either an unusual distribution of worsened middle lobe atelectasis or pulmonary infarction. If necessary, a lateral view might be helpful to make the distinction. Left lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Central infusion port ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
