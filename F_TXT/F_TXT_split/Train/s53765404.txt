A chest tube overlies the lower right lung. A relatively large pneumothorax is seen at the right lung base. There is increased opacity in the retracted right lung base and perihilar region. The right upper lung appears relatively clear. Probable mild rightward shift of the mediastinum. There is mild cardiomegaly without unfolded aorta. The left hilum is prominent, with a tapered appearance, which could reflect the presence of pulmonary hypertension. There is minimal atelectasis or scarring at the left lung base. There is mi prominence of the interstitial markings in the left lung. Abnormalities in the left lung, which include increased interstitial markings and multiple small nodular opacities, are more completely demonstrated on the outside CT scan.
