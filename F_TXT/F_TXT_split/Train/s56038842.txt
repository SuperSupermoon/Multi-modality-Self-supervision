AP chest compared to ___: Previous study documented clearly that the patient is severely hyperinflated due to emphysema or small airways obstruction. This examination was performed with the patient in relative lordotic posture. It exaggerates the heart size, which may have increased. There is, however, no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or focal pulmonary abnormality. Transvenous right atrial and ventricular pacer leads are in standard positions.
