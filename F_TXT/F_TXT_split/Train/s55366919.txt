Endotracheal tube tip is low lying, terminating 9-mm from the carina. An enteric tube is noted with tip and side port in the stomach. Re- demonstrated is a consolidative opacity in the right lung base which remains concerning for pneumonia. There is likely a small right pleural effusion. Patchy opacity in the left lung base is also noted, slightly more pronounced compared to the previous exam, and could reflect atelectasis or additional area of infection. The remainder of the exam is unchanged. No pneumothorax is seen.
