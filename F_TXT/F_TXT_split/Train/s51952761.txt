Increased poorly delineated fluffy patchy densities in the right lower lung fields in a patient with a history of septic emboli. Location matches the biopsy site from earlier today. Multiple similar-appearing densities throughout lungs are unchanged. Low lung volumes most notable in right likely relates to decreased inspiratory effort given recent procedure. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. The heart size is top normal and mediastinal contour is normal. No bony abnormality.
