Low lung volumes are noted. Right basilar opacity is likely secondary to atelectasis. Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. There is no large effusion or vascular congestion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. A linear radiopaque density with tip overlying the cervical spinal canal may be a spinal stimulator electrode. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
