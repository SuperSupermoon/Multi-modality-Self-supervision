As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube was removed. The pre-existing known parenchymal opacities and scarring at the level of the upper lobes, right more than left, the left lung bases and the right lung bases, are unchanged. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting over the left pleural effusion.
