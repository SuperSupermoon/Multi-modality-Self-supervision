In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. There is still poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm with blunting of the costophrenic angle, consistent with a small effusion and compressive atelectasis. Right lung is essentially clear. Left subclavian catheter extends to the mid to lower portion of the SVC. Tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 4.8 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach, though the tube appears to coil upon itself so that the tip points upward and is in the upper body of the stomach.
