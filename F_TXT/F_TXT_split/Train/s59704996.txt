There is again seen extensive subcutaneous emphysema throughout the neck and right chest however this has improved slightly. Right-sided chest tube is again present. The previously seen right apical pneumothorax is no longer visualized. There has been development of a small right pleural effusion. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. Nodular density within the left upper lobe is consistent with a bony excrescence arising from the first rib, best seen on the prior CT scan.
