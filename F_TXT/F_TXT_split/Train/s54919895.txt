Heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications are seen within the aorta. Hilar contours are normal. The lungs are hyperinflated suggestive of COPD. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles on the frontal view may suggest trace pleural effusions or pleural thickening. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. No pulmonary edema is demonstrated.
