There is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Engorgement of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some increased pulmonary venous pressure. There are bilateral basilar atelectatic changes with probable small effusion on the left. Dilatation of scratch then there is no definite evidence of gastric dilatation.
