Two frontal images of the abdomen demonstrate diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema consistent with CHF. A left base opacity is seen which may represent edema or possibly infection. Tracheal deviation to the left is suggestive of a goiter. This could be verified with a followup thyroid ultrasound. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
