Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. Again seen is left-sided pacemaker, with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle. A small left effusion is present, progressed compared with the prior study. As before, the left hemidiaphragm is tented laterally. Possible mild cardiomegaly, similar to the prior study. There is slight upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. Slight increased retrocardiac density is unchanged and could reflect left lower lobe atelectasis. Otherwise, no focal opacities. No obvious right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is detected.
