CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. A right-sided pacemaker is present, with leads overlying the right atrium and right ventricle. The patient is status post sternotomy, with mediastinal clips. There are low inspiratory volumes. Allowing for this, heart size is borderline or slightly enlarged. There is atelectasis at both lung bases. No gross effusion. Mild vascular plethora may be an artifact of low inspiratory volumes. Rounded density over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen again noted. Compared with ___ at 19:10 p.m., no definite interval change.
