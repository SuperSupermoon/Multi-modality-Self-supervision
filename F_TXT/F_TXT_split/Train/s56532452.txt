1. Slight interval reduction in lung volumes with appearance of patchy bibasilar opacities which likely reflect patchy atelectasis. In addition, there is an interstitial process bilaterally, likely reflecting interval appearance of mild interstitial edema. The heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. Mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning. No pneumothorax. Probable small bilateral effusions.
