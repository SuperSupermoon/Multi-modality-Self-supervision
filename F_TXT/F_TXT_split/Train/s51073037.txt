AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study dated ___. On the AP single view, one can identify the previously described left-sided PICC line seen to terminate overlying the SVC at the level of the carina. Again, an NG tube is seen to reach well below the diaphragm including the side port. Position is not much different from what was seen on the preceding study when NG tube was in appropriate position. The clinical requisition describes a placement of an NG tube which of course is consistent with the made radiographic observation.
