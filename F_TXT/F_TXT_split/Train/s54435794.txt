Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the patient in upright position. A right chest tube has been inserted and loops downward from the apex with its tip projecting in the lower medial thorax. There is no pneumothorax. There is increased opacification at the left lung base, likely due to atelectasis. Multiple lung nodules seen on CT are not well visualized on the radiograph. The heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion.
