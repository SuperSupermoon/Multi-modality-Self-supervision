Exam is limited by patient rotation. Heart size appears mildly enlarged but similar. Aortic knob is densely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable. Lung volumes are low with crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Streaky retrocardiac atelectasis is likely present. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Degenerative changes involving both shoulders are partially imaged.
