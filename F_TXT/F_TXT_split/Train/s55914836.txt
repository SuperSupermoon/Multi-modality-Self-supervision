As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion and constant appearance of the rather extensive left pleural effusion. Moreover, areas of atelectasis caused by the effusion have slightly increased in extent. Massive cardiomegaly persists. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
