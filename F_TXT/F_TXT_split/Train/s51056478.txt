As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Minimal lucent line paralleling the right hemidiaphragm and potentially reflecting a small amount of intra-abdominal air after abdominal surgery. Extensive right basal atelectasis. Low lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No evidence of pneumothorax.
