CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip not optimally seen and only traceable through the level of the lower mediastinum. On these views, it is difficult to confirm that the NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm. Allowing for technical differences, no gross change compared with one day earlier. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for technique. There is upper zone redistribution, diffuse vascular blurring, and bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation, likely with small bilateral effusions. Possibility of associated pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded.
