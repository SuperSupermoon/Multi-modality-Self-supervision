Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm. Apparent interval extubation. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present as well as a worsening confluent opacity in the right infrahilar region, possibly due to developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Worsening opacity in left retrocardiac region could represent progressive atelectasis, aspiration, or additional site of infection. Small pleural effusions are also noted.
