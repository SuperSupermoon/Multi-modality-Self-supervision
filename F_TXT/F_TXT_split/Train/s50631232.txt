There are no major changes compared to prior chest x-ray. The left lung fully opacify for a combination of collapse and pleural fluid. The mediastinal shift towards the opacified lung is increased, likely for more severe collapse. Right lung is still clear, except for parahilar opacity, but without pleural effusion. All the monitoring devices are unchanged. In particular, ET tube ends at 6 cm from carina, NG tube ends below the diaphragm with tip partially visible but likely in the proximal gastric cavity.
