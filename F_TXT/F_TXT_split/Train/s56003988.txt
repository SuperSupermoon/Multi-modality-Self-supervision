The heart is at the upper limits of normal size with a left ventricular configuration. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is new, but mild diffuse interstitial abnormality, which most often would likely signify pulmonary vascular congestion. Left basilar opacity suggests atelectasis or scarring. The aorta is extensively calcified. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is mild rightward convex curvature and bony demineralization with a lower thoracic compression deformity that appears not significantly changed.
