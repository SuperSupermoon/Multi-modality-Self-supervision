Diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has worsened in both lungs, on the left probably due to worsening edema. On the right the large nodular opacities are concerning for concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. The volume of pleural effusion is indeterminate, but not large. Heart size is indeterminate because cardiac borders are obscured but mediastinal widening could be due to venous engorgement. Left upper pigtail pleural drainage catheter is unchanged in position. No pneumothorax.
