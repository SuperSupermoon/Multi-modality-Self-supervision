Small bilateral pleural effusions may have enlarged. Severe consolidation at both lung bases, should be considered pneumonia into approved otherwise. Pulmonary vascularity is normal, heart size is normal, and mild mediastinal venous engorgement suggest a increased intravascular volume, but not heart failure, and therefore the appearance of the lower lungs cannot be attributed to dependent edema.
