Moderate right apical pneumothorax has slightly increased in size, with two pleural catheters remaining in place. The basilar hydropneumothorax component is probably unchanged, but difficult to assess due to differences in patient positioning. Otherwise, no relevant changes in the appearance of the chest since the previous study of earlier today.
