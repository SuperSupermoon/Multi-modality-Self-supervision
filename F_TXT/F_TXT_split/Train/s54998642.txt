The right lung is grossly clear. Streaky left midlung opacity could be due to atelectasis. Cardiac enlargement is likely accentuated by technique. Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch. S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis is seen. Left lateral eighth and ninth rib fractures may be chronic.
