As compared to the prior radiograph from 1 day earlier, there has not been a substantial change in the appearance of the chest. A small poorly defined nodular opacity lateral to the left hilum is unchanged considering positional differences between the exams. When the patient's condition allows, standard PA and lateral views of the chest would be helpful for further characterization.
