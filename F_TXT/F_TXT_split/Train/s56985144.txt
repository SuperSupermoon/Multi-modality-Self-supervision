AP portable upright view of the chest. An endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates within the stomach, with the side hole just below the diaphragm. There is a new right basilar opacity, likely reflecting a combination of a new moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis. The heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax or left pleural effusion.
