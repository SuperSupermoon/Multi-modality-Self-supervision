The endotracheal tube is 5 cm above the carina. There is dense retrocardiac opacity compatible volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. Left upper lung is slightly better aerated than on the prior exam. There continues to be some volume loss/infiltrate in the right lower lung with some minimal obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm. The remainder of the appearance of the chest is unchanged compared to prior.
