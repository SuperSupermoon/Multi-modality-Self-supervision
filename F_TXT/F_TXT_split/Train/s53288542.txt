In comparison with the study of ___, of the endotracheal tube has been pulled back, so that the tip lies approximately 6 cm above the carina. The patient has taken a much better inspiration. Nasogastric tube coils in the fundus and then extends to at least the lower body of the stomach. There is poor definition of a small portion of the left hemidiaphragm. This suggests small layering effusion with compressive atelectasis at the base. No evidence of vascular congestion.
