Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 5.6 cm above the carina, and right subclavian vascular catheter terminates just below the expected junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium. Stable appearance of cardiomediastinal contours. Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion. New patchy right lower lobe opacity is likely atelectasis, but aspiration and early focus of pneumonia could have a similar radiographic appearance. Slight worsening of patchy and linear opacity at left base is also likely due to atelectasis. No visible pneumothorax.
