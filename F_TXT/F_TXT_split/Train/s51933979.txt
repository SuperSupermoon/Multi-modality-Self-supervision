A left pectoral single lead pacemaker partially obscures the left mid lung. The chin and associated soft tissues partially obscures the lung apices. Suboptimal aeration of the left lower lobe may be due to overlaying soft tissue, but there may be a component of atelectasis or aspiration. The right lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax. The bones are diffusely osteopenic. Dense vascular calcifications are incidentally noted.
