The left IJ line projects slightly more distal, near the cavoatrial junction. Lines and tubes are otherwise grossly unchanged. No pneumothorax detected. Again seen are extensive patchy opacities in both lungs, most pronounced in the right upper and mid zones but also seen at the right and left bases and left perihilar region. The overall distribution is similar. Changes in the right upper and suprahilar zones may be slightly less dense. No gross effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged. Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is again noted.
