Interval placement of nasogastric tube within the proximal stomach, but side port likely above the GE junction level. Other devices are unchanged in position, including a left chest tube and endotracheal tube. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Rounded opacity in left upper lobe appears similar to the prior study, and likely corresponds to a known lung mass on recent PET-CT. Poorly defined opacities in the left upper lobe centrally may reflect atelectasis adjacent to the site of recent lymph node biopsy. Conglomerate lymph nodes in the aorticopulmonary window and left hilar region appear similar. Decreased extent of left hemidiaphragm elevation, with some residual patchy atelectasis remaining in the left retrocardiac region. Decreased small right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion. No visible pneumothorax.
