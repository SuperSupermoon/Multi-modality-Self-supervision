A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and right hemidiaphragm elevation. There is an unexplained left basal abnormality, which may represent atelectasis, but is not well evaluated. There is probably no pneumonia, but conventional frontal and lateral chest radiographs would be very helpful in further evaluation. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
