Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. Tubes and lines are in unchanged position. Right chest tube is in place. Left midline tip terminates at the level of left axilla. Bilateral effusions are demonstrated, but there is interval progression of the right lower lung opacities that might be consistent with interval development of atelectasis or aspiration. No interval development of pneumothorax is demonstrated.
