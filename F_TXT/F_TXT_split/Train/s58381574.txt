Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance. Lungs are essentially clear and there is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Of note is the left perihilar opacity that was not well seen on the prior study and potentially might represent pulmonary nodule, 2.6 x 1 cm in diameter. Correlation with chest CT is required.
