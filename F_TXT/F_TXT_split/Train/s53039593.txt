The lung volumes are low. There has been an interval slight increase in opacification in the right lower lobe compared to the prior study. No other new focal consolidations are seen. There is evidence of slight bilateral vascular engorgement, without evidence of frank interstitial edema. Areas of atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions as well as minimal blunting of the left constphrenic sinus persist in an unchanged manner. There is stable moderate cardiomegaly. There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath and a right-sided PICC line which terminates in the superior SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
