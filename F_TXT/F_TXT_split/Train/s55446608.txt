The lung volumes are low. There is an increasing pleural effusion on the left, although difficult to quantify, with patchy associated opacity, likely compatible with atelectasis. There is a newly apparent small pleural effusion on the right, again with patchy opacity probably due to atelectasis. A vague new left perihilar opacity may be due to a symmetric form of vascular edema, but other causes such as an infection are differential considerations based on the imaging. The bones are probably demineralized.
