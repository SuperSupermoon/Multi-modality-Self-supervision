There is severe bilateral alveolar pulmonary edema, which is worse than on the most prior study from approximately 24 hours ago. As a result, new central air bronchograms are apparent. A right-sided central catheter is in unchanged position, terminating approximately at the cavoatrial junction. Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are difficult to evaluate due to overlying edema.
