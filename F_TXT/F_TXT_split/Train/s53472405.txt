Endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet, approximately 12 cm above the level of the chronic, and should be advanced. A nasogastric tube courses inferior to the diaphragm and terminates within the left upper quadrant. Mediastinal clips are noted. The lung themselves are well expanded and grossly clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable in appearance.
