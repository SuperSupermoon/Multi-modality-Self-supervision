Underlying trauma board and the external artifact partially obscure the view. The right lower lateral hemithorax is not fully included on the image. Given this, what appears to be an endotracheal tube is high in position, terminating approximately 7.9 cm above the level of the carina and above the level of the clavicles. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No displaced fracture is seen.
