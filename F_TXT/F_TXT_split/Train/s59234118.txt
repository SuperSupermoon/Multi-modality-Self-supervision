Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an ET tube tip located 2.9 cm from the level of the carina. A right IJ central venous catheter tip remains approximately 3 cm beyond the cavoatrial junction and should be pulled back by approximately 3 cm. An enteric tube is in position. The heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Multifocal bilateral parenchymal opacity little changed with probable superimposed pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
