Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior study. There is improved aeration of the right lung after bronchoscopy. A known moderate right hydropneumothorax is visualized at the right lung apex; however, it has decreased. Interstitial opacities in the left lung are unchanged and likely represent mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. No left-sided pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Again, post-surgical changes are noted including scattered clips in the right upper hemithorax, surgical ___ along the right lateral hemithorax, median sternotomy wires that are aligned and intact, and several right rib defects as well as defects within medial portion of the right clavcle.
