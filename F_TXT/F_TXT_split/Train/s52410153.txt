Again seen is the small to moderate pneumothorax surrounding the right upper lobe, overall similar in configuration to the prior study. The densely opacified rind of right lung apex is now better aerated. Again seen are intra bronchial valves, right mid lung chain sutures, and a right-sided chest tube. Also again seen is the right perihilar opacity and triangular right infrahilar opacity as well as blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Background parenchymal and bullous changes noted. The mediastinum were remains relatively midline. On the left, the appearance is overall similar, with extensive apical bullous change and parenchymal opacities and probable slight superior hilar retraction. There is a focal irregular opacity measuring approximately ___ x 28 mm. Although this was less apparent on the prior CXR, it has a corresponding abnormality on the ___ chest CT. There is slight blunting of left costophrenic angle which appears new. Minimal atelectasis/ scarring at the left lung base and no gross left pleural effusion.
