Endotracheal tube is seen approximately 7 cm above the carina in this projection. A left-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC. A right pigtail catheter remains in place at the base of the right lung. Again seen are bilateral airspace opacities consistent with pulmonary edema, which has improved from the prior study. The right-sided pulmonary effusion is decreased in size from the prior exam. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are grossly unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
