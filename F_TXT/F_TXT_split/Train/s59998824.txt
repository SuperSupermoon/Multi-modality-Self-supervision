Improvement in generalized level of radiodensity in the lungs over 24 hr is presumably due to improvement in the component that is due to recover verbal pulmonary edema, but the severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, probably largely pulmonary fibrosis, is of course unchanged. Pleural effusions small if any. No pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube midline. Right PIC line ends in the mid to low SVC.
