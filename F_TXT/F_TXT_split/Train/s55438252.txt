Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta appearing similar. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflects atelectasis without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Marked degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint are again noted with osteophyte formation. 2 rounded calcific densities projecting over the right scapula may reflect loose bodies, unchanged from the previous chest radiograph.
