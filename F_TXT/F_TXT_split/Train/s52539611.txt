1. Right subclavian PICC line, feeding tube and endotracheal tube appear unchanged in position. Lung volumes are slightly lower on the current examination. Persistent heterogeneous opacity at the right lung base has likely not significantly changed, but may reflect an area of aspiration or early infection. Followup imaging may be helpful. There is persistent retrocardiac opacity as well, which could reflect an area of atelectasis or additional site of aspiration/pneumonia. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
