A moderate to large left pleural effusion is present. No definite pneumothorax is identified. Left basilar opacification may reflect compressive atelectasis though infection or contusion is difficult to exclude. The right lung appears grossly clear. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Heart size is difficult to determine given the presence of the left basilar opacification and pleural effusion. Calcification of the aortic knob is visualized. Displaced fractures of multiple left-sided posterior ribs are noted, likely the left ___, ___, and 10th ribs.
