Left lower lobe collapse developed between ___ and ___ accompanied by small left pleural effusion. On ___ there was new consolidation in the left lower lung laterally, either in the upper lobe or aerated lower lobe, probably pneumonia or aspiration leading to pneumonia, also responsible for the large scale consolidation that developed in the right lower lobe concurrent with increased intravascular volume today later, on ___. Pulmonary edema developed on ___, perhaps with worsening pneumonia. Read in conjunction with the chest radiograph taken earlier today, the combination of bilateral lower lobe pneumonia and moderately severe pulmonary edema is the most likely explanation for developments over the past several days. Edema has worsened since earlier in the day and there is probably a moderate volume of pleural fluid on the left, small amount on the right. Heart is normal size, but mediastinal veins are still distended. Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. There is no pneumothorax. Avascular per stent has been inserted in the right neck.
