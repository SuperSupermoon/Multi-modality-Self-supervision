There is a mildly tortuous thoracic aorta. Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are normal. The bilateral hila are normal. Projecting over the left upper lung, there is a 5 mm circular possibly calcified opacity, which may represent bony island or left upper lobe lung nodule, possibly an old calcified granuloma ; specific localization is limited given lack of alternative views. It is recommended to obtain any old chest x-rays if this is not a known finding, or to obtain apical lordotic views if there are no prior films. Otherwise, there are no focal lung consolidations. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax or effusion.
