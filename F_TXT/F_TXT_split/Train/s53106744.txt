No focal consolidation is seen. There is slight blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles which could be due to trace pleural effusions. Possible mild central point vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Several chronic appearing mid to lower lateral right rib deformities are noted, possibly sequela of prior trauma.
