Triple-lead left-sided AICD is again seen, unchanged in position, with leads extending in the expected positions of the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains stably enlarged. Again, there is mild indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels, raising the possibility of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No definite focal consolidation.
