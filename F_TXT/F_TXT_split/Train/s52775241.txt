As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. There is minimally improved ventilation of the previously opacified left lung apices. However, a large, predominantly atelectatic consolidation at the left lung base persists. There is unchanged leftward shift of the mediastinum and the heart. The right lung appears normal and unchanged. No evidence of right-sided pneumonia.
