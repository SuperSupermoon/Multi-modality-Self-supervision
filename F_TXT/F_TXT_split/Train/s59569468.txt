Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes. There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, which could be due to atelectasis, which may be due to atelectasis and low lung volumes. There is a subtle lucency along the expected location of the left hemidiaphragm and free intraabdominal air is not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen, although trace left pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by AP, portable technique and low lung volumes. No pneumothorax is seen. No pulmonary edema seen.
