The patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates in the right mainstem bronchus. An orogastric tube passes into the stomach. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar. Better demonstrated is a persistent retrocardiac consolidation with air bronchograms in the left lower lobe. The right lung base appears less opacified than before, arguing against an addition focus of pneumonia in this area, although there is a persistent suspected pleural effusion based on veil-like layering. Moderate pulmonary edema appears similar.
