Prominence of right paratracheal soft tissues likely reflects vascular structures in someone of this age. There is upper zone redistribution and possible mild vascular plethora. There is bibasilar atelectasis, overall similar to ___. No frank consolidation is identified. No gross effusion. Incidental note is made of a partially imaged right shoulder reverse total prosthesis and severe left glenohumeral osteoarthritis, with findings suggestive of chronic left rotator cuff tear.
