Single portable frontal image of the chest. The lung volumes are low. There has been interval development of a linear opacity in the left mid lung which likely represents subsegmental atelectasis, probably in the lingula. A calcified granuloma is seen in the medial right lung base. Opacity is seen in the medial right lung base, which may refelect a combination of atelectasis and overlapping vascular structures. There is patchy atelectasis at the left lung base. There is a small right pleural effusion. A feeding tube is noted in adequate position in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable from prior exam.
