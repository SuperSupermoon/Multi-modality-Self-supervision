AP chest compared to ___:39 p.m. Upper enteric drainage tube has been repositioned, ending in the low portion of a non-distended stomach. Bibasilar atelectasis has improved substantially, moderately severe on both sides. Borderline interstitial edema has also improved. Pleural effusions are small if any. Cardiomegaly is probably not severe: With the chin down, tip of the endotracheal tube slightly more than 2 cm from the carina is acceptable, but could be withdrawn 1 cm to avoid unilateral intubation should the flexion of the neck and mandible increase. Right PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
