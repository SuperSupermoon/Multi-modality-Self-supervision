As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. All monitoring and support devices are constant, except for the endotracheal tube that has been minimally advanced and now projects approximately 2.7 cm above the carina. No safe evidence of pneumothorax on the current image, but extensive soft tissue air collection in the left and right cervical regions is seen. Slightly increasing areas of right basal atelectasis. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
