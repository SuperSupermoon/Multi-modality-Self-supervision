Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.5 cm above the level of the carina. NG tube is seen extending into the left hemithorax, raising concern for endobronchial intubation versus less likely large hiatal hernia. The side port is seen projecting over the left mid-to-lower hemithorax. This was discussed with ___ at 5:40 p.m. on ___, three minutes after discovery. There are bibasilar opacities, which may be due to aspiration and/or infection. There is left base atelectasis and small left pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette top normal to mildly enlarged, and the aorta is unfolded. If there is concern for aortic process, consider chest CTA.
