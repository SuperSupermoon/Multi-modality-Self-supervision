A right subclavian line ends at lower SVC, right chest tube with its tip near the right lung apex are unchanged in position. Heterogeneous opacification of the lung parenchyma is persistent since ___, but unchanged since ___. Contribution from atelectasis or pneumonia cannot be certainly defined. Moreover, in the background of emphysema determination of each components is further limited. Bibasal atelectasis left side more than right and presumably mild bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Mild-to-moderate-sized heart, mediastinal and hilar contours have similar appearance.
