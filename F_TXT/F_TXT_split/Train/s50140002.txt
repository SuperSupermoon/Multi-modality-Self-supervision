AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study dated ___. The present AP single view obtained with patient in semi-upright position demonstrates increasing basal density with increased blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses. Previously described pleural density along the entire right chest wall remains unchanged and the same holds for the previously described two right basal draining pleural tubes. Observed is that also the left pleural sinus shows now some fluid blunting its contours. No pneumothorax is present.
