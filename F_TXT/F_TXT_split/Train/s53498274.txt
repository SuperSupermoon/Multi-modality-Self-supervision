1. Patchy right basilar opacity, typical for atelectasis. If pulmonary symptoms or present or persist, howver, short-term followup radiographs could be considered to re-evaluate the opacity, preferably with PA and lateral technique, if possible clinically. 2. Nodular focus projecting over the left lung apex, near an EKG lead. Although likely an artifact, it is difficult to exclude a true pulmonary nodule, and accordingly re-assessment with standard PA and lateral radiographs is recommended, following removal of the EKG leads, when clinically appropriate.
