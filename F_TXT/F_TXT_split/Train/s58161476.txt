Again demonstrated is extensive subcutaneous emphysema, more so within the left chest wall and neck compared to the right, as well as pneumomediastinum and a moderate size left basal lateral hydropneumothorax, all of which appear similar in size and extent compared with the most recent prior chest radiograph with the exception of the pneumomediastinum which appears improved. Heart size remains within normal limits. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with similar slight rightward shift of the mediastinal structures. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Chain sutures are seen within the left perihilar region compatible with history of prior wedge resection. Lungs are hyperinflated with marked emphysematous changes re- demonstrated. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are more pronounced in the interval, and may reflect aspiration or infection. Scarring in the right hilus is unchanged. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
