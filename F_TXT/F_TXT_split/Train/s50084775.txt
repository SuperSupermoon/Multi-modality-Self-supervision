A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest wall pacer device with leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle, and endotracheal tube terminating in the mid to upper thoracic trachea, approximately 6.5 cm from the carina, and an enteric tube terminating in the stomach. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits and the lungs are well expanded without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Widened right AC joint is compatible with grade 3 injury, of unclear chronicity.
