Single frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a newly placed left pigtail catheter which crosses the left lung transversely. There has been interval improvement in the left-sided pneumothorax with residual apical pneumothorax still seen. There is partial reinflation of the left lower lobe compared to the prior radiograph. There is unchanged appearance of the right lung with still small extrapleural hematoma as well as mild right-sided pleural effusion.
