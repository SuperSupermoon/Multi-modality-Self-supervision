Tracheostomy is unchanged position. A right pigtail catheter overlies the right hemi thorax in largely unchanged position. A right-sided PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes are slightly low. Bilateral airspace opacities are again demonstrated and not significantly changed from the prior examination. Obscuration of the left costophrenic angle is increased from the prior examination consistent with a small to moderate left layering left pleural effusion. Small right loculated effusion is stable. Retrocardiac opacity may represent some areas of atelectasis or consolidation. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
