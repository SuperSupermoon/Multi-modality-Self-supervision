Lung volumes remain exceedingly low making it difficult to distinguish bibasilar atelectasis from pneumonia, but the process is much more severe on the left than the right, and accompanied there by at least a small pleural effusion. Low lung volumes exaggerate mild cardiomegaly. There is no pulmonary edema. Feeding tube passes into the stomach and a view. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC. Transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead unchanged in standard position. No pneumothorax.
