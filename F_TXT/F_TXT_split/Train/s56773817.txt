As compared to previous study of 1 day earlier, the patient has been intubated, with tip of tube abutting the lower right lateral wall of the trachea approximately 1.3 cm above the carina. Withdrawal by a few cm is suggested for optimal positioning. Exam is otherwise remarkable for a very large hiatal hernia, adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation, and a moderate layering left pleural effusion. New right upper lobe opacities could reflect aspiration or evolving pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Previously present free intraperitoneal air is less apparent, probably are due to supine positioning.
