The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiovascular surgery. Sternal wires are absent. Cardiac silhouette is stable in the post-operative period, but mediastinal width has slightly decreased, with associated slight improvement in extent of pulmonary edema, now moderate in severity. Bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with no definite pneumothorax. Prominent lucency adjacent to left cardiac silhouette contour may reflect post-operative pneumopericardium, less likely a medial left pneumothorax. Attention to this region on short-term followup radiograph would be helpful.
