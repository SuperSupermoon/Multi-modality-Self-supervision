Marked cardiomegaly is again demonstrated with particular prominence of the right cardiac chambers. Main pulmonary artery is enlarged, suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Interval worsening of pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by interstitial pulmonary edema. Moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion have also slightly increased in the interval. Dense opacity in the right retrocardiac region could be due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, but infectious consolidation in this region is also possible.
