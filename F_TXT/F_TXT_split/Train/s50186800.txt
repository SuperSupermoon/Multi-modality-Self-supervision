There is new mild central pulmonary vascular prominence but no overt edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The heart size is top-normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours remain within normal limits. No focal consolidation is seen. Linear opacities at the lung bases are most compatible with atelectasis.
