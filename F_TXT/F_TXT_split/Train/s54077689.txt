AP chest compared to ___: The inferior two-thirds of the left hemithorax is opacified, probably by a combination of pleural effusion, moderate-to-large, and large scale consolidation in the left lung. Whether this is pneumonia or only atelectasis is radiographically indeterminate. Small right pleural effusion is new. Heart is moderately-to-severely enlarged, but heart size cannot be assessed because heart borders are obscured by pleural and parenchymal abnormalities. Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified and tortuous, but not focally aneurysmal. Dr. ___ was paged to report these findings at the time of dictation. No pneumothorax.
