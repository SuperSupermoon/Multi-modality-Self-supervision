Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates the right internal jugular central venous catheter in unchanged position in the low SVC. The patient has been extubated and the NG tube has been removed. Lung volumes are lower with stable cardiomegaly. Mild pulmonary edema is worsened. A retrocardiac opacity likely reflects a combination of atelectasis and effusion; although, an underlying infection or aspiration is possible. Right basilar atelectasis is present. No pneumothorax.
