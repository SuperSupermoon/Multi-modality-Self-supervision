Since the prior exam, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been slightly withdrawn, but it still ends in the proximal left pulmonary artery. The patient has had recent sternotomy with aortic valve replacement. Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. The side port of the enteric tube sits at the GE junction. Advancement by at least 5 cm should be considered for more optimal positioning within the stomach. Remaining support devices, including an ET tube and mediastinal drain remain in satisfactory position. The lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged.
