Following placement of right chest tube to waterseal, a tiny right apicolateral pneumothorax is unchanged. Post-operative widening of the mediastinum is stable in appearance in this patient status post esophagectomy procedure. Bibasilar atelectasis is again demonstrated, slightly worse in the left lower lobe in the interval. Small pleural effusions are not appreciably changed.
