Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. Again seen is bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right, which is not significantly changed from the prior study. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. The left-sided PICC line ends at the distal SVC. The nasogastric tube is coiled in the stomach. There is persistent distension of multiple loops of bowel.
