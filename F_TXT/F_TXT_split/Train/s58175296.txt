Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study. Previous median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass graft clips noted. Even allowing for the projection, the heart is moderately to severely enlarged. Haziness of pulmonary vasculature is consistent with congestive heart failure. The extent of airspace opacities slightly decreased when compared to the prior study consistent with slight interval improvement in the known pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
