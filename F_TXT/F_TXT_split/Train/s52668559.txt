1. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable overall cardiac and mediastinal contours given lordotic technique on the current examination. There is an increasing patchy opacity at the right medial lung base, which could reflect worsening atelectasis or an evolving aspiration/pneumonia. In addition, there is a layering left effusion versus chronic pleural thickening. A 5-mm calcified nodule in the left mid lung is stable, consistent with a calcified granuloma. No evidence of overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen.
