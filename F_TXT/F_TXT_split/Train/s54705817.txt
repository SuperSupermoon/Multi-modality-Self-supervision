AP chest compared to ___: Diameter of the cardiac silhouette is now enlarged, and mediastinal veins are engorged. Findings could be due to cardiomegaly and right heart failure and/or volume overload or alternatively pericardial effusion. Heterogeneous opacification in the left lung could be either asymmetric edema, worse in the left lung, or recent aspiration. Small pleural effusions are presumed but not large. No pneumothorax. Tip of the endotracheal tube is less than 15 mm from the carina, 2.5 cm below appropriate positioning. Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Findings discussed after interpretation of a subsequent chest radiograph available at the time of this review.
