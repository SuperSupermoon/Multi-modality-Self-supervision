As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right-sided pigtail catheter in the pleural space. The catheter is in correct position. The appearance of the lung parenchyma, both on the right and on the left, however, are unchanged. Notably, the extent of the known small right pleural effusion is constant. The extensive parenchymal opacities are unchanged in extent and distribution.
