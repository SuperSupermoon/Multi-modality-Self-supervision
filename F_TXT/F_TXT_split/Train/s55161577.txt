Lung volumes are lower today but they are more clear today than on ___. The reason I am referring to the ___ chest radiograph Is because the chest CT on ___ clarified the diffuse pulmonary abnormality as mild edema and bibasilar micronodular abnormality and bronchiectasis. The large opacity in the left lung at the level of the aortic arch was due to fissural pleural fluid and it has decreased. Moderate cardiomegaly is the same or improved. Left pleural calcification is noted. The improvement therefore is probably due to resolving pulmonary edema, however the lungs are not as clear today as they were on ___. Tip of the ET tube at the thoracic inlet is no less than 7 cm from the carina an should be advanced 3 cm for more secure positioning. Dual channel left jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC. Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC. Esophageal drainage tube coils in the stomach and passes out of view. No pneumothorax.
