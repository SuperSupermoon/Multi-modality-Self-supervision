Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a trauma board overlying the thorax limiting underlying assessment. The ET tube extends to 4.6 cm above the carina. An enteric tube extends inferiorly out of view with side port below the GE junction, likely within the stomach. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is upper lobe predominant left lung consolidation likely representing a combination of aspiration and pulmonary contusion. There is no evidence to suggest pneumothorax. Multiple bilateral rib fractures are better correlated with subsequent CT.
