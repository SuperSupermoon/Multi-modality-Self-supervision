Comparison is made with prior study performed eight hours earlier. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Bibasilar opacities have markedly worsened larger on the right side, a combination of increasing pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis. Mild vascular congestion is stable. There is no evident pneumothorax.
