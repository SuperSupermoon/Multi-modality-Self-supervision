There is probable hyperinflation with background COPD. There are diffusely increased interstitial markings, with more pronounced bibasilar opacities, which may represent atelectasis or aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting. No substantial pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged. Aorta is calcified and slightly unfolded. No acute osseous abnormalities identified. Severe right glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis noted. Rounded lucency projecting over the left cardiophrenic region raises the possibility of a small hiatal hernia.
