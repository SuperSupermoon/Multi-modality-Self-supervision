Free intraperitoneal air below the right hemidiaphragm is likely due to provided history of recent abdominal surgery. Marked leftward patient rotation limits evaluation of cardiomediastinal contours. Moderate to large left pleural effusion is accompanied by adjacent left lower lobe collapse. Right lung is clear except for minor linear atelectasis of the right lung base and a small adjacent pleural effusion. Repeat nonrotated radiograph would be helpful for more complete assessment of the chest when the patient's condition permits.
