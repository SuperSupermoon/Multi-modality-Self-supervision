In comparison with the study ___ ___, there again is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in this patient with intact midline sternal wires following previous CABG procedure. Indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Right basilar opacification is unchanged. Although this could merely represent a combination of vascular congestion and atelectatic changes, in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude, especially in the absence of a lateral view. Opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the lower lobe.
