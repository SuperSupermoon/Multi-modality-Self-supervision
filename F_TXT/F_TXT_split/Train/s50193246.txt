In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette appears further enlarged, some of which may represent the supine AP rather than upright PA study previously. There is also a increased elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Hilar and mediastinal prominence is again consistent with lymphadenopathy. Following mediastinal biopsy, there is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
