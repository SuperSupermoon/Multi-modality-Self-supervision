The ET tube tip lies at the level of the mid clavicular heads. The carina is not well delineated, but the tip of the ET tube likely lies approximately 4.7 cm above the carina. An NG type tube is present, tip overlying the stomach. No NG sideport is identified. If present, the NG tube sideport may be obscured by a spine hardware. If so, it lies in the region of the GE junction, probably slightly proximal to the GE junction. No pneumothorax is detected. Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There has been slight interval improvement in degree of retrocardiac opacity, consistent with interval improvement in left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is noted. New no new focal opacity or area of consolidation is identified. No gross right or left pleural effusion is seen. Small effusions could still be present. Mild vascular plethora likely relates to supine positioning. Doubt overt CHF. Spinal fixation hardware noted. An ovoid locule of air in the right cardiophrenic region is unchanged compared with the preoperative chest x-ray from ___ this likely represents artifact due to suture material from prior lung surgery.
