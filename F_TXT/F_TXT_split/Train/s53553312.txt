The patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube closely approaches the carinal within about 1 cm. An orogastric tube passes into the stomach on and terminates there. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. The lung volumes are decreased with patchy left basilar opacity which is probably due to atelectasis.
