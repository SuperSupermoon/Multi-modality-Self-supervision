Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to the prior study obtained on ___. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The ET tube tip is too low, approaching 1.7 cm above the carina and should be pulled back for about 1.5 cm. Right central venous line tip terminates at the level of cavoatrial junction, proximal right atrium. Left retrocardiac opacity most likely representing consolidation and pleural effusion is unchanged. The rest of the lungs are essentially clear.
