The smaller right basilar chest tube has been removed and a single chest tube remains in place. There is stable appearance to the right hemithorax with a diffuse parenchymal and pleural abnormality, some of which is attributable to radiation fibrosis. There may be a tiny stable right apical pneumothorax, although it is less well seen on the current study. Residual subcutaneous emphysema within the right lateral chest wall. Stable patchy left basilar opacity with increasing pleural effusion suggestive of atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Heart remains within normal limits in size.
