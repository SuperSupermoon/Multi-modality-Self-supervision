Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There has been an interval increase in the degree of retrocardiac opacity, which may represent developing pneumonia. Right basalar atelectasis is not significantly changed. There is no pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion. Endotracheal tube is less than 2 cm from the carina. A right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the mid SVC. The nasogastric tube ends in the stomach with the last sideport above the GE junction.
