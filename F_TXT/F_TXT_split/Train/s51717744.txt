Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There has been removal of the endotracheal tube. There is a right IJ central line with distal lead tip in the right cavoatrial junction. Heart size is enlarged but stable. There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities, particularly at lung bases as well as bilateral pleural effusions. Findings are consistent with pulmonary edema. Consolidation at the bases is not excluded. Overall, these findings are unchanged from the prior study.
