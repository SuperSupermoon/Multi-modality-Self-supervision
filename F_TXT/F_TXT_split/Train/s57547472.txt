There continues to be a stable diffuse airspace process within the left lung and to a lesser extent in the right lower lung. Findings may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema in this patient status post right upper lobectomy, although pneumonia should also be considered. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient positioning. Endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Minimal residual right lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema. No pneumothorax appreciated.
