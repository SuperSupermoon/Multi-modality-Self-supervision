AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Lungs are essentially clear. No focal consolidation, pneumothorax or increase in pleural effusion is demonstrated. Fullness in the right hilus is noted and repeat radiograph with better inspiratory effort is suggested for precise characterization.
