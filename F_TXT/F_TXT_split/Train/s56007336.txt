As compared to the recent study, a tracheostomy tube has been placed, terminating within the trachea approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. Cuff of the tube may be slightly over distended. Lung volumes are improved compared to the prior study, with associated improving basilar atelectasis, with minimal residual linear left basilar atelectasis remaining. Otherwise, no relevant changes since recent study.
