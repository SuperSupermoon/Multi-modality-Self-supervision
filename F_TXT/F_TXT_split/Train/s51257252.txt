A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a right internal jugular central catheter, with the tip terminating in the distal SVC/cavoatrial junction. Bibasilar opacities are more prominent compared to the chest radiograph in the day prior, likely related to slightly decreased lung volumes. Increased opacity projecting over the left heart border may represent lingular consolidation, possibly suggesting aspiration.
