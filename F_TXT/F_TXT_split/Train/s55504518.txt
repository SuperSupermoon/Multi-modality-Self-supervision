An ET tube ends 3.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is seen extending below the diaphragm, overlying the expected location of the stomach. The NG tube sideport if present, also likely overlies the the stomach. Lung volumes are low. There is increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. A small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. Probable minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region. The right lung is otherwise clear. No gross right effusion. Prominence of the upper zone vessels is likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. Note is made of a stent or other tubing overlying the right abdomen. Right upper quadrant surgical clips are also present.
