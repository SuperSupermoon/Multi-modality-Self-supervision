Comparison to ___. The patient has received a right-sided PICC line. The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the mid SVC. No complications, notably no pneumothorax. A new parenchymal opacity is seen at the lateral aspect of the right upper lobe basis. The opacity could reflect pneumonia. Re evaluation with a frontal and lateral radiograph. Within 12 hr as well as correlation with the clinical presentation should be performed. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Mild elongation of the descending aorta.
