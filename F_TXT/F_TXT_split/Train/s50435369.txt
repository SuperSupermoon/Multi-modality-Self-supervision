Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates stable right transjugular central venous catheter with tip in the mid SVC. There has been interval extubation and removal of chest tubes, with a tiny right apical pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for postoperative status. Median sternotomy wires are unchanged. There has been prior coronary artery bypass grafting. The lung volumes are significantly decreased since 2 days ago, with increased bibasilar dependent atelectasis and new small pleural effusions, greater on the left.
