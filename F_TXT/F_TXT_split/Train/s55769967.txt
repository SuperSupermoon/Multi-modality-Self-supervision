Endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating 5.4 cm from the carina. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. Aorta is tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob. There is mild cephalization of pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Hazy and patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis with small right pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified. No displaced rib fractures are visualized.
