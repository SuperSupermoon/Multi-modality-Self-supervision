In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size. There is probable mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the right base is consistent with small layering effusion and compressive atelectasis. Similar appearance at the left base is consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Monitoring and support devices are unchanged. No definite acute focal pneumonia. However, in view of the multiple pulmonary changes, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
