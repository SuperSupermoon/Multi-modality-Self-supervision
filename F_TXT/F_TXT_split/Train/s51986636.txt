AP chest compared to ___: Patient has been extubated, and both the pulmonary flotation catheter and intra-aortic pump balloon have been removed. Chronicity of severe constriction and probable atelectasis of the left lung is uncertain. Right lung is intrinsically emphysematous but also overexpanded in compensation. There is some atelectasis at the right base as well. Any prior imaging should be obtained to establish the chronicity of these findings. Failing that, bronchoscopy should be considered to evaluate the airway to the left lung. Heart size is normal.
