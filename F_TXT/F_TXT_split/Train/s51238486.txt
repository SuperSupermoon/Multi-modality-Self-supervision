As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously malpositioned catheter has been pulled back. The tip of the catheter now projects 3 cm above the carina. There is no evidence of complications, no pneumothorax. Mild atelectasis at the left lung bases, potentially combined to a minimal left pleural effusion.
