Comparison is made to previous study from ___. Intra-aortic balloon pump, endotracheal tube, and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. Again, the side port of the nasogastric tube is at the GE junction and this could be advanced 10 cm for more optimal placement. There are unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions and a left retrocardiac opacity.
