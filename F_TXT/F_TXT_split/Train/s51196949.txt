Patient is status post open cardiac surgery with stent graft placement for repair of an aortic pseudoaneurysm. Stent graft and prosthetic aortic valve are in expected position. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Endotracheal tube and nasoenteric catheter are in expected positions. Bilateral chest tubes are noted. After interval readjustment of the right chest tube, there has been significant decrease in the size of the right pneumothorax, though a small amount of right pleural air persists. Overall aeration of the right lung is similar to prior radiograph from ___ at 4:54 a.m. with persistent right basilar consolidation. Aeration of the left lung is unchanged and relatively clear. There is no large pleural effusion. No new edema is identified. Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal contours is unchanged and consistent with recent postoperative state.
