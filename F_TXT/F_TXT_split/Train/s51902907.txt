Upright frontal chest/abdominal radiograph demonstrates a Dobbhoff tube ending in the left upper quadrant. The curvature of the Dobbhoff tube suggests that it is within the fourth portion of the duodenum. There is a right central venous catheter line ending in the right atrium. The bowel gas pattern is unremarkable. There is retrocardiac opacity in the left lung base, perhaps in large part an effusion.
