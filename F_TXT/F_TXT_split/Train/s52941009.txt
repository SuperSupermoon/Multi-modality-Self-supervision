Since ___, pulmonary vascular congestion is new, and accompanied by mild cardiomegaly. Minimal perihilar haziness on the right may reflect asymmetrical edema. Left costophrenic sulcus remains blunted, but a prior lateral radiograph demonstrated no evidence of pleural effusion. Fullness of right hilar region may be due to engorged vessels in the setting of pulmonary vascular congestion, but followup PA and lateral chest radiographs prior to discharge would be helpful to better evaluate the hilar structures and to exclude the possibility of a mass.
