Comparison is made with prior study from ___. Tracheostomy and left-sided central line are unchanged in position. There is again seen bilateral pleural effusion, right side worse than left. The right-sided effusion appears partially loculated around the right lateral chest wall. There is a left retrocardiac opacity. There are no signs for pneumothoraces. Overall, these appear stable allowing for differences in patient positioning. There is again seen a healing rib fracture involving the left eighth lateral rib.
