Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema has improved, if not cleared, since ___ but small bilateral pleural effusions have increased, and severe left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation which developed on ___ has not improved. No pneumothorax is present. ET tube is in standard placement. Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Four transvenous right atrial pacer right ventricular pacer and pacer defibrillator leads are in standard placements unchanged. I cannot tell which of these leads originates with the right pectoral generator an which are abandoned leads from the left chest wall.
