The lungs are well expanded. There is a hazy opacity in the right upper lobe adjacent to the mediastinum which is likely due to rotasted position. No other focal opacities are noted bilaterally. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An esophageal tube is seen ending within the stomach.
