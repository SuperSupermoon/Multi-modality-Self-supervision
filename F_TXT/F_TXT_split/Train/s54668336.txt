Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs are somewhat low in volume with unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis. Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at the level of the superior cavoatrial junction. There is no pleural effusion. Assessment for pneumothorax limited on the supine view without evidence of large pneumothorax. The cardiac size and cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable.
