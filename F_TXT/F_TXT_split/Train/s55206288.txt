Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous. Apart from minimal atelectasis in the left lung base, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Minimal deformity of the left ninth and tenth posterolateral ribs may suggest acute or subacute rib fractures.
