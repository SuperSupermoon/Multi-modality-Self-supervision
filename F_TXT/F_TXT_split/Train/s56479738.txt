Sternotomy wires are intact. Significant interval decrease in size of cardiomediastinal silhouette. Lucency at the base of the right hemidiaphragm may represent pneumoperitoneum or small basal pneumothorax. No mediastinal shift or flattening of right hemidiaphragm. No pleural effusion. New right mid lung opacity is likely atelectasis; however, may represent evolving pneumonia. New mild left lower lobe atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged with normal mediastinal contour and hila.
