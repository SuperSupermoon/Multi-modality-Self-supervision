There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Rounded retrocardiac density may be related to hiatal hernia; however, the evaluation is limited. There is a moderate-sized left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. There is no convincing evidence of pneumonia. Engorgement of the bronchovascular structures, particularly in the right hila are likely related to low lung volumes rather than frank edema, although given the patient's marked cardiomegaly, correlation with BNP if the patient has signs of heart failure would be helpful.
