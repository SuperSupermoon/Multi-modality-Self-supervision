Dobbhoff catheter terminates in the stomach. A right internal jugular catheter courses into the lower SVC. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures and central venous engorgement could be explained by low lung volumes which are unchanged. The small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged and retrocardiac atelectasis persists. No pneumothorax.
