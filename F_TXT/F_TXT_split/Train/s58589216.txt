A single portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter, ending in the mid-to-low SVC. There is no pneumothorax. A moderate left pleural effusion persists. A small right pleural effusion remains possible. Ill-defined opacities at the right lung base are not significantly changed and could be atelectasis or pneumonia. Left basilar compressive atelectasis is again seen. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
