There has been no significant interval change. Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are again noted. Increased interstitial markings are similar in appearance. More dense bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Electronic device projects over left chest wall as on prior. Surgical clips project over the neck. No acute osseous abnormalities.
