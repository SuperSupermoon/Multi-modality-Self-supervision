As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, potentially resulting from increased ventilatory pressure. Otherwise, the lungs are unchanged. The previously described signs indicating pulmonary edema are no longer visible. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusion. No focal parenchymal opacities. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Sternal wires and clips after CABG in unchanged position. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
