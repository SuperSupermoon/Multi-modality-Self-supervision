As compared to ___ radiograph from 2 hr earlier, a large right pneumothorax has substantially decreased in size, with residual moderate pneumothorax remaining, with right pigtail pleural catheter in place. Along with partial re-expansion of the right lung, atelectasis in the right mid and lower lung have partially improved. Within the left lung, a small left apical pneumothorax is again demonstrated, along with improving left basilar atelectasis. No other relevant changes since recent study.
