AP portable supine view of the chest. ET tube tip located 5.0 cm above the carinal. The orogastric tube extends inferiorly towards the diaphragm though the tip is not within the imaged field. Right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the right rib cage raising potential concern for underlying rib fractures in the setting of prolonged CPR. No large right pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unremarkable aside from calcified thoracic aorta. Lungs appear relatively clear.
