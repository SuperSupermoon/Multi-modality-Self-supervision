Support and monitoring devices remain in standard position. Widespread subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated, as well as bibasilar hyperlucency suggestive of pneumothoraces, likely at least moderate in size, but additional lateral decubitus radiographs or upright views could be obtained to better quantify the size of the pneumothoraces, if warranted clinically. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance, and there is a suggestion of coexisting pneumomediastinum. Patchy opacity in left juxtahilar region has slightly worsened, and may reflect patchy atelectasis with or without a coexisting aspiration or pneumonia. Known bilateral rib fractures have been more fully characterized on prior CT. Findings discussed with Dr. ___ on ___ at 8:45 a.m. at the time of discovery.
