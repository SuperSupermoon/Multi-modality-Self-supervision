Severe bilateral pulmonary consolidation, perihilar on the left, more dependent on the right is most likely pulmonary edema. Concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded. Bilateral pleural effusions are small. Heart is top-normal size, but the contour of the left heart border raises possibility of apical left ventricular aneurysm. Of note a torso CT scan in ___ showed severe aortic valvular and extensive coronary atherosclerotic calcification, making aortic stenosis and severe coronary artery disease very likely. Transvenous right atrial and ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements continuous from the left axillary generator.
