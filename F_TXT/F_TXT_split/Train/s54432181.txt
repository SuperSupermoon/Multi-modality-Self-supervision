Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC. Cardiac silhouette size is difficult to determine due to the presence of moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right. These have slightly increased in size compared to the previous study. Compressive atelectasis is noted in both lung bases. No overt pulmonary edema is present. No pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized. Biliary stent in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen is incompletely imaged. Diffuse osseous metastatic disease is better assessed on the prior CT. Bilateral breast implants are again noted.
