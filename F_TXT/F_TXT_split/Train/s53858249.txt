In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube remains in stable position. Orogastric 2 terminates in the stomach. Low lung volumes accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Pulmonary vascular congestion persists. The left hemidiaphragm is not well seen, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probably some pleural effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, a superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
