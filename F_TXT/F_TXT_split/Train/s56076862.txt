The overlying trauma board somewhat limits evaluation. An endotracheal tube is 1.7 cm above the carina. An enteric tube terminates in the stomach. There is evidence of mild pulmonary edema centrally. Heart size is normal. A more focal consolidation seen in the right middle and upper lobes may reflect aspiration. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
