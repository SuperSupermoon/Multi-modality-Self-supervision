AP single view of the chest shows interval reduction of lung volumes with new left lung base opacity, probably due to left lower lobe aspiration. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is probably due to small pleural effusion. Right lung is otherwise clear. Heart size is still enlarged with stable mild vascular congestion.
