There has been no interval change from the prior study. Again seen are widespread parenchymal opacities with a predominant reticulonodular pattern compatible with underlying metastatic disease with superimposed pulmonary edema which is mild to moderate in extent, but not changed. Persistent small to moderate right, and small left pleural effusions are again noted. There is no pneumothorax.
