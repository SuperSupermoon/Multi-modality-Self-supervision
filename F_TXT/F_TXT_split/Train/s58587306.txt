AP chest compared to ___: Nearly global opacification of both lungs characterized as combination of interstitial infiltration, some chronic and fibrotic, and subsequent diffuse ground-glass alveolar opacification is slightly more pronounced today than it was on ___. This could be due to a small component of pulmonary edema independent of the complicated lung disease. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged over this admission, but mediastinal vascular engorgement has never been more pronounced. There may therefore be a component of right heart failure. Right PIC line ends low in the SVC. No pneumothorax.
