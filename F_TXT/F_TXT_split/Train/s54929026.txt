AP chest compared to ___: Nasogastric tube ends in the distal stomach. Lung volumes are appreciably lower now than on ___, and it is difficult to distinguish vascular crowding and atelectasis at the lung bases from aspiration. Low lung volumes exaggerate caliber of the mediastinum, due to tortuous thoracic aorta and possibly distended mediastinal veins. Heart size is normal. Pleural effusion is minimal, if any. No pneumothorax.
