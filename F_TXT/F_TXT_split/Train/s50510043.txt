The quality of the image is limited due to patient's body habitus. Allowing for these limitations, lung volumes are low, without focal opacities. Assessment of the left lung base is limited due to obscuration by severe cardiomegaly which is not significantly changed compared with prior exam. Mediastinal widening is secondary to mediastinal fat better assessed in prior CT. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A linear lucency crossing across the soft tissues in the left as well as the left lower lung field represents air trapped in a skinfold underneath the breast tissue. Sternotomy wires are intact.
