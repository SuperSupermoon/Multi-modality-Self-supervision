Compared to the immediate prior radiograph of earlier the same day, the patient has been intubated with the endotracheal tube ending 4.4 cm from the carina. A new enteric tube ends within the decompressed stomach. Moderate interstitial edema has increased slightly compared with the prior study. The right apical hydropneumothorax and right base opacities are unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
