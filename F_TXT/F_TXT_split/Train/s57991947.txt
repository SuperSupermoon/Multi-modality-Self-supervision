Lung volumes are low. Heart size appears moderately enlarged, but is accentuated due to the presence of low lung volumes. The aorta is tortuous. There is mild pulmonary edema with small to moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions, not substantially changed from the prior exam. Bibasilar opacities may reflect compressive atelectasis but infection cannot be completely excluded. No pneumothorax is identified. Severe degenerative changes are noted in both glenohumeral joints with narrowed acromiohumeral intervals bilaterally suggestive of underlying rotator cuff disease. No displaced fractures are visualized.
