AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ CT chest. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinum is grossly unremarkable. Focal opacities predominantly involving the right upper and right lower lobe are better appreciated on the prior chest CT. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Contrast material is still seen in the kidneys and might reflect substantial hydronephrosis versus extrarenal pelvis seen bilaterally but partially imaged on the prior study.
