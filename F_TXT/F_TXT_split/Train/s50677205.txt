The patient has had median sternotomy with intact and aligned sternotomy wires. Lung volumes are low. Moderate right has slightly increased, and the small left pleural effusion has slightly decreased post pigtail catheter drainage. A drainage catheter is partially imaged overlying the right costophrenic angle. Airspace disease or malignancy at either lung base cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
