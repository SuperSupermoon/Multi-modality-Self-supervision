There is suspected pneumoperitoneum, which appears new from the recent CT. Enteric tube is coiled in the pharynx and extends just beyond expected location of the GE junction. Left IJ CVC terminates at the upper SVC. ET tube terminates 3.8 cm above Carina. Low lung volumes with increased opacification of the bilateral chest, likely reflecting pulmonary edema.
