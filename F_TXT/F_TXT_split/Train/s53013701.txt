1. Interval removal of the right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with the introducer remaining in place and terminating in the proximal SVC. A dual-lead AICD remains in place. Lung volumes remain low. There is a small left effusion with some associated patchy airspace disease, but overall aeration in the left lung base has improved. Persistent low lung volumes. No evidence of pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. Stable calcified nodular opacity in the periphery of the right mid lung is again seen, likely representing a calcified granuloma given stability dating back to a chest film from ___. Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior cholecystectomy.
