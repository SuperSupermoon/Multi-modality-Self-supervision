Interval since prior study, the patient is a developed extremely extensive subcutaneous emphysema affecting the entire visual chest wall and extending into the supraclavicular region. In addition there is air tracking along the posterior mediastinum. The appearances are highly suspicious for an esophageal perforation. The extent of subcutaneous air limits assessment of the lungs, however no pneumothorax is visualized. An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the level the carina. Small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis. The right lung is grossly clear.
