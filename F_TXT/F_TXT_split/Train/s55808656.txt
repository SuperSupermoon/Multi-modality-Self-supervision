Portable view of the chest was reviewed. Again seen are median sternotomy wires as well as a prosthetic aortic valve, in standard positions. Significant mitral annular calcifications are again noted. There is mild cardiomegaly, stable over the past 10 days. A left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis obscures the left heart border. There is no pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary edema is seen. Slightly increased and more confluent interstitial markings in the right lateral mid lung may be indicative of an infectious process. Alternatively, mitral regurgitation may result in asymmetric right upper lobe pulmonary edema from aberrant blood flow into the right superior pulmonary vein.
