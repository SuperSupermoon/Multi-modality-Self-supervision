This is a rotated film with the patient leaning towards the right. There is a right-sided effusion layering laterally. This is likely increased compared to prior, but absolute changes are difficult to assess due to change in position. There is dense retrocardiac opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion involving the left lower lung. Please note that a left chest tube is in place; however, the port of the chest tube is projecting outside the chest wall. There is mild pulmonary vascular re-distribution and some hazy alveolar infiltrates affecting the upper lobes.
