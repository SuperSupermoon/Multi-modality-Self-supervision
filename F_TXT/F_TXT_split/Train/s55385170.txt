Leukemic pulmonary infiltrates are generally seen with extremely high blast cell counts. Widespread pneumonia is unlikely to progress so quickly and distributed as symmetrically. Noncardiogenic edema or a edema related to infusion of fluid or blood product, including TRALI, is a third diagnostic choice.
