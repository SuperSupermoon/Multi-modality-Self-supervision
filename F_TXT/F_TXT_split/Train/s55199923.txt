The heart is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Mild prominence of the superior mediastinum probably relates to tortuous vasculature and is unchanged. The lungs are well expanded and clear, without consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
