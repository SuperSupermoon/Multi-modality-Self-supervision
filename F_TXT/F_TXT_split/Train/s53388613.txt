As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased, likely caused by a decrease in ventilatory pressure. The extent and severity of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities are constant in extent and distribution. Also constant is the left lower lobe atelectasis, caused by a small left pleural effusion. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged monitoring and support devices. No pneumothorax.
