Tip of the endotracheal tube terminates 1.8 cm above the carina, but has been repositioned on a followup chest x-ray of 6:20 a.m. Left internal jugular catheter has a vertical course terminating approximately 2.9 cm below the medial aspect of the left clavicle, possibly within the left brachiocephalic vein, but not making the expected medial turn across the midline. There is no visible pneumothorax. Marked widening of the mediastinum is present, and may relate to reported acute aortic injury on subsequent CT. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Heterogeneous opacities are present throughout the right lung, and may be due to multifocal aspiration and/or contusion in the setting of recent trauma. Multifocal atelectasis is demonstrated in the left upper and left lower lobes, and there is also a small left effusion. Multiple left-sided rib fractures are present, and have been more fully characterized on the CT exam.
