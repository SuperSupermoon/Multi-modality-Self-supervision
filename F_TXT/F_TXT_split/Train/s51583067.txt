Frontal upright view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.2 cm above the carina. OG tube terminates below the diaphragm. Left IJ central catheter terminates in the upper SVC. Mild cardiomegaly and the cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Retrocardiac opacity and blunting of the costophrenic angles are compatible with bilateral effusions with atelectasis, similar to prior. A peripheral right mid-lung nodular opacity is likely fluid along the minor fissure as fluid was seen in this location on ___.
