Left pneumothorax is similar in appearance with small apical component and moderate loculated hydro pneumothorax component at the left base, the latter more fully evaluated by a recent CT of ___. Left pleural effusion has slightly increased in size, and note is made of worsening adjacent opacities in the left mid and lower lung. Linear atelectasis at right base is unchanged as well as a small right pleural effusion.
