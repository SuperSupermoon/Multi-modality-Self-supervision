As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left-sided chest drain. The extent of the pre-existing pleural fluid collection is substantially decreased. As a consequence, the left lung is better ventilated than on the previous image. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The lung volume on the right has increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The position of the left subclavian vein catheter is unchanged.
