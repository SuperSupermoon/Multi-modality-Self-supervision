Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Again, there are diffuse interstitial opacities with lower lobe predominance, compatible with patient's known interstitial disease, although interstitial opacities appear less prominent as compared to the prior study. No definite focal consolidation is seen. Relative opacity of the costophrenic angles more likely relates to overlying soft tissue rather than pleural effusions. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
