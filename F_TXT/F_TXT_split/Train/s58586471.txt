Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes, making evaluation suboptimal. There are perihilar opacities, left greater than right, which may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, although infectious process is not excluded. Given that the left costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image, no large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
