Tracheostomy tube has a different orientation compared to the prior study, and flexion of the patient's neck as well as kyphotic positioning also limit assessment of this structure. With this limitation in mind, there has been an apparent change in the position of this device, now terminating about 1.9 cm above the clavicles and with the tip apparently abutting the lateral wall of the proximal trachea. Feeding tube terminates below the diaphragm. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Right basilar atelectasis and adjacent small right pleural effusion are unchanged, but there has been overall improvement in aeration in the left lung base with residual linear atelectasis remaining. Position of tracheostomy tube has been discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 9:25 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.
