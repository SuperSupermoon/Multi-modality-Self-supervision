The endotracheal tube is 4.9 cm above the carina. Please note that the tube is directed towards the left lateral wall of the trachea, a change from prior. The right internal jugular catheter terminates in the upper SVC. A newly placed enteric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view. The extensive bilateral opacities from severe pneumonia are unchanged from earlier today. Lucency seen around the aortic knob is consistent with spared/aerated lung as shown on the prior CT, rather than free air. There is no pleural effusion. Heart size is normal.
