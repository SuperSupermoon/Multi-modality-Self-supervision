As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are constant. The lung volumes have slightly decreased. As a consequence, the pre-existing predominantly basal, but overall diffuse consolidations in opacities in the lungs appear denser than before. The overall extent of these changes, however, is likely to be constant. No pleural effusions, no increase in size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
