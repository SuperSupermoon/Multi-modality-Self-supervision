Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from earlier the same day at 21:50. Since prior, there has been interval placement of a right-sided central venous catheter. The exact tip is difficult to delineate given patient's positioning and severe thoracic dextroscoliosis; however, is thought to be perhaps just inferior to the RA-SVC junction, within the proximal right atrium. Otherwise, there has been no change. There is no visualized pneumothorax.
