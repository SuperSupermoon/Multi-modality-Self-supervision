There are low inspiratory volumes, though the possibility of background hyperinflation/COPD cannot be excluded. Suspect cardiomegaly, though this may be accentuated by low lung volumes. There is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, suggesting mild CHF. There is patchy opacity at the left lung base consistent with atelectasis, though an early pneumonic infiltrate would be difficult to exclude. No effusion is identified. At the edge of these films, hardware related to the left shoulder is noted.
