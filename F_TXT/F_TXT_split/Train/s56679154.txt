AP chest compared to ___: Pulmonary and mediastinal venous engorgement are new, since placement of the CoreValve, and there may be very mild edema at the lung bases. There is no appreciable pleural effusion, but heart size, though top normal, has increased since the preprocedure study. ET tube is in standard placement. A line, probably a temporary pacer, traverses a right jugular introducer, and ends with its tip projecting over the mid portion of the cardiac silhouette. This could be in the body of the right ventricle, as expected, but without a lateral view, I cannot be sure it is not in the coronary sinus. Of note, the stomach is severely distended with air and fluid. Notification was withheld because subsequent chest radiograph showed reversal of important abnormalities.
