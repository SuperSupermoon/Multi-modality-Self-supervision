There are small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions. Right base atelectasis is seen. Right base opacity may be due to combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, although underlying consolidation is not excluded. The cardiac silhouette appears top normal to mildly enlarged though the right aspect of the cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to overlying opacity. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
