Supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 3 cm below the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm and terminating in the expected location of the distal stomach. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Paratracheal opacity is again seen as also seen on the prior study. Subtle medial right base patchy opacity could relate to aspiration. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
