Portable frontal chest radiographs demonstrate an endotracheal tube terminating 3.4 cm above the level of the carina in appropriate position. A left subclavian line terminates in the low SVC. An enteric tube descends in an uncomplicated course, its terminal end outside the field of view. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Improved pulmonary edema is demonstrated by narrower vascular pedicle and dramatically improved transient pulmonary artery dilatation seen previously. Bibasilar consolidations are apparent, left worse than right, likely atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
