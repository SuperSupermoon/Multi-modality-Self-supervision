Comparison is made to the prior study from ___. There is a left-sided pacemaker with dual leads, which is stable. There is a right IJ central venous line with the distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction, stable. There has been poor inspiration since the previous study, with crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings. There is prominence of the vasculature consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. There is a developing left retrocardiac opacity which may represent areas of confluent edema versus developing consolidation. Closer attention to this area is recommended on subsequent exams.
