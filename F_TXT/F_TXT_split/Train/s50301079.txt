As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been slightly pulled back. The feeding tube is in unchanged position. The right internal jugular vein catheter was removed. The lung volumes remain low. There is unchanged evidence of mild to moderate pulmonary edema as well as of an opacity with air bronchograms that lines the right lung base and the left costophrenic sinus. No pneumothorax.
