Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Single lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen, with lead unchanged in position. There are relatively low lung volumes. Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature may be due to mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Cardiomegaly persists. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. There has been interval removal of a right-sided PICC. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
