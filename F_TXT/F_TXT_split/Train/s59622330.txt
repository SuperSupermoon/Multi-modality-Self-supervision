The lung volumes are low, partially explained by the recent left upper lobectomy. This results in crowding of the bronchovascular structures and apparent enlargement of the left pulmonary artery. A left chest tube is directed superiorly. There is no evidence for a pneumothorax on this semi erect supine chest radiograph. Small amount of fluid is seen in the right minor fissure. Heart size is unchanged. Prominence of the mediastinum is probably postsurgical.
