The endotracheal tube tip projects approximately 4 cm above the carina. An esophageal catheter courses below the diaphragm with tip out of view and side port projecting over the left upper quadrant. Lung volumes are low. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected. Heart size is top normal but may be exaggerated by positioning and low lung volumes.
