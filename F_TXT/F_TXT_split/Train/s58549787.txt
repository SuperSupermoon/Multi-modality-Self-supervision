The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with improvement in opacification at the left lung base. Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear. There is probably a small pleural effusion on the left but no suggestion of one on the right side.
