The tip of the left internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter extends to the left lower lobe of pulmonary artery. The endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea and a gastric tube extends into the gastric body. The tip of the left PICC line projects over the cavoatrial junction. There is a retrocardiac opacity which likely reflects a combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid. No definitive right pleural effusion is identified. No pneumothorax. The size and appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
