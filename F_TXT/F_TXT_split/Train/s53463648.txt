Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the patient in semi-upright position. The left subclavian line terminates in the lower SVC. Again seen is a right PICC terminating in the axilla. There are persistent opacities in the right upper lobe without evidence of volume loss. There is new moderate left basilar atelectasis, which results in obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
