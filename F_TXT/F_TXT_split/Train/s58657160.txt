Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates bilateral low lung volumes. Mediastinal and main pulmonary artery engorgement with dense air space opacification noted throughout both lungs as well as hazy pulmonary vasculature likely representing edema. Hear size is minimally enlarged. Retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis.
