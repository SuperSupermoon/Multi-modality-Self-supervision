The ET tube terminates approximately 5.3 cm above the carina. There is a right-sided subclavian catheter which terminates in the mid SVC. The lung volumes are low resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular structures; however, there appears to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The patient continues to display small bilateral pleural effusions and mild areas of bilateral basilar atelectasis. There may be mild pulmonary edema, overall unchanged compared to the prior exam. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
