Since the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, an entry are balloon pump has been repositioned, now terminating 4.6 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. Other support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position except for introduction of a Swan-Ganz catheter via an inferior vena cava approach, with tip terminating at the expected level of the main pulmonary artery proximal to the bifurcation. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by mild edema, and note is made of an apparent moderate layering left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion.
