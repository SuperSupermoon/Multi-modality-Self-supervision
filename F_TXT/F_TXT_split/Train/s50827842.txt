Comparison is made with prior study ___. Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions are slightly unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Left upper lobe atelectasis has worsened. Left lower lobe probably collapse is also unchanged. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated, is obscured by pleural and parenchymal abnormality. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC/cavoatrial junction. Most likely there is an underlying stable pulmonary edema.
