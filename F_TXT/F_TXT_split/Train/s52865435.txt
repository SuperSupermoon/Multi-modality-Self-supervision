There has been interval placement of a left pleural drain projecting over the left lung base. No pneumothorax identified. There are persisting left mid to lower lung zone airspace opacities as well as an underlying pleural effusion. The right lung demonstrates faint patchy opacities which may also reflect foci of pneumonia. The appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
