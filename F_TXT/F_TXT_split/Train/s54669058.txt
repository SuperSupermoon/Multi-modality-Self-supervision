The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and bibasilar atelectasis. Subtle increased right upper lobe opacity. Mild vascular congestion has improved. Small retrocardiac opacity is stable. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is top-normal in size, decreased since prior examination and likely accentuated due to low lung volumes. Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable. Interval removal of endotracheal tube and enteric feeding tube. Right IJ CVL tip is in the low SVC with left IJ CVL tip in the SVC junction.
