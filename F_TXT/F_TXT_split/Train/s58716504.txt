A new right lower chest tube has been placed which ends as a pigtail within the lower right hemithorax. There is a persistent moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion, but substantially reduced. Associated parenchymal opacity suggests persistent partial atelectasis of the right lung. Leftward shift of mediastinal structures has resolved. There is no definite pleural effusion on the left.
