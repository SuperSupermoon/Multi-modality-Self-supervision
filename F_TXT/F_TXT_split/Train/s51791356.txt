Again seen is a pacemaker type device, overlying the left upper chest, with 3 leads noted. It the inferior approach catheter seen on the prior film, presumably a Swan-Ganz catheter, has been removed. If again seen is a left-sided chest tube. No well-defined pneumothorax is identified, though subtle pneumothorax might not be apparent on this exam. On today's exam, a thin linear lucency projects over the cardiac silhouette, of uncertain etiology or significance. There has been some interval clearing of the left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with partial visualization of the left hemidiaphragm on today's exam. Vascular engorgement left upper zone is again noted, similar to the prior study. Possibility of a small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. Subcutaneous emphysema along the lower left chest wall again noted. The right lung is unchanged, with atelectasis in the infrahilar region. No CHF or right pleural effusion identified. Note is made that the right cardiac border is well defined. Small calcified granuloma in the right upper lung is again noted.
