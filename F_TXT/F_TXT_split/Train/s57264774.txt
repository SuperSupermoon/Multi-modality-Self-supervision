In comparison with the study ___ ___, the left Port-A-Cath has been repositioned so that the tip points downward at the level of the mid SVC. The right basilar opacification is less prominent than on the previous study and again could represent either decreasing atelectasis or consolidation. Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is no evidence of vascular congestion. Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base with obscuration of the costophrenic angle it could reflect a small pleural effusion.
