As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressure. Moderate cardiomegaly, mild fluid overload as well as retrocardiac and right basilar atelectasis persist. No pneumothorax. Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
