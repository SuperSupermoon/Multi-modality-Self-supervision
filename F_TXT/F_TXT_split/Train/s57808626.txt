Left lower lobe consolidation is worsening since yesterday and could be compatible with aspiration and pneumonia. ET tube ends 2 cm above carina. Left-sided subclavian line ends in upper SVC. The lung volumes are low. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are mildly enlarged and unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
