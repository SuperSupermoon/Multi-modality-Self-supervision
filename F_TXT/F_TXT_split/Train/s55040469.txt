The endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above the level of the carina. Recommend proximal repositioning by at least 2 cm. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm and is at least within the stomach, though the tip is incompletely imaged. Widening of the mediastinal contours corresponds with patient's known adenopathy. Known pulmonary masses within the right upper lobe and right lower lobe are not well characterized on this examination. There is no new consolidation or pneumothorax. There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusions. A moderate-sized hiatal hernia is stable. Compression deformity and vertebroplasty of the T11 vertebral body is stable.
