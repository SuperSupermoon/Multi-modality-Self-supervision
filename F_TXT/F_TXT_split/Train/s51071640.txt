Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Apart from mild atelectasis in the lung bases, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, although the left apex is somewhat obscured due to the patient's chin projecting over this region. The pulmonary vascularity is normal. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
