As compared to prior examination, the lungs appear somewhat better aerated. Redemonstrated is hyperinflation with flattening of hemidiaphragms, consistent with COPD. Also seen again is biapical scarring and increased prominence of interstitial markings, consistent with chronic lung disease. Previously identified right upper lobe nodule is no longer seen. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Surgical ___, suture material, and coils are noted overlying the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
