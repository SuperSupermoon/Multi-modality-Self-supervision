Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. Lungs are diminished in volume but the parenchymal distortion is once again seen consistent with known underlying emphysema. There has been interval appearance of patchy opacity in the retrocardiac area which more likely reflects atelectasis, although aspiration and developing pneumonia should also be considered. No pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with the heart being stably enlarged.
