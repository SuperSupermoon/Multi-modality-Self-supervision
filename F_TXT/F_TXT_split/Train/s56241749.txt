There is an endotracheal tube with tip terminating in the mid thoracic trachea in good position. An enteric tube is seen with distal tip projecting over the left upper quadrant, side-port seen distal to the GE junction. EKG leads overlie the chest. Lung volumes are low. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated in the setting of low lung volumes. The hila are within normal limits. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, however difficult to exclude superimposed infection in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no pulmonary edema. Elsewhere there is no evidence of focal lung consolidation. There is no pneumothorax or sizable pleural effusion.
