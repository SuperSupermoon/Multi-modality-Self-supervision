A portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a large left-sided pneumothorax and substantial left lower lung collapse with mediastinal shift to the left. The bilateral chest tubes remain in place. There is a stable appearing small right-sided pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet level, with persistent apparent overdistention of the endotracheal tube cuff.
