Frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates the tracheostomy tube terminating approximately 2.2 cm above the carina. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, although this may be in part due to projection. Calcifications of the aortic knob are again noted. Streaky opacities in the right base are consistent with atelectasis. The left hemidiaphragm is minimally better seen compared to ___. Left base opacity may reflect atelectasis, although sequela of aspiration cannot be excluded. No new focal consolidation identified. There is no pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
