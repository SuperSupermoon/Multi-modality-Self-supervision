There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating in the proximal SVC/SVC brachiocephalic junction, without new pneumothorax seen. The left lung is hyperinflated and relatively lucent, likely due to underlying COPD. There is a large lucency projecting over the right mid-to-lower lung which may represent a large bleb, underlying loculated pneumothorax is not excluded. Opacity at the right upper lung is again seen, which may be due to some volume loss, underlying aspiration, infection not excluded. Previously noted nodular opacity projecting over the right upper lung is no longer appreciated. No priors available for comparison. There is scarring and evidence of some volume loss on the right with some shift of the mediastinum to the right, correlate with history of prior procedure to the right hemithorax/lung. Endotracheal tube is approximately 2.5 cm at the level of the carina. The nasogastric tube is similar in appearance, with side port at the GE junction/distal esophagus and in the very proximal stomach. As suggested previously, recommend advancement so that it is well within the stomach. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are similar.
