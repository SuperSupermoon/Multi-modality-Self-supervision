Comparison is made with prior study ___. There are low lung volumes. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube is in standard position. Left IJ catheter is in unchanged position with tip in the left brachiocephalic vein. There is no pneumothorax. Right pleural effusion is moderate and probably unchanged, allowing difference in positioning of the patient. There are persistent low lung volumes. Mild pulmonary edema is minimally increased. Lumbar spinal hardware and drains in the left upper quadrant are again noted.
