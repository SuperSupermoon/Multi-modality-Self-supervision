As compared to previous radiograph, the lung transparency has increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The monitoring and support devices are constant. Constant in extent are the bilateral pleural effusions and the areas of parenchymal opacities, notably in the left perihilar region. No evidence of pneumothorax.
