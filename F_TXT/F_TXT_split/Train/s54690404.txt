Endotracheal tube unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. Bilateral linear opacities likely reflect scarring or atelectasis. Due to the overlying motion, evaluation for subtle interval change cannot be assessed. No obvious pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Right hemidiaphragm remains mildly elevated.
