1. Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube with the tip at the thoracic inlet. There is worsening airspace consolidation in the right upper, right middle and lower lobes as well as within the left upper and lower lobes consistent with worsening pneumonia, less likely pulmonary edema. The airspace consolidation obscures the cardiac and mediastinal contours limiting evaluation. The stomach is incompletely visualized but appears to be distended with gas. There is likely a layering left effusion.
