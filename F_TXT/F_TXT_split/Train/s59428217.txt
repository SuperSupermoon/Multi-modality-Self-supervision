Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The heart size, which is mildly enlarged, is slightly increased compared to the prior exam, likely related to inspiratory effort. The heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. The lungs are clear. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Dilated loop of bowel is again seen in the left upper quadrant. Left-sided central catheter terminates in the lower SVC. No free abdominal air is identified.
