Left chest tube remains in place, with moderate left apical pneumothorax, slightly increased from prior study. Visceral pleural line is just above the left fifth posterior rib. There may also be a smaller basilar component of the pneumothorax, which appears slightly less prominent than on the prior study. Overall appearance of the chest is otherwise similar to prior study except for worsening opacities at the left lung base involving the left lower lobe and lingula.
