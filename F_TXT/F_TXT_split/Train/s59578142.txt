In the interval, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 2 cm above the carina, the tube could be pulled back by about 1 cm. The patient also has a nasogastric tube that is coiled in the stomach. The tip of the tube is not included on the image. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt shows an unchanged course. The volumes of the lungs have decreased with areas of atelectasis at both lung bases. In addition, there is a zone of increased perihilar density, likely reflecting atelectasis. However, short-term radiograph is indicated to exclude developing pneumonia. No evidence of pneumothorax. No larger pleural effusions.
