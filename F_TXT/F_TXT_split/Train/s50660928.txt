The patient has been intubated since the prior examination, the endotracheal tube terminates about 2.5 cm above the carina. A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device has leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. An orogastric tube terminates near the gastroesophageal junction. The stomach is mild to moderately distended. An interstitial abnormality with indistinct pulmonary vessels and peribronchial cuffing has increased since the prior study. Although somewhat asymmetric, more prominent on the right than left, pulmonary edema is the most likely reason. Widespread pneumonia could be considered, however. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cholecystectomy clips project over the right upper quadrant.
