Single portable view of the chest. There are hazy bibasilar opacities suggestive of effusions. Underlying atelectasis and consolidation are also possible. Linear opacity in the left mid lung most suggestive of atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette appears grossly within normal limits for technique and low lung volumes. Density projects over one of the lower thoracic vertebral bodies, from possible prior vertebroplasty. IVC filter is partially visualized.
