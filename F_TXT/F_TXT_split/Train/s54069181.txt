Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Additionally, there is right upper lobe consolidation. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and not optimally assessed due to the adjacent bibasilar opacities. Perihilar prominence and indistinctness of the hila while not well evaluated, could relate to fluid overload.
