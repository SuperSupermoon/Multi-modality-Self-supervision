There has been interval placement of a right pleural pigtail catheter with essentially complete resolution of the previously described pneumothorax. The lung volumes are low, but opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle may represent hemorrhage from recent biopsy of the right lower lobe. Scarring/atelectasis is present along the medial aspect of the left lung, possibly representing prior radiation. The heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
