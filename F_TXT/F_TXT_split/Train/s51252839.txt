Portable AP upright radiograph demonstrates patchy opacity at the left lower lung zone which may reflect aspiration or alternatively atelectasis. Lungs are otherwise clear with no focal opacity convincing for pneumonia. Vascular congestion and distended azygos vein are noted, and potentially might represent volume overload, mild Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No air under the right hemidiaphragm is visualized. No large pleural effusion is seen. Osseous structures demonstrates no acute abnormality.
