There is been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube with pigtail formed along the periphery of the left mid lung field. Previously noted large pneumothorax has slightly decreased in size with improved aeration of the atelectatic left lung. Previously noted mild rightward shift of mediastinal structures has nearly completely resolved. The right lung remains emphysematous and hyperinflated. No pleural effusion or new focal consolidation is demonstrated. Heart size is normal. No pulmonary edema is seen. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the left lateral chest, new in the interval, related to chest tube placement.
