There is a right chest Port-A-Cath with distal tip projecting over the mid right mediastinum, likely in the low SVC although this assessment is difficult given right lung field opacity. There are aortic arch calcifications. Heart size is difficult to assess. There is a large right pleural effusion with near complete collapse of the right lung. Portions of the right upper lobe appear well-aerated. There is a smaller, likely moderate left pleural effusion, with significant atelectasis of the left lung. The aerated left upper lung appears clear. There is no pneumothorax.
