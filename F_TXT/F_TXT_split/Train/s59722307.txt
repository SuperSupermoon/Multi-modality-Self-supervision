As compared to the previous image, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. However, over distension of the stomach is still present. This could be relieved by insertion of a nasogastric tube. Moderate cardiomegaly and elongation of the descending aorta persist. Mild atelectasis at the left lung bases. No evidence of overt pulmonary edema or new parenchymal opacities potentially suggestive of pneumonia.
