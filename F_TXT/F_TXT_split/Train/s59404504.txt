Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and vascular engorgement without evidence of pulmonary edema. Subtle opacities have developed at the left lung base, with associated partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, as well as apparent slight blunting of the lateral left costophrenic sulcus. Observed findings could be due to the combination of small left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis, but developing left lower lobe pneumonia is possible given history of fever. Followup PA and lateral chest radiograph may be helpful in this regard.
