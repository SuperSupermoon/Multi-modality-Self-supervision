In comparison with the study of earlier and this date, there is a left pigtail catheter in place. The hazy opacification in the mid and lower left lung is less prominent. The opacification along the left lateral chest wall is unchanged on this single frontal view. A lateral view would be necessary to properly evaluate the appearance of the pleural collection following chest tube placement. No evidence of pneumothorax.
