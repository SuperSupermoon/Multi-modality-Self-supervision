I do not see a radio-opaque pleural drainage tube. There is no pneumothorax. Large right and moderate left pleural effusion are still present and bibasilar atelectasis is still severe. Heart is shifted to the left. With the chin partially flexed, the ET tube, tip 3.5 cm from the carina, is in standard placement. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC.
