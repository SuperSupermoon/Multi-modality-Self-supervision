AP chest radiograph As compared to prior studies obtained the prior, there is no change in the position of the ET tube, NG tube, and bilateral chest tubes. The areas of bibasal atelectasis are present and note is made that the study demonstrates lower lung volumes than previously, potentially reflecting expiratory phase of imaging. Bilateral rib fractures, multiple, are re-demonstrated. It is impossible to exclude flail chest on the current examination and correlation with cross-sectional imaging is required. Of note is right scapular fracture, better assessed on the current study as compared to prior imaging.
