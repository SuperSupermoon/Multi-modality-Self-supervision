The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. Streaky left lower lobe atelectasis is noted. A rounded density in the left hilar region may reflect partially calcified lymphadenopathy. No right hilar adenopathy is identified. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
