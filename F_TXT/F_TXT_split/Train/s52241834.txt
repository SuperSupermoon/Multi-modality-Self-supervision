AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs. Extremely lordotic view distorts the thoracic anatomy. Crowding of dilated vessels in the right lung apex could mask new region of consolidation though this would be an unusual location for aspiration pneumonia. When feasible, repeat radiograph should be obtained using standard positioning. Lower lungs are clear aside from small region of the cardiac apex which is obscured, either by abnormal lung or mediastinal fat. Heart is normal size. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
