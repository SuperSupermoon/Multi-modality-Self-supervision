Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates endotracheal tube tip projecting approximately 4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube terminates at the gastroesophageal junction with side port within the esophagus. Lung volumes are low, which accentuate bronchovascular markings. No pleural effusion or focal consolidation. Heart remains moderately enlarged. Remote right-sided rib injuries are again noted.
