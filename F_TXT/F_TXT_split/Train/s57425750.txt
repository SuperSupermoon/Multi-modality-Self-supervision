A left subclavian central line is present, tip over distal SVC. A Dobbhoff tube is present. The radiopaque portion of the Dobbhoff tube overlies the lower mediastinum and should be advanced. Please see report of subsequent chest x-ray obtained at 7:47 a.m., which shows advancement of this Dobbhoff tube beneath the diaphragm. Prominence of cardiomediastinal silhouette, upper zone re-distribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. Patchy opacity left base, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Small bilateral effusions cannot be excluded.
