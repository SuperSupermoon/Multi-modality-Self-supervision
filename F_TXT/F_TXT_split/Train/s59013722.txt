As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone right thoracocentesis. The right pleural effusion has decreased, a Minidrain is visible projecting over the right costophrenic sinus. On the left, a pre-existing small to moderate pleural effusion has moderately increased in extent, causing increased atelectasis, notably in the retrocardiac lung regions. There is no evidence of a left or right pneumothorax. The very extensive bilateral pulmonary nodules are unchanged. Unchanged evidence of osteosclerotic vertebral disease. Unchanged right pectoral Port-A-Cath.
