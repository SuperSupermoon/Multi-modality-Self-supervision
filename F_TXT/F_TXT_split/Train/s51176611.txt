Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged. The aorta is unfolded. Widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to supine positioning, AP technique, and low lung volumes. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, likely reflective of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are no acutely displaced fractures. Degenerative changes are seen involving both acromioclavicular joints and within the thoracic spine.
