Comparison is made with prior study performed nine hours earlier. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is noted new in the neck bilaterally and in the right chest, and increased in the left hemithorax. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable and midline. There are no large pleural effusions. Left chest tube is in unchanged position. Previously noted left pneumothorax is difficult to evaluate given the presence of air in the subcutaneous tissues of the left chest wall.
