Right-sided Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position. There is a moderate to large right-sided hydro-pneumothorax seen predominantly at the right base status post recent thoracentesis. The amount of right pleural fluid is markedly decreased. A small to moderate left-sided pleural effusion is minimally increased. Adjacent pulmonary opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis. Opacity at the base of the right lung likely reflects atelectasis.
