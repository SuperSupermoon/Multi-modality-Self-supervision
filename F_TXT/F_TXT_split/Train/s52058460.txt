Again noted are multiple left-sided rib fractures. There is no evidence of a large pneumothorax but a small persistent left-sided pneumothorax cannot be excluded. There is no shift of the midline structures. There are slightly increased opacities in the left lung, likely suggestive of atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette appears prominent. No pleural effusion is identified.
