Left apical pneumothorax is not well seen. There is a persistent small apical opacity along the superior medial left lung border, unchanged. There is a right IJ central line with the distal lead tip in the right atrium. This is unchanged in position and could be pulled back approximately 4 cm to be at the cavoatrial junction. Heart size is enlarged but stable. There is a left retrocardiac opacity and bilateral small pleural effusions, stable. There has been improvement of the mild pulmonary interstitial edema since the previous study.
