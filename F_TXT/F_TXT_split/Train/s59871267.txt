Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the day before. The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina. Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. Lungs are essentially clear except for left lower lobe linear opacity most likely reflecting aspiration or atelectasis, attention to this area on the subsequent radiograph is required.
