Pleural calcifications along the right hemidiaphragmatic contour again noted. Calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes along with a calcified granuloma at the left lung are again noted. There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis. No pleural effusion is seen in the right costophrenic angle is sharp. Curvilinear calcification is noted along the periphery of the spleen.
