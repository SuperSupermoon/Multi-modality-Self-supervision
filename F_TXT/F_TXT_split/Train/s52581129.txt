As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. There is minimal blunting of the left and right costophrenic sinus, potentially indicative of the presence of small pleural effusions. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema. No pneumonia, no pneumothorax.
