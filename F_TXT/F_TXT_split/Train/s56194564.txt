Evaluation of the lung fields is limited due to respiratory motion. The right lung is well aerated. New increased perihilar opacity and peribronchial cuffing in the left perihilar region is consistent with interval development of heart failure. Retrocardiac opacities are compatible with the known hiatal hernia. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax are identified. The heart size is difficult to determine, but likely mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic.
