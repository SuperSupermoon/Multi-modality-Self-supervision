Lung volumes remain low accentuating the cardiomediastinal silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Opacities at both lung bases are likely related to atelectasis. Lungs are otherwise clear. No new focal consolidation identified. In the setting of extremely low lung volumes, however, it is difficult to assess the cardiovascular status. There is no pneumothorax. There is a slightly displaced fracture of the anterior left second rib, with a slightly sclerotic border suggesting subacute etiology.
