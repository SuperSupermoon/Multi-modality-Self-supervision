There has been improved aeration of the lung bases with slight residual remaining in the retrocardiac left lower lobe. Mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature is evident and which may be in part indicative of underlying interstitial edema. There has been prior median sternotomy. The cardiac silhouette remains borderline enlarged but stable. No definite effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The osseous structures are unremarkable.
