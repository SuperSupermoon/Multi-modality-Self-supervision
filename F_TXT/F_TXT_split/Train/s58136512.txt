Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Moderate right pleural effusion is similar in size compared to the prior study with associated right basilar opacity, which may reflect compressive atelectasis. There is minimal streaky left basilar atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is improved compared to the previous study. No pneumothorax is identified.
