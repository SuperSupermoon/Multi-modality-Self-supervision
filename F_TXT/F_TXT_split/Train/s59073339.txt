Small left apical pneumothorax is slightly decreased in size with two chest tubes in place. Small right apical lateral pneumothorax is similar to the prior study, with one chest tube remaining in place. Widened mediastinum is similar to the prior radiograph, and postoperative changes related to aortic repair appear similar as well. Interval improvement in left perihilar and basilar opacification with residual opacities now localized to the retrocardiac area. Right lung is hyperexpanded, but grossly clear.
