AP chest compared to ___, 7:49 a.m.: There has been very little change. The postoperative right lung is slightly better aerated, but still largely consolidated and the persistent right pleural space is large, now filled with more fluid. Right basal pleural drain unchanged in position. Borderline perihilar edema, left lung, unchanged. Extent of rightward mediastinal shift has not improved. ET tube is in standard placement, but nasogastric tube still needs to be advanced at least 15 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach, as noted previously.
