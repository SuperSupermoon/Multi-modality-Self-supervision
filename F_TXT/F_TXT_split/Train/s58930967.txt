AP chest compared to ___: Postoperative right lung remains collapsed and a small-to-moderate volume of right pleural fluid has collected, pooled at the bottom of the persistent right apical pleural space, otherwise air-filled. Right pleural drain still in place. Left lung grossly clear. Mediastinum still shifted markedly to the right, makes evaluation of the heart size is difficult. The stomach is moderately to some significantly distended with air and fluid.
