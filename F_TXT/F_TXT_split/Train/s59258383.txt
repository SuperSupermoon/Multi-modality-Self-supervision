There is a new right central line with tip in the distal SVC. The ET tube and NG tube are unchanged. There continues to be elevated left hemidiaphragm with volume loss in the left lower lobe an underlying infectious infiltrate in this region can't be excluded. There is also some increased opacity in the right lower lobe suggesting an area volume loss/early infiltrate as well.
