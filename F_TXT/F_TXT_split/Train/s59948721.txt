AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained at 5:50 p.m. on the same day. The NG tube has been removed. There is cardiomegaly, vascular engorgement, bilateral pleural effusions and potentially bibasal atelectasis. The prior study was obtained on an abnormal angle that the appearance of the esophagus might be increasing concerns. On the current study, no definitive abnormal air collection is demonstrated. If clinically warranted, correlation with CT of the chest might be considered.
