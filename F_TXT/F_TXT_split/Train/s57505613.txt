1. Right internal jugular introducer remains in place with its tip in the proximal SVC. The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Lungs appear well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with calcification of the aortic knob consistent with atherosclerosis. There is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air or pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
