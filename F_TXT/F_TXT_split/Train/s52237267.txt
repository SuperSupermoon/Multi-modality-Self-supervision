There is mild worsening of right focal opacities, that were not present on ___, likely representing pneumonia. Left base opacity is likely due to atelectasis. In addition, there is widening of the vascular pedicle with dilated azygos vein and bilateral diffuse opacities, likely indicating pulmonary edema. Pleural effusions are unlikely. Again seen are extensive bilateral interstitial opacities, previously described as NSIP, unchanged from prior. Pigtail catheter is seen projecting over left mid lung. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.
