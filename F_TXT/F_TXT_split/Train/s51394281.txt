Indwelling support and monitoring devices are remarkable for repositioning of a left PICC, which now terminates in the body of the right atrium. Enlarged cardiac silhouette is unchanged, accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal perihilar edema. Improved left lower lobe atelectasis with persistent small left pleural effusion. New patchy and linear right lower lobe opacity likely represents atelectasis. Previously present intraperitoneal air has substantially decreased in extent.
