The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD. Probable mild cardiomegaly. The aorta is calcified an minimally unfolded. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise within normal limits. No CHF or pleural effusion is identified. Minimal retrocardiac opacity is noted-- this is compatible with atelectasis, but an early infectious infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded. Minimal subsegmental atelectasis at the right base. Deformity of both humeral heads is compatible with severe glenohumeral osteoarthritis, possibly with associated humeral head osteonecrosis.
