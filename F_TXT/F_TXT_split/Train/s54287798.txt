CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 7:18 a.m., the ET tube and nasogastric-type tubes have been removed. Right IJ and left subclavian central lines both overlie the distal SVC. There are low inspiratory volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged. There is upper zone re-distribution, vascular plethora and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is increased opacity at the left base, likely representing a combination of a moderate-sized pleural effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is atelectasis at the right base and possible minimal blunting at the right costophrenic angle. Compared with the earlier film, the CHF findings are similar, possibly slightly worse. The changes at the left base are stable.
