AP chest compared to ___: A previous mild pulmonary edema and a right pleural effusion have improved. Left lung is encased in restrictive calcific fibrothorax, which obscures most of the lung, but I doubt there has been much change or any improvement in generally poor aeration. There has been no appreciable change since ___ removal of the left basal pleural drain. A sliver of gas projecting over the left heart border could be in either the pleural space or the mediastinum. If there is any pneumothorax, it is small. ET tube in standard placement. Left jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC. Heart is top normal size.
