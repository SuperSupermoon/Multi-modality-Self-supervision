As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new left-sided central venous access line. The intravascular portion of the line traverses the brachiocephalic vein and ends with the tip pointing perpendicularly to the lateral wall of the superior vena cava. A catheter tip positioned further down in the vena cava and with the device being parallel to the vessel would be more desirable. However, no signs of mediastinal widening that could suggest extravasation are currently noted. No pneumothorax. Mild atelectasis at the left lung bases. Mild cardiomegaly. A previously placed right PICC line has been removed in the interval.
