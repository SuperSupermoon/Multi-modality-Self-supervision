Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube tip is in standard position; the tip is 4.1 cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter tip is in the cavoatrial junction. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Cardiomegaly is stable. Aortic stent is again noted. Mild-to-moderate fluid overload is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are also stable.
