AP chest compared to ___: Previous left basal and anterior pneumothorax has been replaced with fluid, a moderate right pleural effusion is also larger. Chest CT on ___ confirms that the more medial left pleural tube is fissural and more laterally is posterior. This might represent a problem in draining recurrent pneumothorax or pleural fluid loculated in the lower chest. Most striking is the increase in the apparent diameter of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, particularly the cardiac consistent with worsening now severe cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. There is also enough widening of the upper mediastinum to suggest mediastinal venous engorgement. ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube passes at least as far as the mid stomach. There is no pneumothorax currently. Dr. ___ was paged at 9:45, at the time of the findings were recognized.
