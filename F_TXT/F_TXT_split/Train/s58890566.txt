The radiograph is underpenetrated secondary to the patient's body habitus. Allowing for this limitation, the lungs are well expanded. There are slightly increased interstitial opacities compared with prior chest radiographs, but no focal parenchymal opacity. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Costophrenic angles are partially obscured potentially from overlying soft tissue/technique versus small effusions. There is no pneumothorax. A left-sided PICC line ends in the lower SVC.
