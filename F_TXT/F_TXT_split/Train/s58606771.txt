AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes have improved substantially, and aeration has increased, particularly in the left lower lung which was nearly entirely consolidated. Today, there is a band of atelectasis in each mid lung, but no good evidence for pneumonia and no pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. Right PICC line ends before the origin of the SVC. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
