As compared to the previous image, the patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube was removed. The lung volumes have decreased, revealing new sounds of parenchymal atelectasis at the lung bases. The pre-existing parenchymal opacity in the perihilar lung regions on the left is overall unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No larger pleural effusions. The overdistension of the transverse colon is constant in appearance.
