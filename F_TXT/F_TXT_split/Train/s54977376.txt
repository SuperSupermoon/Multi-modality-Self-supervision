Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the mid SVC. Status post median sternotomy with stably enlarged postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Lung volumes are lower with crowding of the vasculature and there is worsening superimposed pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities with associated effusions are again seen consistent with partial lower lobe compressive atelectasis. Pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax.
