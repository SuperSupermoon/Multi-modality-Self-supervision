AP chest compared to ___: Asymmetric pulmonary edema continues to clear in the right upper lung, but worsens everywhere else. Lung bases are more severely consolidated today than before. Moderate right pleural effusion is slightly smaller. Small left pleural effusion is presumed. Mediastinal veins are not distended. Heart is only moderately enlarged. Although remote chest radiographs have shown hyperinflated lungs, CT scan did not confirm emphysema, so there is no easy explanation for the asymmetry in pulmonary findings. I would strongly recommend consideration of CT scanning, with possible CTA to evaluate pneumonia or even major pulmonary emboli explaining the current findings. It should be noted that subsequent chest radiograph, 7:53 a.m. on ___, available at the time of this review showed improvement in the edema in the left lung and worsening bibasilar consolidation, an indication of at least progressive atelectasis and possibly pneumonia. See subsequent report.
