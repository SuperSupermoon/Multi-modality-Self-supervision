When compared to prior, there is new airspace disease in the left mid to lower lung. The right lung is essentially clear with minimal opacity at the right costophrenic angle perhaps slightly increased since prior. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities.
