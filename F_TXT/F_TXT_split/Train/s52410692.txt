1. Interval resolution of the pulmonary edema. There is persistent consolidative opacity in the right mid-to-lower lung and in the retrocardiac region. These findings would be more concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There are possibly small layering effusions. No pneumothorax. A single-lead left-sided pacer, right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position.
