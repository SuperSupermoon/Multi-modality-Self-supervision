AP chest compared to ___: Asymmetric pulmonary edema, previously in the partially atelectatic left lung has improved substantially. Previous left apical pneumothorax has resolved, since removal of the left basal pleural tube. Severe cardiac enlargement is more pronounced, perhaps a function of extubation. Mediastinal widening could also be due to vascular engorgement or even accumulation of fluid, since midline drains have been removed at the same time. Right jugular line ends in the right atrium. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
