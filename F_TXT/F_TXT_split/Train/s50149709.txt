In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the pigtail catheter on the right has been removed and replaced with a right chest tube. A second chest tube is seen in the right mid zone. The apical pneumothorax has decreased, though there appears to be an area of loculated air collection at the right base laterally. There has been substantial increase in subcutaneous gas along the right lateral chest wall and especially in the right supraclavicular region. Gas overlying the midline in the lower neck and upper thorax raises the possibility of pneumomediastinum. Continued opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
