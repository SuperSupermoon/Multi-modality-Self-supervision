The lung volumes are somewhat low. The left hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated. There is streaky density bilaterally most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. Bronchovascular markings are prominent. There is no focal consolidation. The heart and mediastinal structures are unremarkable for technique. The bony thorax is grossly intact. Ill-defined increased density is no longer apparent at the right lung base. There is no other significant change.
