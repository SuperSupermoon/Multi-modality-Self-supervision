Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest was provided. There is again noted to be an NG tube, which courses into the upper abdomen. A PICC line is unchanged with its tip terminating in the SVC region. A large right pleural effusion appears slightly increased from prior exam, now large, with associated consolidation which could represent compressive atelectasis or possibly pneumonia. There is left basal atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Heart size cannot be assessed. Bony structures are intact.
