ET tube terminates 4.2 cm above carina. Enteric tube extends to the stomach beyond lower aspect of the image. Right IJ sheath and left IJ CVC terminate in the distal SVC. Fluffy bilateral alveolar opacities are overall similar to prior, likely reflecting pulmonary edema. Slightly decreased blunting of the left costophrenic angle compared to prior. No pneumothorax.
