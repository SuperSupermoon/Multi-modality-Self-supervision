Study is slightly limited due to patient positioning. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Heart size is moderately enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. Streaky patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures likely due to low lung volumes. Trace blunting of the right costophrenic angle may suggest the presence of a trace pleural effusion. No left-sided pleural effusion is identified, and there is no pneumothorax. Multilevel degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine, as well as within the right glenohumeral joint.
