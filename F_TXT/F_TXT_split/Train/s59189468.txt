A trauma board overlies the patient. The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The lungs are underinflated, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. Linear bibasilar opacities are most compatible with atelectasis. Multiple left rib fractures are better evaluated on the CT torso examination performed earlier.
