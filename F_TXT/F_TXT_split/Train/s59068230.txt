Since the prior exam, the endotracheal tube has been removed. A new tracheostomy tube sits 7.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube and right PICC are unchanged. The opacity at the right base appears slightly improved since the prior exam, while an opacity at the left base appears worse. These changes may be due to patient rotation. Small bilateral pleural effusions are not significantly changed. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is poorly evaluated due to patient rotation.
