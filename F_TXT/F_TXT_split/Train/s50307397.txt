AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. Heart size in comparison made on the frontal views has not significantly changed, thus cardiogenic pulmonary edema is unlikely. There are new bilateral hazy densities on the lung bases, more marked on the left side where the diaphragmatic contour is completely obliterated. This is related to a pleural effusion which also blunts the lateral pleural sinus. The right-sided pleural sinus remains free, but the hazy density is similar to that on the left side, probably represents smaller amount of pleural effusion layering in the posterior compartment of the pleural space with the patient in recumbent position. There is no evidence of new acute parenchymal infiltrates, and the pulmonary vasculature does not show any congestive pattern.
