Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of the chest tube with tip difficult to evaluate but appears to be along the left base. There is increased dense opacification of the left hemithorax with air bronchograms present in the retrocardiac position. Increased density likely combination of known large left upper lobe mass as well as increased left lower lobe collapse and increased left pleural effusion. Right mediastinal and hilar borders are unremarkable. Right lung is clear. The right-sided pleural effusion evident.
