An endotracheal tube has been placed. The tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina. There is an orogastric tube which terminates in the cardia of the stomach, although the sidehole is in the lower esophagus. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The lungs appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Cholecystectomy clips project over the right upper quadrant.
