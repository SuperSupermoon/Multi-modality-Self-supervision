Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.5 cm above the level of the carina. There are low lung volumes. Patchy right upper lobe opacity could relate to low lung volumes and artifact, although an underlying consolidation can be present. No additional consolidation is seen. The right costophrenic angle is not included on the image. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are likely accentuated by supine, AP technique. No overt pulmonary edema. Gaseous distention of the colon is incidentally noted.
