As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased and the lung bases are bilaterally better ventilated than on the previous image. Small bilateral pleural effusions and basal areas of atelectasis persist. No new focal parenchymal opacities. Unchanged position of the pacemaker, the left internal jugular vein catheter and the alignment of the sternal wires continues to be unremarkable.
