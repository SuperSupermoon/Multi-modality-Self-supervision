The endotracheal tube ends 3.5 cm above the level of the carina. A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC. An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm, extending into the first portion of the duodenum. Dense left retrocardiac opacification is concerning for infection versus aspiration, although atelectasis could have a similar appearance. Bandlike atelectasis in the left lower lung is increased. Heterogeneous opacities at the right lung base are also increased, concerning for infection/aspiration. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not significantly changed. There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.
