As compared to chest CTA of ___, cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present. Subtle scattered small lung opacities are difficult to assess on a portable radiograph. Diffuse haziness overlying the left mid and lower lung is probably due to overlying breast tissue, but a partially layering pleural effusion could produce a similar radiographic appearance. Considering the presence of the eosinophilia and subtle abnormalities on recent chest CTA, a repeat CT may be helpful to more fully assess the lung parenchyma.
