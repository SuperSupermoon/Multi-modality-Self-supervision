AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. The ET tube tip is 5.7 cm above the carina. The left chest tube tip is in unchanged position. The left lower lung opacity concerning for atelectasis with overexpansion of the left upper lung is unchanged. Right lung is essentially unchanged including the right lower lobe opacity concerning for infectious process. Overall, no substantial change since the most recent prior radiograph has been demonstrated. The only difference is potentially minimal improvement of pulmonary edema, although currently the question is if there is no newly revealed right mid and lower lobe infectious process in place.
