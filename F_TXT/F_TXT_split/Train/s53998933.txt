In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a slightly better inspiration. There is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with left ventricular configuration. There may be minimal engorgement of pulmonary vessels. Opacification at the right base is consistent with small effusion and basilar atelectasis. There probably are also some atelectatic changes at the left base. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
