Lung volumes are low. Linear opacity projecting over the right mid lung likely represents atelectasis. The visualized portions of the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes appear normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this single view. Pulmonary vascular engorgement is noted. Pacing hardware appears similarly positioned compared to prior.
