As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The patient has also received a right central venous access line via the subclavian vein. The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip projects over the mid to lower SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Lung volumes have slightly decreased. As a consequence, the density of the lung parenchyma at both the right and the left lung base has slightly increased and more air bronchograms are seen than previously. Moderate cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax.
