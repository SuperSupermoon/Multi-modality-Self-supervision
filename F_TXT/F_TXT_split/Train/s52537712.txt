Patient is rotated considerably to the right. Given this, interval placement of endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm into the left upper quadrant, presumed terminating in the stomach, with side port at the level of the GE junction. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in patient position, with the cardiac silhouette enlarged. There is persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Vascular prominence appears stable to possibly minimally decreased. Chronic appearing left rib deformities are noted.
