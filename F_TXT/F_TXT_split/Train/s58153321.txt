Heart is normal in size, and cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis. The left hemidiaphragm is not visualized reflecting opacification of the left lower lobe, likely secondary to atelectasis, but in the appropriate clinical context pneumonia should be considered. Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
