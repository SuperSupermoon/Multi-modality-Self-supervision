Endotracheal tube terminates 1.5 cm above the carina. However, given kyphotic positioning and neck flexion it is likely at the lower limits of acceptable positioning it should not be advanced any further, but does not need to be withdrawn. Asymmetric pulmonary opacities, left greater than right, likely reflect a combination of edema and atelectasis. The costophrenic angles are not well assessed, though small right effusion is likely present. The heart size is moderately enlarged. Previously noted left basilar opacities persists.
