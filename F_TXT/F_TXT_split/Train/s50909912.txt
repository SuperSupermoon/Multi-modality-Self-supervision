As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone CABG. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.1 cm above the carina. The Swan-Ganz catheter, the hilar and mediastinal drains are in expected position. The nasogastric tube shows its tip projecting over the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced by approximately 5-10 cm. There is a minimal post-surgical pneumomediastinum but no evidence of pneumothorax. No larger pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema. No pneumonia.
