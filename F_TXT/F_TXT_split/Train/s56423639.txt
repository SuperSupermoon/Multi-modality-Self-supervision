Evidence of bilateral calcified pleural plaques are again seen, consistent with prior asbestos exposure. Prominence and indistinctness of the hila may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement/congestion. Patchy bilateral mid lung opacities may relate to pulmonary vascular congestion and overlying pleural plaques although underlying consolidation not excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. The lower left lateral hemithorax is not fully included on the image, however, difficult to exclude nondisplaced fractures involving the lateral left ___ and 8th ribs.
