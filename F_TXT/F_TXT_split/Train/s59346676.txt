As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a progression of disease. The previously subtle opacity at the left lung base is more extensive than before and now accompanied by an area of consolidation and a small left pleural effusion. In addition, there is increased radiodensity in the medial and basal aspects of the right lung, potentially reflecting a second infectious change. The findings might be exaggerated by leftward patient rotation, but should nevertheless be closely monitored. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
