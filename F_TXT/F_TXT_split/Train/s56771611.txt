The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The band-like area of atelectasis at the right lateral lung base is improved; however, there are worsening opacities in the bilateral retrocardiac areas. There is also blunting of the bilateral costophrenic sulci. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax.
