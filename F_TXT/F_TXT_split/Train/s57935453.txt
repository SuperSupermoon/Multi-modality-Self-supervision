1. Interval decrease in lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature but no evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia, pleural effusions, pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. There is fullness in the paratracheal region which may be vascular in etiology, although lymphadenopathy could also have this appearance. Followup imaging with improved inspiratory effort may be helpful to discern whether the right paratracheal fullness is related to vascular structures or represents a pathologic finding. A few linear streaky opacities in the left costophrenic angle likely reflects scarring or subsegmental atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Heart is upper limits of normal size given portable technique.
