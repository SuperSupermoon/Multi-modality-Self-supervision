As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has developed new bilateral interstitial opacities, the opacities are diffusely distributed in the lungs but are best seen at the level of the right upper lobe. The findings are highly suggestive for pneumonia, a viral origin or PCP should be strongly considered. No pleural effusions. Mild widening of the mediastinum, potentially suggestive of reactive adenopathy. No cardiomegaly. The left central access line has been removed.
