A left-sided PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The lung volumes are low with mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm that appears unchanged. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear stable including mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a persistent medial left basilar opacity with a rounded contour, suggesting a pleural-based mass concerning for malignancy. Smaller nodules are not well depicted on radiographs.
