As compared to the recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities have slightly improved, particularly in the left lung. A new elliptical opacity in the right mid lung could potentially be due to loculated intra fissure all fluid although a a coalescent region of airspace consolidation from either asymmetrical edema or infection is also possible. No other relevant changes.
