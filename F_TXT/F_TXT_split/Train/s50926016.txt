A single portable frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. There are widespread bilateral interstitial opacities, with a lower lung predominance, as well as subtle Kerley B lines and bilateral perihilar peribronchial cuffing. There is no focal consolidation. Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax. The heart is mildly enlarged. There is prominence of the azygos contour. Aortic calcifications are seen. Degenerative changes are seen at both glenohumeral joints.
