In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is more prominent and there is again evidence mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Hyperexpansion of the lungs is consistent with chronic pulmonary disease, though no definite acute focal pneumonia is appreciated. Prominence of the central pulmonary vessels suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension. There is soft tissue prominence of the right peritracheal region. This could merely represent tortuous brachiocephalic vessels, with the apparent increase related to a more oblique position of the patient.
