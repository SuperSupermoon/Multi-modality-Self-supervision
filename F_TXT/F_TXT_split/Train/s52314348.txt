New endotracheal tube is in standard placement, 5 cm above the carina. A new, temporary right internal jugular pacer tip projects over the right ventricle. Central consolidation in the right lung has increased dramatically, and there is little consolidation in the left lung, although there has been an increase in vascular congestion in the suprahilar left lung. Heart size is normal and any pleural effusion is minimal. If the right lung findings are due to pulmonary edema if it is extremely asymmetric. Therefore worsening pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage should be considered. There is no pneumothorax.
