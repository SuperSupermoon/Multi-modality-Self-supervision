AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the frontal view of the PA and lateral chest examination of ___. The degree of cardiac enlargement may have increased. However, portable and standard views can cause size distortion of the heart shadow. The midline row of sternal suture lines appears unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature has a degree of more perivascular haze in comparison with the previous study. In addition, lateral pleural sinuses are somewhat blunted suggesting the possibility of bilateral pleural effusion. Fortunately, no lateral view was obtained which could have given more conclusive information about the degree of pleural effusion in this patient who is probably beginning to develop failure. Observe that the portable chest examination cannot render details of intracardiac process. For that purpose, the next examination would be an echocardiogram.
