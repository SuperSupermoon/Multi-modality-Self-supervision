The exam is suboptimal due to underpenetration from patient body habitus. Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is again seen, which is likely due to mediastinal lipomatosis. Evaluation of the lung bases, particularly on the left, is suboptimal due to underpenetration and a small focal consolidation is difficult to exclude. No large pneumothorax. No definite pleural effusion, although small pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. There are low lung volumes with possible mild vascular congestion with vascular structures appearing similar to prior.
