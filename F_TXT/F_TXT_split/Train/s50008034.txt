IJ catheter tip is unchanged. Worsening pulmonary vascular congestion likely reflecting volume overload. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is notable for interval bulging of the left pulmonary outflow tract reflecting pulmonary arterial dilatation. This can be due to extensive vascular congestion and volume overload or perhaps embolic phenomena leading to acute increase in pulmonary pressures which needs to be correlated clinically. Heart size is top normal. No significant pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
