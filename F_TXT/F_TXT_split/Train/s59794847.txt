In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels again raises the possibility of some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Atelectatic changes are again seen at the bases. The dilated gas-filled stomach seen on the previous study is not definitely appreciated on this examination, though this may merely reflect that the upper abdomen is not well visualized.
