In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification at the right base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm. This is consistent with a layering pleural effusion and atelectasis. The change is especially pronounced given that the current study was taken upright while the previous was semi-erect. The left base is now clear. No evidence of vascular congestion. Right IJ catheter tip is in the region of the carina.
