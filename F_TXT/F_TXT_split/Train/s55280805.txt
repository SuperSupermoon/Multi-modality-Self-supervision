Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. There has been interval improvement in the diffuse bilateral heterogeneous airspace opacities. Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Nasogastric tube ends in the neo-esophagus. The endotracheal tube ends 4.3 cm from the carina. Right-sided PICC line is looped and coiled, and ends in the axilla. Right-sided Port-A-Cath ends at the distal SVC. No pneumothorax.
