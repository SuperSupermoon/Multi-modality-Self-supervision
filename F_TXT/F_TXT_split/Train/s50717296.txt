In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged, but no vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. Minimal opacification at the left base probably represents atelectatic changes. Large bore catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC. Extensive fixation hardware is seen about a previous fracture of the right proximal humerus.
