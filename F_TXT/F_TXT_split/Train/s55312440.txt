Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a Dobbhoff tube with the tip located within the proximal stomach. The tube should be advanced several centimeters more to put the tip more fully with the stomach. There is mild improvement in the pulmonary perivascular haze noted on previous exam. Otherwise, the chest radiograph remains essentially unchanged from previous imaging. There are no pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax or other complications seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
