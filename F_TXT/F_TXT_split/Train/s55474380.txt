In comparison with study of ___, the nasogastric tube and right IJ catheter have been removed. The right chest tube remains in place and there is a small pneumothorax, though somewhat larger than on the previous study. Subcutaneous gas is again seen along the right lateral chest wall. There is opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia could be considered.
