There is new right IJ which terminates in the distal SVC. New left subclavian line is seen abutting the mid SVC. The prior left IJ line is perhaps in a presistent SVC given its configuration, however is unchanged from prior radiographs. Existing right subclavian line is in unchanged position. Lung volumes are again low. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Vascular congestion is somewhat improved. Bilateral atelectasis as well as retrocardiac atelectasis is also somewhat improved.
