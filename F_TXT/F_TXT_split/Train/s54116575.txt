There is no definite focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Compared to the prior study, there is mild prominence of vascular markings likely reflecting mild pulmonary edema. Opacities at the bases are mostly unchanged and are most likely atelectasis. Again seen is a tortuous calcified aorta. The remainder of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. There are severe degenerative changes in the shoulders bilaterally and old rib fractures on the left. There is dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine.
