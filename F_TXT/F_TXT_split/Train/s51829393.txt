A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiac size. In the right lung base is increased opacity projecting over the inferior right heart border. An additional opacity projects over the left lung base. These could represent atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
