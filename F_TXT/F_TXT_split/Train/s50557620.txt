A chest tube is present on the left with the tip in the mid to upper lung field. Previously noted left pneumothorax has resolved. There is no pneumothorax on the right. There is a fracture of the left lateral fourth rib. There is diffuse interstitial and alveolar density bilaterally which may have a significant chronic component. There does appear to be increased upper zone vascular redistribution and blurring of vascular detail consistent with CHF.
