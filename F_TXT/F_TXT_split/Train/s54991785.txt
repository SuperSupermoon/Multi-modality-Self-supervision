The patient is status post interval endotracheal intubation. The endotracheal tube terminates about 3.5 cm above the carina. A new orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its distal course not imaged. The degree of opacification of the right hemithorax appears unchanged. However, there has been considerable interval clearance of opacification of the left lower hemithorax suggesting that much of the previously noted opacity was due to atelectasis. However, remaining bronchovascular opacities could represent bronchopneumonia versus residual atelectasis. There is no clear pleural effusion on the left on this examination. No pneumothorax is present.
