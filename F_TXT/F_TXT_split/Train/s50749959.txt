Endotracheal tube terminates 6.4 cm above the carina. A left-sided PICC is in stable position. Enteric tube descends below the field of view. Lung volumes are low, as before. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Bibasilar opacities are again demonstrated, not increased from the prior exam and are suggestive of atelectasis. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
