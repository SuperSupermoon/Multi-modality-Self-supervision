Right-sided pleural catheters remain in place. There is an elliptical opacity in the right mid lung which likely represents loculated fluid within the horizontal fissure. A more lobulated appearance to the right lateral pleura is also stable. No pulmonary edema is seen. The left lung is grossly clear. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
