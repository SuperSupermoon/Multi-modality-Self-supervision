In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a much better inspiration. There is generalized haziness of the right hemithorax, consistent with substantial pleural effusion. Less prominent effusion is seen on the left. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. Engorgement of pulmonary vessels is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion in a patient with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and intact midline sternal wires. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia can certainly not be excluded.
