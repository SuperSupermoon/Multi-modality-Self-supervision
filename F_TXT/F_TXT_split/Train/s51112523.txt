As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is less rotated. The hilar structures, right more than left, look enlarged, but no definitive mass is seen in the region of the right hilus. A small right pleural effusion might be present. There is mild fluid overload and a borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
