In comparison with the study of ___, the right chest tube has been removed. The opacification at the right base has somewhat increased, most likely representing some combination of free and loculated pleural effusion. Retrocardiac opacification could represent substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe or decreasing basilar hydro pneumothorax seen on previous radiographs. The right subclavian catheter is unchanged.
