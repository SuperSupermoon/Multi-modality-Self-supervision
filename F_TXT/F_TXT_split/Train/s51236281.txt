Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, except for re-positioning of a left PICC, with the tip now at or just below the cavoatrial junction. Low lung volumes limit assessment of the catheter as well as accentuate cardiomediastinal and bronchovascular structures. Allowing for this factor, cardiac silhouette is probably unchanged in size. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present, as well as apparent worsening of bilateral lower lobe opacities which probably represent atelectasis. Small right pleural effusion is present as well as a possible small left effusion, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
