In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some element of increased pulmonary venous pressure. Striking prominence of the central pulmonary vessels, consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with blunting of the costophrenic angle is consistent with some atelectatic changes with pleural effusion. Of incidental note is the fixation device in the proximal humerus.
