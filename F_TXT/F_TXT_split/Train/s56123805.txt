There is near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax, presumably by pleural effusion given the deviation of the trachea to the right. Underlying atelectasis is also likely, although a mass or consolidation should also be considered. A small area of aerated upper lung is all that remains. The right lung by comparison is nearly clear, although a small right pleural effusion is also probably present. Cardiac size is not possible to evaluate.
