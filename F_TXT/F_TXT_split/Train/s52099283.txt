AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality which worsened dramatically in the right lung between ___ and ___, already severe but worsened in the left lung simultaneously, first improved on ___ and has now worsened again. However, in the interim, the patient has been extubated, so much of the change is due to lower lung volumes. There is probably a combination of residual edema as well as aspiration pneumonia and adhesive atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Small left pleural effusion is larger. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are in their expected places. No pneumothorax.
