A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates lung volumes which are significantly decreased from prior radiograph. There is no definite pulmonary edema, and diffusely increased opacity may be secondary to vascular crowding. Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis and probable bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
