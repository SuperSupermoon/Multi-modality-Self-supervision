Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The ET tube tip is 4.2 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach, although the stomach is substantially distended. Heart size and mediastinum are grossly stable. Lungs are low in volumes with right middle lobe atelectasis, but overall there is no evidence of pneumothorax or increased pleural effusion.
