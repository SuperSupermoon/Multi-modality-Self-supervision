1. No significant interval change compared to the most recent prior exam performed at 8:53 p.m. on the same day. 2. Diffuse interstitial abnormality most pronounced at the bases.

While this could be related to enphysematous changes in the setting of hyperinflation, the possibility of a superimposed interstial process that has developed in the interim cannot be excluded. Moreover, a superimposed infectious process or superimposed CHF in an atypical distribution cannot be excluded. 3. 1.3-cm nodular density in the upper right lung for which a chest CT is recommended to evaluate for malignancy.
