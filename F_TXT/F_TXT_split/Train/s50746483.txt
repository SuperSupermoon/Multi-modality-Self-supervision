Heart size remains moderately enlarged but unchanged. Mediastinal contours are relatively stable. There is moderate pulmonary edema with perihilar alveolar opacities present, new from the prior. A moderate size right pleural effusion is increased in size compared to the prior exam. Small left pleural effusion is likely present. Bibasilar opacities, with more focal opacification in the right lung base, could reflect compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute bony findings.
