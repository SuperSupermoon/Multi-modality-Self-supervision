Pleurx catheter remains in place in the lower right hemithorax, and a moderate partially loculated right pleural effusion is again demonstrated. Although the basilar component appears improved, there is more fluid tracking at the right apex, and overall size of pleural effusion is probably similar when consideration is made of changes in distribution. Additionally, there is improving atelectasis in the right middle and right lower lobe. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by worsening edema. Small left pleural effusion is probably unchanged.
