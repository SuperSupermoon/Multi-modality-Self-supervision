A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained. In comparison to the prior examination, there is increased moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent dense opacification, likely representing compressive atelectasis, consolidation not excluded. Small left pleural effusion and adjacent mild atelectasis, increased. Multiple scattered pulmonary nodules, largest in the left upper lung, are relatively unchanged. Surgical clips in the left lower chest are again noted. A small well-rounded density projecting over the right scapula was not present on the prior study and could be external to the patient. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contour is otherwise unremarkable.
