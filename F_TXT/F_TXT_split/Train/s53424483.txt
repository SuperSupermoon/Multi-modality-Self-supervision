Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. A tracheostomy tube is again seen projecting over the superior mediastinum. The heart remains enlarged with central hilar engorgement raising concern for pulmonary vascular congestion. The lung volumes are low which limits the evaluation. There is no overt pulmonary edema or definite signs of pneumonia. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Imaged osseous structures are intact.
