AP chest compared to ___ and ___, 10:28 a.m. There has been relatively little change since ___, following insertion of left basal pleural drain, clearing most of the left pleural effusion and repositioning of the endotracheal tube, which improved severe atelectasis in the left lung, followed by extubation earlier in the day. Right upper lobe is still substantially consolidated, around a large central mass, appreciable consolidation at the base of the left lung, worsened earlier in the day and has not improved, presumably a function of extubation. Only a small residual left pleural effusion remains, basal pleural catheter still in place. No appreciable pneumothorax. Extensive heterogeneous consolidation and lung nodules in the aerated lobes conform to lesions, better demonstrated on CTA, ___. Left subclavian infusion port and right internal jugular line both end in the right atrium. Borderline cardiomegaly developed following extubation, subsequently unchanged.
