A single frontal image of the chest demonstrates a moderate-to-large left pleural effusion unchanged since previous imaging. A right lower lobe opacity is seen which is also unchanged since previous imaging. Pulmonary vessels are better defined and less engorged than on previous imaging, suggesting resolving interstitial edema. Again seen is significant cardiomegaly. A pacer is seen with leads following the expected course to the right atrium and right ventricle. Calcification of the pleura at the right lung base is consistent with asbestos exposure, and given the persistent left pleural effusion without known source, a possible mesothelioma would need to be ruled out.
