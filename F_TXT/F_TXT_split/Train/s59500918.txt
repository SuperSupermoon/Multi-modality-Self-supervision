Patient is status post gastrectomy and esophagojejunostomy, with anastomosis likely at the level of the diaphragm on review of the prior CT. The lungs are mostly clear. The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinum and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema, pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The tip of the nasogastric tube is difficult to ascertain, and possibly terminates in the lower chest or below the diaphragm. Dense radiopaque material in the shape of bowel loops is seen in the left upper quadrant and midline, likely from prior barium enema.
