A moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with lower lobe consolidation, which may represent atelectasis or pneumonia, is seen. The left heart border is obscured by this process. A small right pleural effusion is also seen. Indistinctness of the hilar markings is indicative of pulmonary edema. The upper mediastinal contour appears within normal range for size. There is no pneumothorax.
