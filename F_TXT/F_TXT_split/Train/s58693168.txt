Status post placement of permanent pacemarker with both pacing leads terminate to the left of midline, with the more distal lead in the expected location of the right ventricle. The prior CTA of the chest demonstrates baseline rotation and shift of the heart towards the left, causing the right atrium to project slightly to the left of midline, likely accounting for the location of the proximal lead on today's chest radiograph. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and the left hemidiaphragm is chronically mildly elevated. Blunting of left costophrenic sulcus appears to be due to a combination of cardiac enlargement and pericardial fat in this region as based on prior CTA of the chest. Exam is otherwise remarkable for 1.2 cm diameter opacity overlying the left third anterior rib level.
