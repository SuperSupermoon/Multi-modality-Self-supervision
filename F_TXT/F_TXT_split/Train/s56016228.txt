A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. The enteric catheter follows the right lateral course through the gastric neo-esophagus. The tip of the enteric catheter terminates at the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus. Esophagectomy staple line is unchanged. Right lower lobe scarring and right basilar atelectasis have slightly increased. A minimal right apical pneumothorax is present. The left lung is clear. No effusion is present. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
