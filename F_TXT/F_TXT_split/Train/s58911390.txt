As compared to the previous image, the patient has been extubated. The right internal jugular vein catheter remains in situ. The known rounded opacity on the right, presumably an old lung abscess, is unchanged in extent and severity. Also unchanged are the bilateral known fibrotic changes at the lung bases. No new focal parenchymal opacities, no pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
