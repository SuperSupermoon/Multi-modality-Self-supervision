As compared to the previous radiograph, the left lung shows minimally improved ventilation. However, there is still extensive cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and signs of moderate fluid overload. The asymmetry of the opacities at the lung bases suggests atelectasis rather than pneumonia. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position. No pneumothorax.
