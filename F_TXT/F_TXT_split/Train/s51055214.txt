Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Again seen left porta catheter, terminating in the right atrium. There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest pigtail catheter with interval significant decrease in left pleural effusion with possible only a small amount remaining. There has been significant interval decrease in left base opacity with mild haziness at the left base remaining, which may relate to underlying small pleural effusion and atelectasis, attention at followup. A new small left apical pneumothorax is seen. Right basilar opacity persists, likely due to pleural effusion and atelectasis with possible underlying consolidation.
