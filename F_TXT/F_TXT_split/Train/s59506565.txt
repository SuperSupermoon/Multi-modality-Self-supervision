AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Left chest tube is in place. Left PICC line tip terminates at the level of low SVC. There is small left apical pneumothorax that, when compared to the prior study, appears to be minimally decreased. Bibasilar consolidations associated with bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. There is potential present basal component of the left pneumothorax projecting as a lucency over the placement of the left pigtail catheter and that part might potentially be slightly worse as compared to prior study.
