Single portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates enteric feeding tube coursing midline with tip out of field of view and side port not fully evaluated. Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position 2.1 cm above the level of the carina. A break is again seen within the second sternotomy wire with additional sternotomy wires intact. A left IJ CVL tip terminates in the left brachiocephalic vein/SVC junction. Persistent small bilateral, right greater than left, pleural effusions with moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema is unchanged in appearance. No pneumothorax. Persistent mild cardiomegaly. Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
