Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates tracheostomy in place. There is a dense retrocardiac opacity and bilateral lung bases which could represent atelectasis. Patchy opacities in the left base likely represent atelectasis although infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits allowing for low lung volumes. Upper lungs are clear. Thoracic aorta is prominent and unfolded.
