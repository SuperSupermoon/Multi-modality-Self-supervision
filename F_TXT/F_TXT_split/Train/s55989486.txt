As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. In particular, the right lung base is better ventilated than on the previous image. There is no evidence of new parenchymal opacities in the lung parenchyma. No larger pleural effusions. Mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. The sternal wires are in unchanged normal alignment.
