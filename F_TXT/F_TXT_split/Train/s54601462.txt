An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.5 cm above the carina. The lung volumes are low, obscuring cardiac borders, although the heart is probably normal in size. There is moderate-to-severe elevation of the diaphragm with coinciding dilatation of the viscus in the left upper quadrant, probably the splenic flexure of the colon. A splenic shadow is not clearly visualized. Patchy left basilar opacity may be associated with atelectasis, but is not entirely specific or characterized here. In addition, there is mild diffuse interstitial abnormalities suggesting pulmonary edema. The patient has a leftward convex spinal curvature with fixation devices to the partly imaged and characterized along the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spines.
