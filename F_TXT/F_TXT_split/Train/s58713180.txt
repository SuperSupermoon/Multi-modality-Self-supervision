As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing tension pneumothorax is substantially improved. The pneumothorax is now without evidence of tension and of millimetric ___ at the lung apices. The monitoring and support devices, including the right chest tube, are in constant position. The severity and extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, diffusely distributed in both lungs, is unchanged.
