The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and left lower lobe atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is due to supine positioning and low lung volumes. Hila are unremarkable. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable without displaced rib fracture. Upper abdomen is within normal limits.
