An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position 4.5 cm above the carina. Right IJ central line tip overlies the SVC/ RA junction. No definite NG tube is identified. However, an NG tube may be faintly seen extending beyond the inferior edge of this film. An additional line or catheter overlies the upper abdomen in the midline, coursing from the right inferior to left superior to overlie the expected site of the gastric fundus. Thin wiring over the chest is also present --? residual lead. Again seen is moderately severe cardiomegaly, with prominence of the mediastinum. There is diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and patchy opacity at the right base similar to the prior film. The possibility of trace right pleural fluid cannot be excluded.
