As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal increase in transparency of the lung parenchyma, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. At the right lung base, however, a combination of pleural effusion and parenchymal opacity persists. These changes might be consistent with pneumonia. The changes have neither increased nor decreased in severity and extent as compared to the previous examination. A prexeisting retrocardiac atelectasis is less severe than on the previous image. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged course and position of a nasogastric tube.
