1. Left-sided pacemaker again identified with multiple leads seen, many of which terminate over the expected location of the right atrium and two of the leads terminate over the expected location of the right ventricle. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning and persistent low lung volumes. Lungs demonstrate streaky bibasilar opacities suggestive of subsegmental atelectasis, but no focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Linear opacity at the left base may represent scarring or subsegmental atelectasis. No pneumothorax or free air. Calcifications in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
