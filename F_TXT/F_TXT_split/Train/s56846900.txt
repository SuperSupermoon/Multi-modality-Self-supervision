Left basilar opacity is seen, which may be combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded. There is relatively low lung volume. Slight prominence of the hila is likely due to low lung volumes, although mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement is not excluded. No large right pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
