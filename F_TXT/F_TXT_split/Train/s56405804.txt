1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid-to-distal SVC. Endotracheal tube has its tip 3.2 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the superior vena cava. 2. Persistent diffuse airspace and interstitial abnormality with slight interval reduction in lung volumes. More focal airspace opacity at the left base may reflect either superimposed partial lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. Given the diffuse lung disease, it is difficult to assess the cardiac and mediastinal contours, especially in light of the marked patient rotation on the current examination.
