Single frontal upright chest radiograph demonstrates heterogeneous opacity within the right middle lobe with elevation of the right hemidiaphram consistent with right middle lobe atelectasis with crowding of vasculature. No additional focal opacities. The left lung is clear. No pleural effusion. Bilateral right greater than left hyperdense line along bilateral apices are consistent with bilateral pleural thickening. No pneumothorax. Heart size is top-normal. Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable.
