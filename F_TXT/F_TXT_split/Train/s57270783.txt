AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 5:02 a.m.: Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the thoracic inlet, approximately 5.5 cm from the carina, standard placement. Nasogastric tube is coiled in the stomach. Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC. The only focal pulmonary abnormality is consolidation obscuring the descending thoracic aorta and portion of the left hemidiaphragm. This could be atelectasis or developing pneumonia. There is no pulmonary edema, appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Evaluation of subtle chest cage, such as the thoracic vertebral burst fracture diagnosed by torso CT, is not reliably assessed by conventional chest radiography.
