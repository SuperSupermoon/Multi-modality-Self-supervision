Areas of increased opacification overlying the right lung. Could be postsurgical. Not of typical appearance for pneumonia, however given the significant underlying architectural distortion of the right lung this may represent an infectious process in the proper clinical setting. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
