In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular level, approximately 7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is now in place that extends to the upper stomach. The side hole is probably just distal to the esophagogastric junction. Little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Hazy opacification in the left mid-to-lower lung zone is consistent with layering pleural effusion.
