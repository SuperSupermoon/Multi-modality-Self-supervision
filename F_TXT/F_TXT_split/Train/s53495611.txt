The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable allowing for differences in technique. There is a vague rounded opacity projecting over the right lower lung, not clearly visualized on the recent prior study, although this may be due to differences in orientation of image acquisition. Peribronchial cuffing and interstitial thickening could be seen with mild vascular congestion or possibly other conditions such as airway inflammation or atypical infection. Regarding the focal right lower lung opacity, one concern is a possible mass. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
