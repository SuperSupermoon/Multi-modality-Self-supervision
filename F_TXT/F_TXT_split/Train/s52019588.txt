The heart is moderately enlarged. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Vascular indistinctness and right basilar haziness likely reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusions are small, right greater than left. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. More focal opacification in the right mid lung field could reflect fluid loculated within the fissure, but infection or an underlying mass lesion cannot be completely excluded. No pneumothorax is detected. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
