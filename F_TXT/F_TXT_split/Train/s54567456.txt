As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. There is unchanged evidence of several abnormal hilar and mediastinal contours, notably at the level of the left hilus and the right para- and retrocardiac lung areas. No pleural effusions. No pneumonia. However, is indicated in the previous report, the abnormalities described above required further evaluation by CT.
