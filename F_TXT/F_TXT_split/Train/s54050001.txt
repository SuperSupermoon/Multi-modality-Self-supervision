In comparison the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there has been substantial interval increase in large, right greater than left, bilateral pleural effusions. Inflated lung parenchyma appears grossly clear, but is incompletely evaluated due to the substantial pleural effusions. With the chin flexed, the ET tube is 1 cm above the carina. A Dobhoff tube is unchanged in position, terminating in the mid stomach. A right-sided port is unchanged in position.
