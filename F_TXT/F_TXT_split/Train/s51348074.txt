The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea. There has been interval placement of a gastric tube which extends below the level the diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph. Interval increasing perihilar and infrahilar airspace opacities, particular involving the right mid and lower lung zone. A small right pleural effusion is also new. These findings may reflect increasing pulmonary edema on a background of chronic lung disease. The size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.
