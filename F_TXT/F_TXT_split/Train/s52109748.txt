There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube ending approximately 3.4 cm above the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. A left pectoral pacemaker with dual leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle is unchanged. The lungs remain hyperinflated with flattening of the bilateral hemidiaphragms, compatible with COPD. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. There is no interval change in mild pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema. Streaky opacities in the bilateral bases likely reflect atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
