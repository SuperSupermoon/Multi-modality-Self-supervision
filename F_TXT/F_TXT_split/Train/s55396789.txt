AP chest compared to ___. Tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 6 cm from the carina. Chin is not included on this study and I do not know the position of the neck. Assuming the neck was not fully extended, the tube could safely be advanced 15 mm to obtain more secure seating. Left juxtahilar mass and mediastinal adenopathy are unchanged. Small right pleural effusion is new or newly apparent. There is no lobar collapse. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax.
