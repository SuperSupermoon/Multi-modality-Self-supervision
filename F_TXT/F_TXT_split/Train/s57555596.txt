Heart size is normal. Rim calcified convexity at the AP window is concerning for a pseudoaneurysm. The aorta is otherwise diffusely calcified. Hilar contours are unremarkable. Vascular indistinctness with perihilar haziness suggests mild pulmonary edema. Additional ill-defined nodular opacities are noted within the right lung, which could reflect infection or aspiration. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
