Again seen are multiple left-sided rib fractures. A previous-seen tiny left apical pneumothorax is now less apparent. The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours remain within normal limits. An ill-defined left basilar opacity subjacent to the rib fractures is now slightly more defined in comparison to prior examinations, possibly representing contusion.
