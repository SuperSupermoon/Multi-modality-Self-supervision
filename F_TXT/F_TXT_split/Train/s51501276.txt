Lung volumes are low, accounting for bronchovascular crowding. There is an ill-defined opacity in the left cardiophrenic angle, which appears to obscure the left inferior cardiac margin, new compared with exam performed four hours ago. No other focal opacities are identified. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
