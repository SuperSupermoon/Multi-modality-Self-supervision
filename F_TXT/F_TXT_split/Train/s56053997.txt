Right PICC terminates at the junction of the right subclavian and right brachiocephalic veins at the medial aspect of the right clavicle. Intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules appear similar to the prior study. Worsening partial atelectasis of the right lower lobe, with adjacent persistent right pleural effusion. Large right paraspinal mass is better demonstrated on recent CT.
