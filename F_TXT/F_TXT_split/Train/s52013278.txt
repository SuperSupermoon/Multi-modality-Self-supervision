Small left and moderate right pleural effusions are likely stable, given differences in positioning. The markedly aneurysmal tortuous aorta causing rightward tracheal deviation is unchanged in appearance. No pneumothorax. Upper lungs are clear with bibasilar atelectasis. Vertebral compression fractures are evident but better evaluated on prior CT examination.
