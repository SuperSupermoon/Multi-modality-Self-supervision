Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval removal of a right-sided Port-A-Cath and improvement in left pleural effusion and pleural fluid along the right horizontal fissure on the right. A hazy opacity projects over the peripheral left mid lung zone, which is likely due to post radiation changes. The heart size is stable and the lung volumes are persistently low, with bibasilar atelectasis. The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion is slightly improved since the prior study. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or subdiaphragmatic free air on this portable study.
