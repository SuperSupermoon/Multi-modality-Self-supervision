Heart size is moderately enlarged, which is likely unchanged when compared to the prior study when accounting for differences in technique. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is minimal pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present, and more focal opacity within the retrocardiac region may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
