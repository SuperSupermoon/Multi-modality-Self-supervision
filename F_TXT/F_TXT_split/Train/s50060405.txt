In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. There is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pulmonary opacifications most likely reflecting elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The right hemidiaphragm is no longer sharply seen, consistent with layering effusion and atelectasis at the right base. The left base again shows mild obscuration of the hemidiaphragm. In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
