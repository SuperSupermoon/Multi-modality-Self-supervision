Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier. Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm, likely the tip is in the stomach. The left lateral hemithorax was not included in the film. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There are low lung volumes.
