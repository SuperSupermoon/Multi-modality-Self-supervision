In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease, but no acute focal pneumonia. Continued blunting of the costophrenic angles with opacification at the left base, consistent with small pleural effusions and underlying atelectasis. No acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
