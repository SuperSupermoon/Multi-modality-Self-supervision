Endotracheal tube terminates 4.2 cm cranial to the carina in standard position. An upper enteric tube terminates in the mid-to-distal gastric body. Lung volumes are extremely low, exaggerating the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vasculature though compared to the earlier examination there appears to be mild volume overload. Heart size is likely normal. Lungs are clear taking into account low lung volumes. Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
