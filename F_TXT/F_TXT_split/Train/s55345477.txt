Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position, terminating approximately 4.6 cm from the carina. Enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm into the stomach and off the inferior borders of the film. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Bibasilar airspace opacities, more severe on the left, may reflect areas of atelectasis though aspiration or infection cannot be completely excluded. Small left pleural effusion also may be present. There is no pneumothorax. No pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated.
