Persistent bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar airspace disease, worsening on the left and stable on the right, most likely representing partial lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of effusions. Bibasilar pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. In addition, there is a stable left apical opacity. Persistent mild interstitial edema. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. Right tunneled pleural catheter crosses the mid line and is unchanged in position. Left upper extremity vascular stent again seen.
