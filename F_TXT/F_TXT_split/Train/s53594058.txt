Endotracheal tube ends 4.4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube follows the expected course to the stomach, although the tip is not in view. Left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Compared to the prior study, mild pulmonary edema has increased with increased azygous distention. Given the stable heart size and intracranial findings, this may be neurogenic. There are probably small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
