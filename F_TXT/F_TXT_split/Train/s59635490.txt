Heart remains enlarged which may reflect pericardial effusion or cardiomegaly. Clinical correlation is advised. The endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position with its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Mild perihilar edema is present. There are layering effusions with bibasilar patchy opacities, left greater than right, most likely reflecting compressive lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
