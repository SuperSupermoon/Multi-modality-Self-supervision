AP chest compared to ___: Small areas of residual consolidation in the right lower lobe have improved slowly since ___. There may be a small region of new consolidation just lateral to the right hilus, but the area is obscured by the anterior rib and I do not want to overestimate the likelihood of new pneumonia. Left lung is entirely clear. Tiny right pleural effusion is probably unchanged. Borderline cardiomegaly stable. Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Bilateral central venous lines end in the mid and low SVC respectively.
