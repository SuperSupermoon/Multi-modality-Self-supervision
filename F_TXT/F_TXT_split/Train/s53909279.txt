Again, there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with an unchanged opacity at the right base, and likely a small right pleural effusion. There is no right pneumothorax. There is an unchanged pigtail catheter overlying the left hemithorax. A new thin linear density along the left apex may represent a tiny apical pneumothorax. Alternatively, given that it was not definitely seen on prior exam, could represent a skin fold. This is no left consolidation or pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Surgical clips in the right upper abdomen are unchanged.
