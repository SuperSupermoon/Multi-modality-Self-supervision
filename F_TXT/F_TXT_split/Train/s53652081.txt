Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The NG tube tip is at the level of lower thoracic vertebral bodies in a patient who is after esophagectomy. Right chest tube is in place, unchanged as well as the right lower lung pigtail catheter. The epidural catheter is in place as well. There is no change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette, bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis although note is made that there is slight interval worsening of the right lower lung aeration in addition to the already compromised aeration of that part of the lung. The Port-A-Cath catheter inserted through the right subclavian approach terminates at the level of mid low SVC. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.
