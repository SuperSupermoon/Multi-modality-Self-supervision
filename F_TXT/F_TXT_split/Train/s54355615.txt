Endotracheal tube is noted with the tip terminating approximately 3.4 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube courses into the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the left upper quadrant. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are noted prominent within left, and may represent atelectasis versus aspiration. The upper lobes are clear bilaterally. There is no pneumothorax identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly within normal limits.
