Lung volumes are low though without confluent consolidation. Basilar linear opacities may be due to underinflation, though early pulmonary edema cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax. No vascular congestion or large pleural effusions are evident. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits without evidence of developing mediastinal hematoma. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. A known sternal fracture is not well evaluated on this single frontal chest radiograph.
