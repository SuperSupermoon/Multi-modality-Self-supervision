Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. Multiple scattered bilateral lung nodules are better evaluated on recent CT. Mildly increased opacity in the right lower lung surrounding the nodule is compatible with postprocedural change from transbronchial biopsy. There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. There is no pleural effusion or widening of the mediastinum.
