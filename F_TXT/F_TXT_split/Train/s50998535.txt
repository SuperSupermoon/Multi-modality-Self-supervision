1. Endotracheal tube has its tip 3.5 cm above the carina. A right subclavian central line has its tip in the distal SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. There are layering bilateral effusions with associated airspace opacity most likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. The pulmonary edema has slightly worsened. The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. Calcification in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. No evidence of pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
