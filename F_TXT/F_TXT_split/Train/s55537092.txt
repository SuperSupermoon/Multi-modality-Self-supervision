Dual lead left-sided AICD is again seen with leads unchanged in position. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with the cardiac silhouette enlarged and the aorta calcified. There is patchy right basilar opacity new since the prior study which could be due to infection or aspiration. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation, if/when patient able. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
