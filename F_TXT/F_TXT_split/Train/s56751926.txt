Compared with earlier the same day (7:29 a.m.), the ET tube has been removed. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A left IJ central line is seen, overlying the innominate vein, proximal to the confluence with the right subclavian vein. Prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette, left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and vascular blurring are again seen, unchanged. Probable small bilateral effusions. The right effusion is slightly more prominent.
