AP chest compared to ___: The roughly spherical air-containing structure at the right margin of the upper mediastinum, which has increased in caliber over the past two days, is presumably a portion of the neoesophagus. Postoperative right lung following lobe resections is well aerated. Left lung shows mild vascular engorgement but no edema, collapse or consolidation. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or detectable pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Patient has been extubated. Upper drainage tube passes to the level of the diaphragm. Subcutaneous emphysema in the right neck has probably migrated from the chest wall where it is still substantial.
