Previous unilateral pulmonary edema and atelectasis in the left upper lobe has largely cleared. Lower lobe still atelectatic. Moderate pleural effusions right greater than left unchanged. Full extent right lower lobe atelectasis is difficult to assess but the right upper lobe is clear. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Left pleural drain still in place, probably sharply folded, simulating a wire lobe projecting over the tip. ET tube is in standard placement, but the caliber is below half the diameter of the trachea an should be evaluated clinically for sizeappropriateness. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of a nondistended stomach. No pneumothorax. Left jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC.
