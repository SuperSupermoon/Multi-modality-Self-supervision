ET tube terminates approximately 2.8 cm above the carina. There is a right-sided IJ which terminates in the low SVC. An NG tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip in the body of the stomach. Opacity in the right lower lobe may be secondary to atelectasis vs. effusion. The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours aside from mild pulmonary vascular congestion are unremarkable. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
