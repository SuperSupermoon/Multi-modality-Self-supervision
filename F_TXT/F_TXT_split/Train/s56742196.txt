A single upright frontal image of the chest shows a large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. Underlying airspace disease in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded. Hazy opacification of the right base is likely atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The size of the cardiac silhouette is somewhat obscured by the effusion, but appears normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
