The lung volumes are low. The patient is intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3.6 cm above the carina. The patient has a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the proximal parts of the stomach. There is moderate cardiomegaly and evidence of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. In addition, blunting of the right costophrenic sinus is seen, likely suggesting the presence of a pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumonia.
