Portable AP chest radiograph shows a large caliber pigtail catheter projected over the left lung base which appears repositioned/unkinked compared to yesterday's study. There is no more, and perhaps less, pleural fluid density on the left with some apparent loculation supralaterally. The medial left hemidiaphragm remains obscured. Baseline cardiomegaly is unchanged. Calcified atherosclerotic plaque is seen in the arch of the thoracic aorta.
