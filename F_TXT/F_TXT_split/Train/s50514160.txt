Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature is suggestive of mild-to-moderate increase in central pulmonary venous pressure. Bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right, are likely present. Bilateral atelectatic changes, left greater than right, and an overlying pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration, must be excluded in the proper clinical setting. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Post-surgical changes are noted with median sternotomy wires and surgical clips.
