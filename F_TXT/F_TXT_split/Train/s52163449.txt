As compared to yesterday's radiograph, there is minimal improvement in radiolucency of the known right predominant parenchymal opacity. However, the extent of the opacity is still very severe. On the left, the lung remains relatively transparent, with exception of a small retrocardiac atelectasis. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Unchanged position and course of the monitoring and support devices.
