ET tube tip lies approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Left IJ central line tip overlies the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Slightly rotated positioning. Allowing for this, cardiomediastinal enlargement appears similar to prior. The patient has a known ascending aortic aneurysm. Sternotomy wires again seen. The patient has mitral and tricuspid valve replacements. There are extensive opacities throughout both lungs. This appears to reflect the presence of CHF with interstitial and alveolar edema, however, the presence of background infectious infiltrates would be difficult to exclude in this setting. There is persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a probable small left effusion, similar to prior. Previously seen small right effusion is less apparent on this exam, though could still be present.
