Enteric tube terminates in left upper quadrant. Right PICC line terminates in the mid SVC. Diffuse parenchymal opacities and bilateral pleural effusions are similar. Increased opacification of the right lateral lung is likely a function of different orientation of the pleural fluid. Mild superimposed edema persists. Heart size is stable.
