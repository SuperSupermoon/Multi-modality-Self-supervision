AP chest reviewed without benefit of prior chest imaging. Lung volumes are low, exaggerating a bilateral infrahilar parenchymal abnormality which I suspect is atelectasis. Nevertheless, the hila are both abnormal, probably due to dilated arteries, but I cannot be sure there is no adenopathy. The infrahilar consolidation could be simple atelectasis or something more substantial. There is some anatomic disorganization to these lungs despite low lung volumes, which suggests either bronchiectasis or emphysema. The heart is not enlarged and there is no pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion. Prior chest imaging, conventional chest radiographs and ultimately chest CT may be necessary to sort out these findings.
