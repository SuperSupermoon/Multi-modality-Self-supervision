Single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates stable right pleural effusion with ovoid opacity projecting over mid lung likely representing loculated pleural fluid within the fissure. Unchanged right basilar opacification likely reflects atelectasis given chronicity though cannot exclude superimposed infectious process. Increased central pulmonary vascular engorgement suggesting pulmonary edema. Increased nodular opacifications within the right upper lung may represent multifocal infectious process possibly aspiration though assymetric pulmonary edema is a consideration. Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable. Redemonstration of esophageal stent in stable position. Left Port-A-Cath terminates within the right atrium.
