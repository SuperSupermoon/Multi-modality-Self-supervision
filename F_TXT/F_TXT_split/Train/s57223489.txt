There are persistent bilateral pleural effusions, decreased somewhat in size compared to the prior study. Persistent bibasilar atelectasis. Reticular opacities throughout the lungs likely reflect interstitial edema with alveolar edema evident at the lung bases. No pneumothorax seen. The visualized bony structures demonstrate increased sclerosis consistent with metastatic disease. No free air under the diaphragm.
