Lung volumes remain low. There are patchy bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, likely representing partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. There is a layering right effusion. Mild crowding of the vasculature is seen, but no overt pulmonary edema is evident. Overall cardiac size is stable. There is stable widening of the mediastinal and hilar contours in this patient with known lymphadenopathy as documented on recent chest CT of ___. No pneumothorax.
