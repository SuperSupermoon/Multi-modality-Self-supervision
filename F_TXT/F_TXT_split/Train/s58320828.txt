There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous line, with the tip terminating in the low SVC. Apparent kink seen in the line in the expected region of insertion in the neck. Lung volumes remain low resulting in bronchovascular crowding. There is a new band-like opacity within the right mid lung which is consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. Bibasilar opacities are likely due to atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Central pulmonary vascular congestion persists, though no overt edema is identified. There is no large pleural effusion. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.
