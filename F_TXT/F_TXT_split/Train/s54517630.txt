1. Interval placement of a left mainstem bronchial stent which appears to be in satisfactory position. Multiple bilateral pulmonary known metastatic lesions with a more dominant mass in the left upper lobe appear unchanged. However, there has been interval appearance of perihilar fullness and indistinct interstitium suggesting superimposed mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen. The aorta remains unfolded and tortuous. A linear lucency projecting in the left superior mediastinum, is felt to most likely correspond to the border of the trachea given marked patient rotation, although trace pneumomediastinum cannot be entirely excluded. This can be further assessed on followup imaging. Heart remains upper limits of normal size.
