There has been some interval re-expansion of the the right lower lobe, although it remains consolidative with alveolar edema. The left lower lobe is still completely collapsed. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are not significantly changed since the prior study. The thoracic aorta is tortuous with calcifications at the arch. Mild pulmonary edema is also present. Cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate. A left upper extremity PICC terminates at the mid to lower SVC. The tip of the enteric tube is not clearly identified. Spinal fusion hardware is noted.
