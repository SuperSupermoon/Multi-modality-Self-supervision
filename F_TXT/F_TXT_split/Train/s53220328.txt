All lines, tubes, and support devices are unchanged in positioning. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is increasing opacification within the right upper lung, which likely represents pneumonia, although this area is difficult to evaluate due to overlying devices. The size of the bilateral pleural effusions is essentially unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
