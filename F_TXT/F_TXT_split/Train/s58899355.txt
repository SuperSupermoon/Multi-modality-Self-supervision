Study is slightly limited by patient rotation. Heart size is normal. Dense mitral annular calcifications are re- demonstrated. The aorta remains tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There is minimal atelectasis in the left lung base. Rim calcified structure in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen is compatible with a calcified gallstone.
