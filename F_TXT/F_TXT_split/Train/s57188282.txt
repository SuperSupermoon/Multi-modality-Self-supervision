Single frontal views of the chest were obtained. There are relatively low lung volumes that accentuated the bronchovascular markings. There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle with opacity at the left costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissue and trace pleural effusion, although small consolidation is not excluded. No consolidation is seen on the right. There is no pneumothorax or right pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
