Slightly rotated positioning. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.4 cm above the carina. An NG tube an NG type tube is present, tip overlying the gastric fundus, beneath the diaphragm. An IABP is present, extending from an inferior approach. The aortic knob itself is not well-defined, but the radiopaque tip probably lies at or immediately below the lower edge of the aortic knob. There are dense, confluent opacities in both upper zones, extending into the mid/ lower zones, but with sparing of both lung bases. The degree of confluence is greater on the left. No effusion is identified. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is at the upper limits of normal, but not frankly enlarged. No pneumothorax is detected.
