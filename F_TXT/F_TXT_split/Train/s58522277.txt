Portable AP upright radiograph demonstrates bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions, which appear stable in extent when compared to prior study. Streaky opacity within the right lower lung zone appears minimally more conspicuous which may reflect atelectasis or alternatively developing pneumonia. A right PICC is seen terminating in unchanged position at the cavoatrial junction. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
