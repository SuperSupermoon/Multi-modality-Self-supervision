In comparison with study of ___, there is now a tracheostomy tube in place. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. There is some increasing opacification at the right base. This most likely reflects a combination of layering effusion and atelectasis. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Less prominent opacification at the left base most likely represents atelectasis, though again infection would have to be considered. There is some increased indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent with some increasing pulmonary venous pressure.
