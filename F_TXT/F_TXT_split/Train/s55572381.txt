Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube terminating approximately 4 cm above the carina. An enteric tube courses inferiorly out of view, into the stomach. The heart is normal in size. There is a large right hilar mass measuring at least 6.5 x 5.3 cm with plate like perifissural opacity in the right upper lobe, suggestive of post obstructive volume loss. Alternatively, supervening infection and or aspiration cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Trace left basilar atelectasis is present. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No displaced osseous injury is evident.
