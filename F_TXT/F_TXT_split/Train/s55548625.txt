1. Worsening moderate-to-large right pleural effusion with associated consolidation in the right mid and lower lung likely representing compressive atelectasis although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. Given the contour of the right effusion, this suggests that at least a portion of the effusion is loculated. Left mid lateral opacity overlying the left eighth posterolateral rib likely reflects callus formation related to a remote fracture. Left lung is grossly clear. The vasculature appears to be cephalized, but this may be related to supine technique. No overt pulmonary edema. No large left effusion. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the diffuse process within the right hemithorax. No large pneumothorax is seen although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
