Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions and severe left lower lobe atelectasis. Previously seen possible left upper lobe opacity is no longer seen and likely due to overlying tubing on prior study. No pneumothorax. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. ET tube ends 5.6 cm from the carina, unchanged. Enteric tube ends off the imaged portion. Right internal jugular sheath ends just above the origin of the SVC, unchanged.
