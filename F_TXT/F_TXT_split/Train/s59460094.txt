Again seen is the right paratracheal opacity known to represent patient's right thyroid lobe goiter with leftward mass effect on the trachea, which appears narrowed. There are relatively low lung volumes with prominence of the bronchovascular markings. Slight prominence of interstitial markings may be due to mild pulmonary edema. Relative medial right lung base opacity may be due to confluence of vascular shadows, although in the appropriate clinical setting infectious process cannot be excluded. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation if/when patient is able. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
