There are no prior chest radiographs available for review. Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the thoracic inlet, no less than 6 cm from the carina with the chin flexed. This is too high. It should be advanced 3 cm for more secure positioning when the chin is elevated to neutral position or extension. Cardiomegaly is moderate. Lungs are clear. No pulmonary edema pleural effusion.
