Comparison is made with prior study ___. ET tube is straighter with no kinks and is in the standard position with tip 3.5 cm above the carina. The enteric tubes are outside the field of view below the diaphragm. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. Left lower lobe atelectasis has increased. Small left effusion is probably unchanged. Right lower lobe atelectasis is stable. Mild vascular congestion is stable. There is no evident pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes. Cardiac size is top normal.
