Right pigtail pleural catheter is similar in position to the prior radiograph. Again demonstrated is a moderate-sized partially loculated right pleural effusion, with a loculated hydropneumothorax component laterally. The latter has slightly increased compared to prior study. Exam is otherwise unchanged.
