Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with atherosclerotic calcifications noted within the descending aorta. Multiple clips are again noted about the right hilum compatible with prior lobectomy. Calcified pleural plaques are again seen bilaterally. Lungs remain hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again seen. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are re- demonstrated. Moderate pulmonary edema appears worse in the interval. No pneumothorax is detected. Patchy opacity in the left lung base may reflect an area of atelectasis. Rib deformities on the right likely reflect postoperative changes.
