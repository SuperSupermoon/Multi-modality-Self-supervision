There is new right-sided chest tube. There is a small right lateral pneumothorax. The right-sided PICC line tip is not well seen due to overlapping the spine but is probably at the SVC distally. There is increased volume loss of the right upper lobe, such that the inferior portion of the right upper lobe infiltrate is now located higher in the chest. The pleural-based abnormality on the right is again visualized and not substantially changed and is better characterized on the recent CT. The lungs demonstrate cephalization of the vessels with hazy alveolar infiltrate suggesting fluid overload.
