Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch are present, and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is slightly improved in the interval. Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect atelectasis, and there are likely trace bilateral pleural effusions, not changed from prior. No pneumothorax is detected. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
