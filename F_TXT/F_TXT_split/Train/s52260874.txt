CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. No endotracheal to is seen at this time. Compared with one day earlier, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed. There are low inspiratory volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but likely accentuated by portable AP technique and low lung volumes. Doubt overt CHF. No effusion. Some patchy retrocardiac opacity is present and could represent atelectasis related to low lung volumes. Otherwise, no focal opacities.
