As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. Pre-existing areas of atelectasis and small pleural effusions at the lung bases have completely resolved. A platelike atelectasis remains visible at the left lung base. There is a known rounded perihilar opacity on the left that is completely unchanged. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild elongation of the descending aorta.
