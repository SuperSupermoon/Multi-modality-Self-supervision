An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.4 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm to overlie the expected site of the gastric fundus. Right IJ central line tip overlies the distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for technical differences. The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated compared to the left. There is mild vascular plethora and slight blurring, which is probably not significantly changed allowing for technique. There is subsegmental atelectasis at the left and right bases, similar to the prior study. Probable small left effusion.
