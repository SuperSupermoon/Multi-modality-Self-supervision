Interval change in position of a right pigtail pleural catheter, with the initial bend or coiled portion of the distal tip now projecting lateral to the lower right rib cage suggesting that may be partially external to the pleural space. Decrease in size of loculated right pleural fluid collections with residual moderate partially loculated right pleural effusion remaining, as well as a small lateral loculated hydropneumothorax component. Adjacent areas of atelectasis are again demonstrated, particularly in the right mid and lower lung regions. Within the left lung, new patchy and linear left lower lobe opacities probably represent atelectasis. There is no evidence of left pleural effusion or left pneumothorax.
