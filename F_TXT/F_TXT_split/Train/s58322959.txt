As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has a minimal increase in the size of the cardiac silhouette. The pre-existing left pleural effusion has slightly increased and leads to retrocardiac atelectasis. On the right, a pleural effusion has newly occurred. In the well ventilated lung areas, there is no evidence of pathological opacities suggesting pneumonia.
