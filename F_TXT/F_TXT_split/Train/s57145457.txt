Rotated positioning. ET tube tip lies approximately 5.6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip extends beneath the diaphragm off the film. Again seen is complete opacification of the right lung, with a small residual aerated locule seen again seen centrally. There is increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion and a more focal opacity in left lung laterally, both similar to prior. The aerated left upper zone suggests some interval improvement in vascular plethora.
