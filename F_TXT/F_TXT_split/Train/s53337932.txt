Extremely heterogeneous pulmonary consolidation most severe in the right lower lobe and left apex and right upper lobe. Although some of the abnormality could be due to pulmonary edema, widespread infection is more likely, perhaps with concurrent pulmonary hemorrhage. Heart is normal size and mediastinal veins are not engorged. Small right pleural effusion is likely. No pneumothorax. Left jugular catheter ends at the cavoatrial junction. Right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.
