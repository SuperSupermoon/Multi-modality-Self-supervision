AP supine portable view of the chest was obtained. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Linear lucency projecting over the right humeral head extending to project over the right glenoid is felt to be artifactual.
