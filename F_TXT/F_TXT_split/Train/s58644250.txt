There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter with the tip terminating in the left brachiocephalic vein near the confluence with the SVC. The course of the line is unremarkable. No pneumothorax is detected. A right subclavian approach Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the low SVC at the cavoatrial junction. Coiled tubing overlying the left hemithorax is consistent with the patient's known shunt. An orogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. A lateral spinal fusion device is again noted. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is incompletely evaluated due to poor patient positioning but overall appears unchanged from the most recent prior study. No large pleural effusion or focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia is detected.
