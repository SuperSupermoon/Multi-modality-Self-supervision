AP chest compared to ___: Moderate cardiomegaly has progressed. Mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature is still engorged. Patient is on the verge of interstitial edema, but abnormality in the lungs is exaggerated by exceedingly low lung volumes. Small left pleural effusion and left basal atelectasis are presumed. No pneumothorax. Tip of the endotracheal tube is below the upper margin of the clavicles, and could be less than 2 cm from the carina. With the chin and neck extended, there is a risk of unilateral intubation unless the tube was withdrawn 15 mm. Left subclavian line ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax.
