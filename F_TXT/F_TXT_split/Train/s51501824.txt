The endotracheal tube terminates 5.5 cm above the carina, positioned above the level of the clavicular heads. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach, tip not well seen due to underpenetration. There is a left subclavian central line, which extends to the upper SVC. Lung volumes are low. There is resultant basal atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding. Heart size is stable. There is a left pleural effusion layering posteriorly and causing diffuse increased opacity of the left hemithorax. There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature, with perihilar haziness compatible with pulmonary edema. There is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.
