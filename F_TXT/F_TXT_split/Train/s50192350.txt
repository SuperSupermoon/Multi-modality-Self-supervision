Single upright AP view of the chest demonstrates interval removal of a dual-lumen hemodialysis catheter since the prior study. The lungs are well expanded, with a linear area of atelectasis in the left lower lung, but no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
