Single portable view of the chest. Endotracheal tube is seen with tip 4 cm from the carina. Enteric tube passes below the inferior field of view noting that side port is likely in the region of the GE junction are potentially just inferior to it. Increased interstitial markings seen throughout the lungs could be due to interstitial edema or chronic underlying interstitial disease. The hemidiaphragms are not well seen but this is likely due to positioning noting effusions cannot be entirely excluded. The cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged for technique.
