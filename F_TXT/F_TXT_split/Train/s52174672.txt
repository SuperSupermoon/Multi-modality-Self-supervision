There is a nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified but likely within the stomach. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal limits given patient rotation and portable technique. Streaky opacities at the right base may reflect patchy atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Stable underlying emphysema as there is a suggestion of cystic changes in both apices. No pneumothorax. No large effusions.
