Right apical pneumothorax is seen with no sign of tension. Right chest tube is unchanged in position from previous radiograph. The lung volumes are decreased in size with bilateral atelectatic changes, unable to rule out right middle lobe collapse. The cardiac silhouette is increased in size likely secondary to poor inspiration. Since the prior radiograph, the ET tube and nasogastric line has been removed. Left-sided PICC line with tip is unchanged in position in the midline.
