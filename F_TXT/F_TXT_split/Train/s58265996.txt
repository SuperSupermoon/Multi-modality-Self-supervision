In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again are bibasilar opacifications with poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with areas of atelectasis and pleural fluid that is more prominent on the left. No evidence of pneumoperitoneum. However, this is not an upright view. If there is serious clinical concern for free intraperitoneal gas, a true upright view should be obtained or the patient taken for CT examination.
