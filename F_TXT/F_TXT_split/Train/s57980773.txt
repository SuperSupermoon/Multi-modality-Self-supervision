Small right apical pneumothorax is slightly increased compared to the prior study, with visceral apical pleural line now just above the right fourth posterior rib level. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Worsening right juxtahilar and basilar consolidation as well as persistent left lower lobe atelectasis and/or consolidation, the latter accompanied by a moderate pleural effusion. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Right lower lobes septal thickening may reflect interstitial edema, possibly on the basis of reexpansion given recent right sided thoracentesis.
