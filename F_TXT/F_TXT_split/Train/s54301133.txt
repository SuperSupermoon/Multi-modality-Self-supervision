Lung volumes are decreased from prior exam. There are increased interstitial markings consistent with increased mild pulmonary edema. There is increased opacity in the left lung base, which may reflect atelectasis, pneumonia, or aspiration and possibly an element of pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. A right-sided central line is again seen terminating in the right atrium. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is severely enlarged, similar to prior exam.
