Single AP view of the chest was obtained. There lung volumes are low. Allowing for this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected Linear opacities in the right base are likely atelectasis. The heart appears mildly enlarged and the aorta is unfolded and calcified. Note is made of slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, but the imaged upper abdomen is otherwise unremarkable.
