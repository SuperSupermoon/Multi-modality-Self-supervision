Tip of endotracheal tube is in standard position, terminating 4.9 cm above the carina. Overlying the distal aspect of the endotracheal tube at the level of the thoracic inlet is a 1.4-cm diameter radiopaque structure that could potentially represent a dislodged tooth, particularly if the intubation was difficult or traumatic. This finding has been communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ on ___ at 10:25 a.m. at the time of discovery. Other indwelling devices are unchanged in position, cardiomediastinal contours are stable, and small-to-moderate layering right pleural effusion with adjacent right basilar atelectasis is unchanged.
