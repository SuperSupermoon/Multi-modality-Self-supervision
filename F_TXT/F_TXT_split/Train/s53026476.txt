Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is an intra-aortic balloon pump whose tip is just below the aortic knob, stable since the previous study. There has been removal of a central venous catheter within the left pulmonary artery entering from an inferior approach since the previous study. Endotracheal tube and feeding tube are stable. The heart size is enlarged, but stable. There is prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. There is a left retrocardiac opacity which is unchanged. There are no pneumothoraces.
