As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change has occurred in the position of the slightly-malpositioned nasogastric tube. At the level of the gastroesophageal junction, the tube is still kinked in the esophagus and requires repositioning. The appearance of the lungs and of the cardiac silhouette demonstrate no relevant change.
