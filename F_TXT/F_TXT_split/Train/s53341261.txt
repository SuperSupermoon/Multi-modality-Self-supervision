A right internal jugular catheter is present with the tip in the upper SVC. A left-sided chest tube is in unchanged position. Sternal wires are intact. Since the prior exam, the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been removed. The lung volumes are lower, accentuating the bronchovascular structures and pleural effusions. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are likely just slightly increased in szie. There is associated atelectasis. The apices of lungs are clear. The mediastinal contours are unchanged, with an expected postoperative appearance. The cardiac size is difficult to evaluate given the adjacent effusions.
