The right IJ central line terminates in the mid to distal SVC, unchanged in position. The tracheostomy tube appears unchanged in position. There is persistent leftward mediastinal shift. The left heart border is also obscured consistent with atelectasis of the lingula. The left basilar opacity has increased consistent with worsening atelectasis and pleural effusion. There may be a small right pleural effusion as well.
