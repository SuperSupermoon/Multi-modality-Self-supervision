There are diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities, right worse than left. Blunting of the lateral costophrenic angles is noted, potentially in part due to overlying soft tissues although small effusions are possible. Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess on background of parenchymal opacities. Right chest wall port is seen with catheter tip projecting over the lower SVC.
