Compared to yesterday's examination, there is slight increase of interstitial lung markings compatible with minimally increased pulmonary edema. A left-sided PICC now terminates at the level of the lower SVC. There is otherwise no significant change compared to yesterday's examination with redemonstration of large bilateral hilar masses, a patent-appearing left mainstem bronchial stent as well as retrocardiac atelectasis. Persistent asymmetric opacification of the left lung is of unclear etiology.
