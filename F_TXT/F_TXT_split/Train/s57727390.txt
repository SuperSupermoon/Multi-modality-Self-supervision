The patient is status post esophagogastrectomy procedure. Nasogastric tube remains in place within the neoesophagus, and post-operative alterations of the right mediastinal contour appear similar. Moderate right pleural effusion appears slightly more prominent, but positional differences between the studies limit comparison. Right basilar atelectasis is unchanged, but linear left basilar atelectasis has slightly worsened.
