1. Markedly low lung volumes persist with interval removal of the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. Right internal jugular central line and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position. Although there is crowding of the vasculature, there now is a component of mild perihilar and interstitial edema. There is also patchy bibasilar opacity likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. The patient's mandible obscures the apices. No large pneumothorax is seen. Probable layering left effusion.
