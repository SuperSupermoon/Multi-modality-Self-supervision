There are confluent bibasilar opacities due to a combination of right pleural effusion bilateral consolidations suspicious for infection and probable atelectasis. Given differences in technique, there has been no dramatic interval change. Tracheostomy tube is noted. Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes are also visualized. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Right-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter tip is within the right atrium. Right PICC tip is also likely in the upper right atrium
