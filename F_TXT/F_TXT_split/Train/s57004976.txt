As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line has been pulled back. The line now projects over the lower SVC. There is no evidence of complications, not notably no pneumothorax. The patient is rotated and the lung volumes have decreased. Small areas of atelectasis at the left lung bases are constant. There is now minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially associated with a small left pleural effusion. No new parenchymal opacities. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
