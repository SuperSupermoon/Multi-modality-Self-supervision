A new right-sided central line is present, ending in the lower SVC. There is no evidence of right-sided pneumothorax. There is also a new nasogastric tube which ends PG on the gastroesophageal junction, with the tip out of view. The endotracheal tube is seen appropriate position, unchanged from prior, 3 cm above the carina. Otherwise there is no significant change compared with radiographs performed 3 hr prior, with large confluent consolidations in the right lung, patchy diffuse consolidations in the left lung, moderate to severe cardiomegaly, and small left-sided pleural effusion.
