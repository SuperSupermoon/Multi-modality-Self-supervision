Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. No endotracheal tube is seen. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which may be due to slight pleural thickening and overlying soft tissues. There are relatively low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. No frank consolidation is seen. There is no pneumothorax. Cervical hardware is seen. No displaced fracture is identified.
