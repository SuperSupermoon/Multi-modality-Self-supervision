In comparison with the study of ___, the Dobbhoff tube has been removed. Nasogastric tube coils in the fundus of the stomach with the tip pointing downward. Substantial opacifications are again seen bilaterally, consistent with large effusions, worse on the right, and bilateral compressive atelectasis. Pulmonary vascularity is somewhat difficult to assess. There is dilatation of loops of bowel within the abdomen. In the absence of a true upright image, it is impossible to exclude free intraperitoneal gas.
