Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There are bilateral small pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. There is cephalization of the vessels consistent with mild vascular congestion, without frank pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours have the expected post-operative appearance. There is no pneumothorax. The right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the mid to distal SVC.
