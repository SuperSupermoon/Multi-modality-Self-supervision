A tracheostomy tube is seen midline and a right-sided PICC line terminates at the mid to distal SVC. Orogastric tube in seen coursing below the diaphragm, the tip is not included in this examination. As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, lung volumes remain low and there has been slight improvement of right basilar opacity. Retrocardiac opacity persists and there are probable persistent bilateral pleural effusions. An underlying infectious process however cannot be excluded. An area of linear atelectasis is now seen at the right lung base. Moderate pulmonary edema persists. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
