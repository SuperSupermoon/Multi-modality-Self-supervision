Endotracheal tube now terminates approximately 1.8 cm above the level of the carina, could be withdrawn by 1-2 cm. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the stomach. The lungs are relatively hyperinflated. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable. Streaky left base retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is seen.
