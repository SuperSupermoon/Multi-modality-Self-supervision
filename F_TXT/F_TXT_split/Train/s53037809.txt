As compared to the previous image, the endotracheal tube has been pulled back. The tip of the tube now projects approximately 4 cm above the carinal. The course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged. Pre-existing very subtle parenchymal opacities at the level of the right than left lung base are no longer visualized.
