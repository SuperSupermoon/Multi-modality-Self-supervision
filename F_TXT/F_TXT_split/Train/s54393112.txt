Two left-sided chest tubes remain in place. Interval increase in size of a moderate, partially loculated left pleural effusion with apparent slight decrease in size of loculated left basilar pneumothorax. Worsening subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall. Worsening left mid and lower lung opacities which likely represent atelectasis. Within the right lung, a cluster of poorly defined nodules in the right mid lung region are of uncertain chronicity but correspond to a tree-in-___ pattern of nodules on outside chest CT of ___, which also demonstrates several well-defined nodules as well. Correlation with results of the outside CT is recommended.
