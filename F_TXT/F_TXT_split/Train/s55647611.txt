As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Right pleural effusion with subsequent atelectasis at the right lung bases. Left small pleural effusion with retrocardiac atelectasis. Both findings are unchanged as compared to the previous image. A minimal increase in radiodensity in the right upper lobe is due to positional factors. The monitoring and support devices are constant. Constant low lung volumes without overt pulmonary edema.
