The heart is severely enlarged and has increased in size compared to the prior study. There continues to be pulmonary vascular redistribution but there is an increase in alveolar infiltrate, right greater than left, which is also increased compared to prior. There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions. The overall impression is that of CHF which has worsened in the interval.
