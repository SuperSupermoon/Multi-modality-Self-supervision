Lung volumes are exceedingly low. The diaphragm is severely elevated, particular the right. Bibasilar atelectasis is presumed. On the left, I cannot exclude concurrent pneumonia as well as a small pleural effusion. However hypoxia is best explained by extremely low lung volumes. The heart is at least mildly enlarged but there is no pulmonary edema, and no pneumothorax.
