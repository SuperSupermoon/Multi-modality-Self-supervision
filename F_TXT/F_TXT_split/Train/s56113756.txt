CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. The tracheostomy tube is in place. There are low inspiratory volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. No gross effusion. Possible minimal upper zone redistribution, but doubt overt CHF. No right-sided infiltrate or effusion is identified. Compared with ___ at 11:05 a.m., changes at the left base are similar, but slightly worse.
