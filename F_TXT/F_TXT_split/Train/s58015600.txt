Single supine portable view of the chest. Right PICC is no longer seen. There is progression of the right basilar opacity which silhouettes the hemidiaphragm. The left lung is grossly clear as is the right upper lung. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta. Again seen. Impression: Right basilar opacities silhouetting the hemidiaphragm compatible with component of pleural effusion. Underlying atelectasis and possible infection is also possible.
