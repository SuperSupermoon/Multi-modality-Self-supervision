Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion or focal consolidation, however there is some mild interval increase in air bronchograms seen in the right lung base. This study demonstrates unchanged position of the endotracheal tube which ends 2 cm above the carina. The left subclavian line is again seen, ending in the right atrium. If repositioning is clinically indicated, this tube could be pulled back approximately 4 cm to end in the low SVC.
