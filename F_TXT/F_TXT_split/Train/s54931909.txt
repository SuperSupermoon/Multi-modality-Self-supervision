Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Worsening heterogeneous opacities with mid and lower lung predominance probably represent a combination of widespread pneumonia and a component of accompanying pulmonary edema. Peripheral areas of consolidation in lower lungs are likely related to infectious pneumonia, but pulmonary infarcts could have a similar radiographic appearance. Small pleural effusions are also noted.
