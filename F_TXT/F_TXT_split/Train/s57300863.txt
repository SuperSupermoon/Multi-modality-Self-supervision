Interval placement of a nasogastric tube with the tip coursing below the diaphragm and projecting over the stomach. A left subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip at the cavoatrial junction. The lungs remain clear with no evidence of focal pneumonia, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. The left costophrenic angle is not entirely included on this study. No right-sided pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
