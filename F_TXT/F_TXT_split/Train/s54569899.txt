Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged due to cardiomyopathy and/or pericardial effusion. Patient is status post median sternotomy. A dual-lead left-sided pacer device is seen. The distal aspect of the leads are not seen due to underpenetration at the lower hemithorax. The hemidiaphragms are partially obscured but could relate to underpenetration, although there may also be a right-sided pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. There is mild prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature which could in part relate to low lung volumes. No pneumothorax is seen.
