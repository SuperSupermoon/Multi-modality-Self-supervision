Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier. There is no evident pneumothorax. Right PICC tip is in the upper-to-mid SVC. Left IJ catheter tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube is out of view below the diaphragm. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis larger on the left lower lobe are unchanged. There is mild-to-moderate vascular congestion.
