As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. There are areas of atelectasis at the left lung base and in the retrocardiac lung areas. Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus is new and could be caused by a minimal left pleural effusion. There are signs of minimal fluid overload. No evidence of pneumonia.
