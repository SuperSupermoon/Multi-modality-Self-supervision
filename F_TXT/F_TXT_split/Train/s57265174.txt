AP chest in the absence of recent prior chest radiographs, read in conjunction with the torso CT of ___. Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. Right lower lung is grossly clear. Left lower lung partially obscured by the cardiac silhouette is not consolidated. Large branching opacities in the upper lungs, particularly the left could be a combination of mucoid impaction and large vessels. The contour of the upper mediastinum was widened by extensive mediastinal fat in ___, but nevertheless raises concern for extensive adenopathy. I don't think more definitive diagnosis is possible from conventional radiographs and _chest CT be repeated. ET tube in standard position. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
