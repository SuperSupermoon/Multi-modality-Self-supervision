There are new diffuse alveolar opacities, most severe in the mid-to-lower lungs, right greater than left, which is concerning for new moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. Relative increased density within the right lung apex is concerning for a concurrent new pneumonia. Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged and may continue to reflect pneumonia and/or atelectasis. A moderate left pleural effusion appears increased and is now large. Small right pleural effusion is likely. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are obscured by diffuse edema.
