In comparison to the prior radiograph from earlier the same date, moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion persist, accompanied by a moderate right pleural effusion and adjacent right basilar atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is similar to the prior study, and adjacent left retrocardiac atelectasis is slightly improved. No other relevant change.
