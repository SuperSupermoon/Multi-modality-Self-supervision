Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Interval improved aeration at both lung bases, with only minimal residual linear atelectasis remaining at the left lung base. External structures overlie both upper lung regions, and could potentially obscure a subtle area of parenchymal abnormality. Repositioning of these devices would be helpful at the time of the next scheduled radiograph to allow better assessment of the upper lobes of the lungs.
