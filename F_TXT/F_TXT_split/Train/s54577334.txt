AP chest compared to 2:57 a.m. On the supine radiograph, the extent of large right and moderate left pleural effusions are underestimated, but both have increased since 2:57 a.m. Supine positioning would also be expected to the increased caliber of the mediastinum, so I cannot say that the interval change is pathologic. There is considerable atelectasis on the right lung that is new since earlier in the day. Left basal atelectasis is stable. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. ET tube is in standard placement. Left internal jugular line ends in the upper-to-mid SVC. There is no tracheal shift to suggest a hematoma related to the internal jugular line placement. No pneumothorax is present either.
