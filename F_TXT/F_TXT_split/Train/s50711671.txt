Lung volumes are low. Heart size is moderately enlarged. The left costophrenic angle is not seen due to overlying density; pleural effusion cannot be excluded. There is mild interstitial edema. The right atrial pacer lead is positioned deep, probably at the level of the tricuspid valve or right ventricle; the right ventricular lead appears appropriately positioned on this single view, but is not completely evaluated.
