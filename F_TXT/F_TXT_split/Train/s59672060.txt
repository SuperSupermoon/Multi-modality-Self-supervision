AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 10:18 a.m.: Mild pulmonary edema, worsening left lower lobe atelectasis and upper mediastinal widening all developed between ___ and ___. Over the past 15 hours, lung volumes have improved, mediastinal widening presumably due to vascular engorgement has decreased, but there is new perihilar opacification in the right lower lung which could be developing pneumonia or dependent edema, and a severe left lower lobe atelectasis has not improved. Small to moderate left pleural effusion persists. Lines and tubes are in their standard placements, unchanged. I see no pneumothorax.
