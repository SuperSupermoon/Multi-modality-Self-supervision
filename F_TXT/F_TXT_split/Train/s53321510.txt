1. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient rotation and somewhat lordotic technique on the current study. Lungs appear grossly clear with no focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia, pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles could reflect pleural thickening or tiny effusions. No acute bony abnormality.
