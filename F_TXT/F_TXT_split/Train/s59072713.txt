Left lower lobe atelectasis contributes to retrocardiac consolidation. Opacity in the left upper lobe is also noted, possibly also due to atelectasis. There is elevation of the left mainstem bronchus. The right lung is grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax. An endotracheal tube terminates above the level of the thoracic inlet, with hyperinflation of the cuff in the expected region of the larynx. Partially visualized right shoulder arthroplasty is noted. An esophageal catheter terminates in the stomach. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal vascular clips appear intact. The heart is mildly enlarged. Bilateral rib fractures are identified, some of which are chronic and some may be acute on the right.
