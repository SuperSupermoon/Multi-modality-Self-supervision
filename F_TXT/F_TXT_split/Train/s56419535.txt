A line overlying the right upper chest remains in place but is unclear as to its location. A tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. There continues to be overall volume loss in the left hemi thorax with patchy opacities throughout the lung and more focal consolidation in the retrocardiac region. There is also a layering left effusion. An infectious process should as well as atelectasis should be considered. Right lung is without focal consolidation. No pulmonary edema.
