In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a right pigtail catheter with removal of some pleural fluid. No evidence of pneumothorax. There is still extensive opacification at the right base that could reflect residual effusion, loculated effusion, or substantial volume loss in the middle and lower lobe on the right. The left lung is essentially clear except for minimal atelectatic changes.
