Right-sided Port-A-Cath unchanged in position. No interval change in streaky opacity in the left mid lung and at the right base suggestive of atelectasis rather than an acute infectious process. Clinical correlation, however, is advised. No large effusions. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. An intramedullary rod with multiple screws is once again identified within the left proximal humerus.
