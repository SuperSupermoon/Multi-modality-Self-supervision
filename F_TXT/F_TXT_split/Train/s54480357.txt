In comparison with the study of ___ and allowing for obliquity of the patient, there is probably little overall change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Continued enlargement of the cardiac margin with persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour. No gross evidence of vascular congestion or acute pneumonia on this somewhat limited study.
