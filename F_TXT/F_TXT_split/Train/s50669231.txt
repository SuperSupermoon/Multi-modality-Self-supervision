Support and monitoring devices are remarkable for tip of endotracheal tube terminating 6.5 cm above the carina. This could be advanced slightly for standard positioning. Asymmetrically distributed bilateral airspace opacities affecting the left mid and lower lung regions to a greater degree than the right, have slightly worsened in the interval, and moderate left and small-to-moderate right pleural effusions are also demonstrated. There is no visible pneumothorax.
