There is new small right apical pneumothorax. Right pectoral infusion port terminates in mid SVC. Right internal jugular venous catheter terminates in upper SVC. ET tube terminates 19 mm above the carina. A transesophageal tube terminates in the stomach. Lung volume is low. Right pleural effusion is moderate and left pleural effusion is small. Bibasilar opacities are likely secondary to atelectasis and pleural effusions. Cardiac silhouette is exaggerated by low lung volumes.
