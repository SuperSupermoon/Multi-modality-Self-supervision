The ET tube is 2.6 cm above the carina. There is mild cardiomegaly. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution and perihilar haze with patchy alveolar infiltrate, most marked on the right. There is probable left effusion. There is volume loss in the left lower lobe. The overall impression is that of fluid overload. A superimposed infection, particularly on the right, cannot be excluded.
