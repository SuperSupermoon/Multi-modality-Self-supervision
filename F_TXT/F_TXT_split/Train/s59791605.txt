Mild cardiomegaly is stable, mediastinal venous engorgement is slightly worse, mild edema has improved, particularly in the left lung, and right pleural effusion, difficult to assess in the non erect patient, appears smaller. There is still consolidation at both lung bases which although quite possibly residual edema and atelectasis, could be pneumonia and should be followed. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube, right jugular line, are in standard placements and an esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
