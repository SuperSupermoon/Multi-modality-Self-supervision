An ET tube is present, the tip lies at the level of the mid clavicular heads, approximately 6.5 above the Carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending and beneath diaphragm, off film. The sideport, if present, is not well visualized. A left PICC line is present, tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. No obvious mediastinal air is identified. There are slightly low inspiratory volumes, with patchy opacity at the left lung base, obscuring the left hemidiaphragm, and a small amount of patchy opacity at the right base. Probable small left effusion. Upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF--___ may be accounted for by low lung volumes.
