The lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is streaky left mid to lower lung opacification which suggests atelectasis. This appearance blurs the left costophrenic sulcus, making it difficult to exclude a small pleural effusion. There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right.
