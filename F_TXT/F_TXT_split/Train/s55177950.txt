In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 4 days prior, there has been interval placement of an ET tube, which terminates 3 cm above the carina. Moderate right pleural effusion is probably unchanged, taking into account changes in patient positioning. Increased, small left pleural effusion. Substantial bibasilar atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly with mild, unchanged pulmonary edema. An enteric tube terminates in the expected location the gastric body. A right-sided port/central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium.
