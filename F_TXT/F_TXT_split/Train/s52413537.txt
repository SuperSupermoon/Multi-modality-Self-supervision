As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased. There also is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting the presence of a minimal right pleural effusion. Other than that, no findings have changed. There is no overt pulmonary edema and no pneumonia. No pneumothorax. Unchanged appearance of the hilar and mediastinal structures.
