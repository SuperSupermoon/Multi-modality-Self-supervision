In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a Dobbhoff tube which is straddling the esophagogastric junction. This should be pushed forward and this information was telephoned to the nurse taking care of the patient, who informed me that the tube has been pushed forward. Opacification at the left base is consistent with some combination of volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural fluid.
