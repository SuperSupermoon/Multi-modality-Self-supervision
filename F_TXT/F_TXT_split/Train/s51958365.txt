Due to difficulty in patient positioning, only a supine portable radiograph was obtained. Multiple intact sternal wires and mediastinal clips denote prior cardiac surgery. There has been interval placement of a right IJ catheter terminating at the low SVC. The lung volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. No pneumothorax is detected, although the right costophrenic angle is excluded on this study and the patient is supine.
