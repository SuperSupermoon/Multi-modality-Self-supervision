As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone a right-sided VATS thoracotomy. An according chest tube is in place and a small post-procedural apical pneumothorax of approximately 1 cm in width is seen. In addition, the right lung apex and the right lung bases show post-procedural opacities, likely reflecting a combination of atelectasis and local bleeding. No pleural effusions. Low lung volumes. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No abnormalities in the left lung.
