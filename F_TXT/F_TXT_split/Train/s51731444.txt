Combination of moderate right pleural effusion and severe lower lobe atelectasis not appreciably changed since ___. Vascular congestion in the upper lungs and mediastinal venous engorgement have increased indicating volume overload and/or biventricular cardiac decompensation. There may be mild edema in the left perihilar lung, but this is difficult to separate from infrahilar consolidation due to persistent residual atelectasis or pneumonia. Heart is normal size but slightly larger than it has been. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. No pneumothorax.
