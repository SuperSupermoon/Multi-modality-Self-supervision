In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The patient has taken a better inspiration. The right hemidiaphragmatic contour is sharply seen. Opacification at the left base with silhouetting hemidiaphragm again is consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged. There is a suggestion of some increased opacification just above the minor fissure. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent a developing consolidation in the right upper lobe.
