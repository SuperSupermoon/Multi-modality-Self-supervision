Comparison is made to the prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. There is no evident pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes with increasing bibasilar atelectasis, larger on the left side. If any, there is a small left pleural effusion. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. There are no other interval changes.
