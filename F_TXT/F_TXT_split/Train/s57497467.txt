The pulmonary edema has essentially resolved. There is minimal bilateral costophrenic blunting laterally that could represent small effusions. There is minimal left basilar atelectasis. Cardiomegaly persists. As before there is aortic arch atherosclerosis and a tortuous descending aorta. Degenerative changes are noted within the spine as well as slight sigmoid scoliosis.
