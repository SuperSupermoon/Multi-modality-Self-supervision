The left subclavian PICC line now has its tip in the proximal SVC. Interval placement of an endotracheal tube that has its tip at the carina heading toward the proximal right mainstem bronchus and needs to be pulled back 3-4 cm. A nasogastric tube is now seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. A biliary stent is in place. A portion of a descending aortic stent is visualized. The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable. There is increasing consolidation at the left base with an associated effusion. These findings are most consistent with increasing lower lobe collapse rather than worsening pneumonia given the position of the ETT tube at this time. The right lung is grossly clear. No pneumothorax.
