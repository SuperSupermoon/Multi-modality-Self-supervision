There continues to be a diffuse bilateral airspace process with more consolidative components in both lower lobes. Overall, however, there is improving aeration, suggesting that there has been some interval improvement in the severe pulmonary edema. Alternatively, this could represent an infection superimposed on underlying interstitial lung disease. Clinical correlation is advised. There is likely a small layering left effusion. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning. No pneumothorax is seen.
