There has been interval improvement of the previously seen bilateral pleural effusions. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle and retrocardiac opacity suggests a left pleural effusion, and no significant right pleural effusion is noted. There is continued collapse and/or consolidation at the left base, improved compare with the ___ radiograph. Bilateral pleural catheters are again noted, 1 and each lung base. The cardiac mediastinal silhouette is normal, allowing for slight unfolding of the aorta. There is borderline upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. Left-sided pacemaker type device is again noted, with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle. No pneumothorax detected.
