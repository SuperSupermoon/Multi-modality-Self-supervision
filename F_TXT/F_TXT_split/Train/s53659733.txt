As compared to the previous radiograph, patient is malrotated and the region of the right lung apex and right shoulder is difficult to assess. Given these limitations, there currently is no safe evidence for the presence of a retained catheter fragment along the visible displayed course of the right subclavian vein. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral areas of atelectasis and mild fluid overload, unchanged course of the pacemaker leads. No new parenchymal opacities.
