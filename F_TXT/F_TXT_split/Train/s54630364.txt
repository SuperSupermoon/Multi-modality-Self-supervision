Interval enlargement of right pneumothorax, now large in size, with dominant loculated component at the right lung base and smaller component at the right apex. Slight flattening of adjacent right hemidiaphragm could potentially represent a component of tension, but there is no evidence of cardiomediastinal shift. Heterogeneous opacities in the right lung as well as loculated fluid at the right apex appears similar as well as other post-operative alterations in this patient status post right upper lobe wedge resection. Linear atelectasis at the left base has nearly resolved. Widespread subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated in the chest wall. Dr. ___ was successfully paged at 12:30 p.m. on ___ to discuss the pneumothorax at the time of discovery.
