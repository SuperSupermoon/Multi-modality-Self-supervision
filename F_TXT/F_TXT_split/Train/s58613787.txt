Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. After thoracocentesis, AP view demonstrates substantial decrease in right pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax on the current study. Minimal interstitial engorgement is noted that might represent volume overload or developing interstitial pulmonary edema. The rest of the findings are unchanged including left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
