AP chest compared to ___: Endotracheal tube has been advanced, now in standard position. Left subclavian line ends close or just beyond the superior cavoatrial junction. Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Relative hyperlucency of the right hemithorax is due in part to relative hyperinflation of the right lung, probably otherwise a radiologic technical artifact. There is no good evidence for pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart size normal.
