In comparison with the study of ___, there is an extensive spinal fusion in place involving most of the thoracic spine. Tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 3 cm above the carina. Right IJ port extends to the right atrium. There is increasing opacification silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and small pleural effusion. Atelectatic changes are also seen at the right base. In the appropriate clinical setting, would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
