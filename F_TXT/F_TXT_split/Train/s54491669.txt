Lung volumes are mildly decreased, and there continues to be a right lower lobe rounded opacity which corresponds with a Bochdalek hernia noted on prior CT. A hiatal hernia is again seen. The cardiac silhouette is stable in size, and a cardiac pacing device and its leads are in stable position. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No overt pulmonary edema is noted.
