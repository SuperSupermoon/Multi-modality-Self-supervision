Since the prior CXR performed yesterday afternoon, one of the left chest tubes has been removed and there is now one remaining. Worsening opacification of the left hemithorax that partially spares the left apex, likely from a moderate/severe pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. There is also right lung base atelectasis. No pneumothorax. The pneumopericardium has resolved. However, the cardiac silhouette is noticeably larger than yesterday; this may be due to rightward mediastinal shift from the left pleural effusion, or worsening pericardial effusion. Unchanged appearance of subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral chest wall. Surgical clips are noted in the left upper quadrant.
