Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 9 cm above the carina and could be advanced for standard positioning. Other indwelling devices are in standard position. The patient is status post recent aortic stent graft placement, with similar appearance of the stent graft and aortic contour compared to the recent radiograph. Heart size is normal. Pulmonary vascular congestion has slightly improved, with associated improving asymmetrical opacities in the left lung, likely due to asymmetrical edema, although other process such as aspiration is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Persistent layering left pleural effusion is also noted.
