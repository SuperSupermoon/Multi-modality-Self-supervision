AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC. The cardiomegaly is substantial. There is extensive tortuosity of the aorta with widening of its lower portion is demonstrated, chronicity and reason unclear, and should be correlated with prior imaging or cross-sectional imaging if no prior imaging is available. Pulmonary edema is demonstrated, mild. Small amount of pleural effusion is most likely present bilaterally. There is left deviation of the upper trachea that might be consistent with thyroid enlargement, which should be further assessed as well. Nodular opacity projecting over the upper portion of the left lung might be consistent with cartilage sclerosis, but pulmonary nodule is a possibility. Again, correlation with prior imaging or cross-sectional imaging in the absence of prior imaging is required.
