A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, left PICC terminating in the mid SVC, and enteric tube terminating within the stomach. Cardiac size remains normal. A right pleural effusion is likely unchanged, allowing for differences in patient position. The right lower lobe remains collapsed, but the right upper lobe is clear. Heterogeneous consolidation of the left lower lobe is worse compared to ___. There is no pneumothorax.
