Lung volumes are low resulting in bronchovascular crowding. Minimal opacities within the lung bases are improved from prior and likely reflect atelectasis. No large confluent consolidation is identified. There is no pulmonary edema or large pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Dense calcifications of the aortic knob are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
