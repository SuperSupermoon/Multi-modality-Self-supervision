A portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval intubation, with the endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea. There has also been interval placement of a right PICC, which terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The remainder of the exam is largely unchanged, except for improved aeration of the left lower lung.
