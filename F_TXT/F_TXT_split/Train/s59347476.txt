Heart size is mildly enlarged, slightly enlarged compared to the previous radiograph. The mediastinal contour is unchanged. Enlargement of the hila bilaterally is compatible with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. There is no pulmonary edema. Lungs are hyperinflated with marked emphysematous changes again noted. Increased interstitial markings are noted along the periphery and lung bases suggestive of a mild chronic interstitial abnormality. Patchy opacities the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, though infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
