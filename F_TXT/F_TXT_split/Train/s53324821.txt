There are relatively low lung volumes. Left base opacity may in part be due to an elevated diaphragm, however findings raise concern for pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude. Mild left base atelectasis is seen. There are left greater than right perihilar opacities which may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, infectious process not excluded. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. The right aspect of the cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the right base opacity.
