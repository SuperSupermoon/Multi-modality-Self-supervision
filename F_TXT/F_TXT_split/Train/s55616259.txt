Previous moderate right pleural effusion has resolved, and very small low, right anterior pneumothorax has developed since insertion of a pigtail pleural drain ending at the right lung base medially. A new left pigtail drainage catheter has been inserted deep in the lateral pleural sulcus with no apparent change in the appearance of the left hemi thorax. There is no pneumothorax and any pleural effusion was not detectable on conventional radiographs although a small left pleural effusion was shown on the abdomen CT ___. Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved. Heart size is top-normal, but smaller. Right supraclavicular central venous infusion port and a right PIC line both end close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
