The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The heart is mild to moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Superimposed on a large known mass in the right lower lobe are new multifocal opacities in both the right upper and lower lobes most suggestive of multifocal pneumonia. The left lung remains clear. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild rightward convex curvature is similar with osteophyte formation along the visualized thoracic spine.
