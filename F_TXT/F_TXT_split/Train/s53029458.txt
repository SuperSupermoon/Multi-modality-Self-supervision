The ET tube sits 3.5 cm above the carina. The endogastric tube side port is well below the GE junction. Left-sided central line tip sits at the lower SVC. The cardiomediastinal contours are normal. The lungs demonstrate mild interstitial edema, similar to prior studies. Additionally, subtly increased opacity of the right upper lobe is present, and may represent a developing consolidative process such as pneumonia. Indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour and blunting of the costophrenic sulci may indicate small bilateral pleural effusions, but more prominent on the left than the right as well as some associated atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
