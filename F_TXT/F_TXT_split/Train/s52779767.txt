In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. There is again evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm on the right. The degree of a lower lung opacification has decreased on the right, consistent either with improved pleural effusions or a more upright position of the patient. No convincing evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
