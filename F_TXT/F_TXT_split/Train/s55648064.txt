In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Continued low lung volumes with mild engorgement of pulmonary vessels. Bibasilar opacifications most likely representing atelectasis, though supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. There is an area of patchy opacification in the left mid zone. It is unclear whether this reflects overlying structures or could possibly be a manifestation of early aspiration. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
