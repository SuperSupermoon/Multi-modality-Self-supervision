As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The left PICC line remains in situ. The lung volumes have slightly decreased. As a consequence, the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities appear slightly denser than on the previous image. No new opacities are seen. The left costophrenic sinus, previously blunted by a small left pleural effusion, is now partly expanded.
