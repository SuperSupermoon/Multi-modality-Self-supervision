AP chest compared to ___: Moderate cardiomegaly with a strongly left atrial component and large pulmonary arteries are chronic. I doubt that there is any acute cardiac decompensation, since there is no increase in baseline pulmonary vascular engorgement, no edema, or pleural effusion. Nor is there good evidence for infection.
