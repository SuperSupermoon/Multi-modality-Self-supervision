The lung volumes are normal. Moderate cardiomegaly with signs of mild pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. Minimal atelectasis at both lung bases. Normal hilar and mediastinal contours, with the exception of a slightly prominent right upper mediastinum, potentially caused by a retrosternal goiter. Evaluation with ultrasound could be performed.
