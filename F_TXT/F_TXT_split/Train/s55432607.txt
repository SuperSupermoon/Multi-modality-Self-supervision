In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Again there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour and PA and some of this could well reflect pleural fluid with volume loss in the lower lung. The left hemidiaphragm is not well seen, consistent with pleural effusion and atelectatic changes at the left base. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to definitely exclude superimposed pneumonia.
