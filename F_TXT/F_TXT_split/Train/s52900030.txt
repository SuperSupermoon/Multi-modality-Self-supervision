Comparison is made with prior study, CT, ___. Radiolucency projecting in the left upper and mid left hemithorax reflects the presence of pneumothorax, better seen in prior CT. Multifocal consolidations in the left upper and lower lobes are grossly unchanged. There are no enlarging pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal contours are midline. Cardiac size is top normal. Atelectases in the right apex and right base are again noted. Left subcutaneous emphysema is mild. Left chest tube remains in place.
