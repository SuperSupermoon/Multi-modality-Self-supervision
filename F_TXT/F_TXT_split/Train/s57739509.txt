In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, an endotracheal tube has been advanced and still has a relatively proximal location, now approximately 7.1 cm above the carina. This could be advanced a few cm for standard positioning. Lower lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Even accounting for this factor, mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new. Worsening bibasilar opacities probably reflect atelectasis although aspiration and developing infection are additional considerations. Possible new small right pleural effusion, and no visible pneumothorax.
