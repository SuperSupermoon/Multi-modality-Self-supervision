The previously seen bibasal pleural effusions are no longer apparent. Prominence of the pulmonary hila and haziness of pulmonary vascular is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion. An intra-aortic balloon pump is in-situ. The balloon is distended on the current image. Bibasal atelectasis is likely related to the prior effusions. The 2 right lower lobe pulmonary nodules seen on the prior CT are not clearly seen on the current study.
