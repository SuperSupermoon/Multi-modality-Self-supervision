Frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a left pleural tube. There are two curvilinear opacities which are seen projecting over the left apex, but are difficult to discern secondary to projection of the bony structures in this area. This may represent a small apical pneumothorax. The left-sided port remains in standard position, unchanged since the prior study. Multiple bilateral parenchymal opacities are again seen, consistent with metastatic breast cancer. The heart size is unchanged.
