Left-sided chest tube remains in place, with no definite pneumothorax. Post-operative alterations related to left upper lobe resection appear similar, except for slight increase in small left pleural effusion with adjacent left basilar atelectasis. Right lung is clear except for minor atelectasis at the right base. Within the abdomen, note is made of a moderate gastric distention resulting in increased elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
