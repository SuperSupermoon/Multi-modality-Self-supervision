Pulmonary vascular engorgement and borderline edema are new accompanied by a tiny right pleural effusion; severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Moderate left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis have worsened, along with an increase in the left extrapleural or loculated pleural collection, possible hemothorax. Tiny right pleural effusion is probably not clinically significant.
