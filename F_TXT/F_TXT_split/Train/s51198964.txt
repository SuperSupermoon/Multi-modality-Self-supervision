Compared with ___ at 17:56 p.m., there has been considerable improvement in the right-sided effusion. There is increased opacity at the left base, consistent with increased collapse and/or consolidation and slight increase in the small left effusion. Upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring is consistent with CHF, also slightly worse. No pneumothorax is detected.
