The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased but improved from the prior studies of ___. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Biapical pleural thickening is symmetrical. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged, and there is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits allowing for slight rotation of the patient. Linear metallic densities projecting over the soft tissues of the bilateral neck appear stable over multiple prior studies.
