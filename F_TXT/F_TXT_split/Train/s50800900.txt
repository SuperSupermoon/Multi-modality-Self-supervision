Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities with intervening air bronchograms are slightly improved in the bilateral lung apices from the most recent prior study. No new opacities or pleural effusions are seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and unchanged. An endotracheal tube ends approximately 5 cm above the carina at the thoracic inlet. There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube with the tip in the left upper quadrant, likely in the gastric fundus.
