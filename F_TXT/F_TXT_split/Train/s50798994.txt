As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild elongation of the descending aorta. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. The pre-existing 8 mm pulmonary nodule in the left lung is constant in appearance. No new nodules. The nodule has been stable overall several examinations but workup by CT could nevertheless be performed on a non emergent basis.
