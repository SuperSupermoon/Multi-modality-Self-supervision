Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval worsening of pulmonary edema since the prior study eight hours earlier. The left mid lung opacity is unchanged acutely and could be atelectasis or scarring, but appears to have grown over the past several months, and could therefore be a mass. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Marked cardiomegaly is unchanged. A face mask rests over the tracheostomy.
