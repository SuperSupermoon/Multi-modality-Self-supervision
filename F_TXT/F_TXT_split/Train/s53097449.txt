In comparison with chest radiograph from ___, inspiratory volumes may be minimally improved. Left pleural effusion has mildly decreased. No large effusion on the right. New, ill-defined opacity at the right lung base is consistent with atelectasis, possibly with a small effusion. Retrocardiac opacity is consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and is grossly unchanged. There is no new focal consolidation. No pneumothorax detected. Left chest tube again noted, slightly different in configuration. Otherwise, moderate and support devices remain in unchanged position.
