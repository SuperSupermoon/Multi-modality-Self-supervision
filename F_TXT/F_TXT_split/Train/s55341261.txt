Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The radiograph demonstrates cardiomegaly, which is unchanged since the prior study but there is interval progression of pulmonary edema. There is also slightly asymmetric right lower lobe opacity that although might represent part of pulmonary edema might also reflect atelectasis. Prominence of the right mediastinum is demonstrated and although unchanged since the most recent chest radiograph appears to be new as compared to ___ and more remote radiograph. Although it can potentially represent distended vessels, lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded. Reevaluation of the patient after diuresis is suggested. If findings persist, evaluation with a chest CT is required.
