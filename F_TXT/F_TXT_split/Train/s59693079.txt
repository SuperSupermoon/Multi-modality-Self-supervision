Single frontal view of the chest. Endotracheal tube terminates 6.4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Bilateral chest tubes are new since the prior radiograph. Lung volumes are very low. Right lung diffuse consolidation is consistent with lung contusions and slightly improved since the prior CT. Mild edema has also slightly improved. A small right pleural effusion is stable. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is similar to prior. No pneumothorax. Heart size and mediastinal contours are stable. Bilateral rib fractures are seen to better detail on recent CT.
