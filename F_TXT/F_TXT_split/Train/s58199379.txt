Patient is status post median sternotomy. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. The lungs are relatively hyperinflated and there is again slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Subtle patchy right base opacity is new since the prior study, and could be due to underlying infection, aspiration, or atelectasis. The left lung is clear. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pulmonary edema.
