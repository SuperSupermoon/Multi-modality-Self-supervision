An opacity at the left lung base obscures the left hemidiaphragm and may be due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. A small right pleural effusion is also present. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. Included upper abdomen is unremarkable.
