There has been interval worsening of multifocal opacities, especially in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe with near-complete opacification clearly outlining the minor fissure. Opacities are also worse in bilateral apices, the lingula and both lung bases, worrisome for progressive multifocal pneumonia. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
