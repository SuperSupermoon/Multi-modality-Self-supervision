Following placement of a left pigtail pleural catheter, a left pleural effusion has only slightly decreased in size with residual moderate-to-large effusion remaining. Extensive adjacent consolidation and atelectasis persist within the left mid and lower lung. On the right, poorly defined consolidation in the right lower lobe has progressed and is accompanied by a persistent small right pleural effusion.
