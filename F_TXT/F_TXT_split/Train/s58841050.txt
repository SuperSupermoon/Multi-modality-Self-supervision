Comparison is made to the prior study performed 12 hours earlier. There is an endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and right IJ central line, which are unchanged in position. There is complete opacification of the left lung. The right lung demonstrates some developing opacities at the right base. No pneumothoraces are seen. Overall, the findings are relatively unchanged.
