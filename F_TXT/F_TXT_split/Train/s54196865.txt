Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is again seen increased some densities of both lungs, suggestive of pulmonary edema. However, this is improved since the prior study. Findings are more confluent at the bases. There is normal cardiac size and mediastinal wires. There are no pneumothoraces or pleural effusions. Calcified granuloma at the left lung base is again seen.
