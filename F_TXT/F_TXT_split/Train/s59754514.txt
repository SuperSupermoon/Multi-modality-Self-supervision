Tracheostomy tube, right internal jugular dialysis catheter, left PICC line and right chest tube are in stable position. Aortic CoreValve is unchanged. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is consistent with trace pleural effusion, but no pneumothorax. Moderate left pleural effusion is not significantly changed with slight redistribution related to position. No change in mild pulmonary edema.
