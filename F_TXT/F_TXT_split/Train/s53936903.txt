The heart is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The lung volumes are low. There is a heterogeneous reticular abnormality which appears similar to perhaps minimally increased on the right side. Opacification is characterized by fine reticular opacities in a heterogeneous distribution, primarily suggestive of interstitial lung disease, although it is difficult to completely exclude a superimposed acute process. There are no definite effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.
