Rotated positioning, low lung volumes. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.8 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm, overlying stomach. Extensive spinal hardware noted. The heart borders are obscured, but the heart is probably not enlarged. There are diffuse opacities throughout both lungs, with denser left retrocardiac opacity and obscuration of left-greater-than-right hemidiaphragms. Possibility of small effusions cannot be excluded. Compared with ___ at 20:18 p.m.and allowing for technical differences, there has been possible increase in the degree of hazy opacity in the right and left mid zones, reflecting worsening CHF. Otherwise, findings are overall similar.
