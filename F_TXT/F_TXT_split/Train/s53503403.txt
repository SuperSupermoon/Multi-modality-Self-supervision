Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.6 cm above the carina, withdrawal is recommended. Lung volumes are decreased, and there is interval development of right basal atelectasis. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is also likely secondary to small amount of pleural effusion. Heterogeneous consolidation of the left lower lobe is slightly improved, however previously described differential remains, including aspiration, pneumonia or procedure related hemoptysis.
