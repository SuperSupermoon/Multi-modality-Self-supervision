As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in constant position. There is minimally improved ventilation of the apicolateral parts of the left lung. However, large parts of the left lung are still completely atelectatic. Moderate cardiomegaly is present. It appears as if the left main bronchus would be slightly narrowed. The right lung is better ventilated than on the previous image. However, slight and probably atelectatic opacities at the right lung base persist.
