Even allowing for the projection, the cardiac silhouette is enlarged. There is persistent airspace opacity in the right upper lobe which may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema versus infection. There is new partial silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm which may be due to left lower lobe atelectasis or a layering pleural effusion. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is similar in degree when compared to the prior study.
