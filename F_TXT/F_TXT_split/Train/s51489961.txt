Lung volumes are low which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears at least mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of subsegmental atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly visualized. No subdiaphragmatic free intraperitoneal gas is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
