As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain very low. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with minimal areas of atelectasis at both lung bases and minimal increase in diameter of the vascular structures, potentially reflecting mild fluid overload. Overt pulmonary edema, however, is not present. No pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumonia.
