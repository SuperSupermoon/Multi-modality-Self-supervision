Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates hyperexpansion of lungs with relative lucency of the upper lung zones, consistent with chronic lung disease. There is a persistent asymmetric increased opacity in the right lung base, similar across multiple prior studies and possibly representing combination of scarring and atelectasis. No new focal opacifications evident. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Heart size is top normal. Stable positioning of dual-chamber pacemaker noted. No osseous abnormality is present.
