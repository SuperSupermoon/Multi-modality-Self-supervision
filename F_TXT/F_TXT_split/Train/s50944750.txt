In comparison with the study of ___, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been pulled back to the pulmonary outflow tract. The IABP catheter has migrated superiorly. It could be pulled back approximately 2 cm to be in ideal position. The pulmonary vessels are engorged and not sharply seen, suggesting some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The hemidiaphragms are not as well seen, especially on the left, which could be a manifestation of pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases.
