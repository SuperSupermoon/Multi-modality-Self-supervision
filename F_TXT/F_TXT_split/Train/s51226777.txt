In comparison to prior studies, there has been interval improvement in pulmonary edema and near resolution. Bilateral pleural effusions have nearly resolved, however a small right pleural effusion remains. The IABP terminates within 1.4 cm of the superior aspect of the aortic knob. No focal consolidations or pneumothorax.
