A right internal jugular venous catheter terminates in the upper right atrium. A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged. The heart is mild to moderately enlarged. Allowing for differences in technique including lower lung volumes, the mediastinal and hilar contours appear likely unchanged including prominence of the aortopulmonary window suggesting perhaps enlargement of the main pulmonary artery. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. Blunting and hazy opacity in the left lower hemithorax and costophrenic sulcus suggests a small pleural effusion. There is no definite pleural effusion on the right. There is a mild interstitial abnormality suggesting mild pulmonary congestion. Scarring at each lung apex is probably unchanged.
