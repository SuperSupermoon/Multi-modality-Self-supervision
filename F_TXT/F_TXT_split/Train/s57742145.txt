The lung volumes remain low. Hazy opacification of the right lung base likely reflects a layering small-to-moderate right pleural effusion. No significant pneumothorax or left pleural effusion. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. Right basilar atelectasis is longstanding. No definite focal consolidation is seen. A tracheostomy tube is in place. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Increased prominence of the mediastinum is related to patient positioning and tortuosity of the aorta.
