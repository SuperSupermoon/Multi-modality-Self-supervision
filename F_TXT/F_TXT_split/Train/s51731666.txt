The patient is status post sterntomoy. Perihilar opacification on the left appears unchanged and is probably post-surgical. Superimposed is a generalized hazy opacification of each lung, with indistinct pulmonary vessels, most suggestive of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. It is difficult to exclude small pleural effusions and the retrocardiac area is under-penetrated.
