2 chest drains are now in-situ in the right lung. There is improved aeration of the right lung base although there is residual pleural fluid, the configuration suggests this is likely loculated. Airspace opacity in the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis but consolidation cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax seen. The left lung appears grossly clear.
