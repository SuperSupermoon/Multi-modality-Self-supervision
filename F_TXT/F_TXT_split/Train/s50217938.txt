A right internal jugular catheter is in-situ, the tip is in the mid SVC. The patient is intubated, the endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is in-situ, the tip is out of view but below the diaphragm. Left basal opacity is unchanged, likely reflecting atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. The right lung base appears clear, there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
