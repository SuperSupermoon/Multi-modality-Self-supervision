No previous images. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 3.8 cm above the carina. The Dobbhoff tube straddles the esophagogastric junction with much of the metallic portion in the distal esophagus. This tube should be pushed forward. No evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumoperitoneum, though this is not fully erect image. Cardiac silhouette is essentially within normal limits. There is some indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The outer most portion of the right lung has been excluded from the image.
