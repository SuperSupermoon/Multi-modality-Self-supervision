A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates multiple intact sternal wires, mediastinal clips, and a central line terminating in the upper right atrium. Heart size remains severely enlarged. Retrocardiac opacity is persistent but improved compared to chest radiograph from the day prior. Previously seen mild pulmonary edema is improved as well. There is no focal consolidation or appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
