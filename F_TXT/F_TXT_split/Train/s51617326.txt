ET tube tip lies 4.8 cm above the carina. NG tube tip extends beneath the diaphragm off the film. No pneumothorax is detected. Allowing for technical differences, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. This is more pronounced than on the prior study. Allowing for technical differences, the retrocardiac opacity itself is unchanged, but there is some more patchy opacity at the left lung base likely related to this CHF. Right cardiophrenic opacity appears slightly improved. Partially imaged cervical thoracic spine fixation hardware is noted, not fully evaluated.
