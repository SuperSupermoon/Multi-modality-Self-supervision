I cannot be sure whether a small vague opacity in the right Lung just above the minor fissure at the level of the third anterior rib is new, much less how old is. If it is acute, it is small infection or infarction, but it could be chronic or the residual of a since resolved infection. I would repeat a chest radiograph in 24 hr. Lungs are otherwise clear. Heart size is normal. Pleural effusion minimal if any. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.
