As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right internal jugular vein catheter. The tip of the catheter projects over the right atrium. The catheter should be pulled back by approximately 4 cm to ensure correct position in the mid-to-lower SVC. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.
