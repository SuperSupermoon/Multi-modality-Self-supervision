Single portable chest radiograph was provided. Again seen is a large right lower lobe opacity, representing known mass. Superinfection cannot be excluded. A small small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is seen and appears increased since the prior exam. Hyperlucency of the upper lung zones and hyperinflation is consistent with known emphysema. There is no pneumothorax. No left pleural effusion is identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. A VP shunt catheter courses along the right hemithorax and is incompletely imaged.
