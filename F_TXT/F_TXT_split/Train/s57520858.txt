There is small right apical pneumothorax noted. There is a larger left apical pneumothorax present. Bilateral chest tubes, right subclavian line, mediastinal contour are stable but there is left lower lobe opacity with left mediastinal shift most likely consistent with new atelectasis compression of the partially collapsed lung. Subcutaneous air within the right chest wall is unchanged.
