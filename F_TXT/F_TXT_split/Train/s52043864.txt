The heart size is normal. There is mild bilateral perihilar fullness, otherwise the hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is a large consolidation at the right lower lobe as well as diffuse opacities throughout the right upper lung. Mild peribronchiolar cuffing with interstitial thickening is seen at the left lung base, consistent with pulmonary edema. There is likely a moderate right pleural effusion. Note is made of a subtle increase in lucency at the left lung base. ET tube terminates approximately 6.1 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film.
