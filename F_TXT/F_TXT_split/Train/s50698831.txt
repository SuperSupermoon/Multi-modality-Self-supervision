Tip of the endotracheal tube 4.5 cm from the carina with the chin down is acceptable. Two nasogastric tubes pass as far as the distal esophagus and out of view. The left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC. Despite the indwelling left thoracostomy tube, moderate to large left pleural effusion persists, probably responsible for left lower lobe collapse. Slightly smaller right pleural effusion is larger today and there is more consolidation in the right lower lung either also collapse or pneumonia. Heart is normal size. There is no pneumothorax.
