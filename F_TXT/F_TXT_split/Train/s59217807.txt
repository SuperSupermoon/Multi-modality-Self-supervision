As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been advanced. The tip of the tube now projects 4.3 cm above the carina. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The other monitoring and support devices are in constant position, no relevant change. The appearances of the lung parenchyma, the heart, and the mediastinum are constant.
