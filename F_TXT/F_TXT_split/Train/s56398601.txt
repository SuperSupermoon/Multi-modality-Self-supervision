Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained. Three left-sided chest tubes remain in place. There is no pneumothorax. The left pleural effusion has decreased in size. The previous focal opacity in the right upper lung zone has cleared. The pre-existing left upper lobe opacity as well as lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis are unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. Extensive sclerotic metastases are again noted in bones.
