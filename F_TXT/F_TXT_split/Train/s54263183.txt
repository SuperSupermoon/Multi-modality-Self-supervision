Since 1 day prior, left upper lung and right lower lung consolidations have increased in density. Innumerable nodular opacities consistent with known metastasis appear relatively unchanged. Lateral left pleural thickening is unchanged. Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged. Heart size and cardiomediastinal silhouettes are inadequately evaluated on this study.
