In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends well into the stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the image. The position of the endotracheal tube is unchanged. The left hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, suggesting clearing of a mucous plug with subsequent improved aeration in the left lower lobe.
