There has been interval removal of the endogastric tube. The left central line tip sits at the left brachiocephalic vein while the right central line tip sits in the upper SVC. The heart size is at the upper limits of normal but is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Additionally, bibasilar opacities are somewhat worsened with no clear delineation of the costophrenic angles. These findings are compatible with small bilateral pleural effusions with associated worsening atelectasis at both bases. There is no pneumothorax.
