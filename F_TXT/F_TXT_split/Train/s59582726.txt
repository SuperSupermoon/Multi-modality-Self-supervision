As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach. There is no complication, notably no pneumothorax. Very low lung volumes with areas of relatively extensive atelectasis at both the right and the left lung bases as well as the moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema. A small air-fluid level projecting over the heart suggests the presence of a hiatal hernia. No pleural effusions.
