Endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating approximately 1.6 cm from the carina. Low lung volumes are present. This accentuates the cardiac silhouette size which is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal contour is also widened, but again this may be due to low lung volumes and supine positioning. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities are noted within the left upper lobe and left lung base. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. A VP shunt catheter is noted coursing along the right neck and chest. No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
