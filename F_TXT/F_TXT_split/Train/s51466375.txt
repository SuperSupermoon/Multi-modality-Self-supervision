The endotracheal tube terminates 3.2 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is present in courses into the stomach. The heart is mildly enlarged. Bilateral interstitial opacities are compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. There are small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, the latter resulting in air bronchograms. Superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax.
