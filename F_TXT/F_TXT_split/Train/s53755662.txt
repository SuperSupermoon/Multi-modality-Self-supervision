Right PICC tip terminates in the lower SVC. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the presence of bilateral moderate pleural effusions, right greater than left, similar compared to the prior study. The heart size though is likely enlarged. The aorta remains tortuous and calcified. Bibasilar atelectasis persists. No pneumothorax is present.
