Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. There has been interval removal of a right IJ central venous catheter. There are low lung volumes. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with overlying atelectasis. Relatively linear opacity in the left mid lung may represent atelectasis, but consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
