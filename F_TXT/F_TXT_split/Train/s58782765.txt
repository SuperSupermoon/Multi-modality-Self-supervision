The patient is status post median sternotomy. Heart size is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Linear opacities in the left lung base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is likely indicative of a small pleural effusion. No pneumothorax or right-sided pleural effusion is present. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
