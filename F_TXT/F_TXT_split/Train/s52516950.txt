In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval change. Again there are diffuse coarse opacifications bilaterally with evidence of previous left upper lobe resection and displacement of the trachea to the left. PICC line remains in good position. There is the vague suggestion of more coalescent opacification at the left base. In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of developing consolidation could be considered.
