Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged from prior examination. The mediastinal contour is unremarkable. A new consolidation at the right lung base may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, although it appears out of proportion to only mild central pulmonary vascular congestion with relative lack of interstitial edema elsewhere. A right internal jugular wide-bore catheter terminates at the level of the mid SVC. A left anterior chest wall ICD remains in position with unchanged position of the intracardiac as well as a single extracardiac lead. This extracardiac lead follows a somewhat tortuous path but is unchanged since at least ___. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
