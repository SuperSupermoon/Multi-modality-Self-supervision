AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. During the interval, the right-sided chest tube has been removed. The right lung remains aerated and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. The previously noted rather sizable local chest wall emphysema along the lower thorax has markedly improved. The pulmonary findings are practically unchanged, and there remain still a few linear atelectatic changes bilaterally on the bases, but no new infiltrates are present.
