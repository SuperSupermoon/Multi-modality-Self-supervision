Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, stable on the right, increased on the left, which in conjunction with some improvement in previous left lower lobe collapse would explain return of the mediastinum to the midline. There is no pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiac enlargement is stable. Upper mediastinal veins are dilated indicating elevated right heart pressure. ET tube and right internal jugular venous line are in standard placements and a nasogastric drainage tube passes into the nondistended stomach and out of view.
