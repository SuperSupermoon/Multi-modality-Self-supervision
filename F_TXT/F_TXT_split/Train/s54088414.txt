AP chest compared to ___: Severe global consolidation has worsened dramatically since ___ a.m. on ___. What was previously more pronounced consolidation in the right lung particularly the upper lobe is still the case, but consolidation has worsened in the remainder of the lungs, now accompanied by substantial pleural effusion. The interval change could be due to cardiogenic edema alone, but concurrent pneumonia is likely and I would not be able to detect the onset of noncardiogenic edema. Heart size is only top normal. No pneumothorax.
