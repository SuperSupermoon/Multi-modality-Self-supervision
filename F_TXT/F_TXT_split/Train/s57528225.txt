A new right internal central jugular venous catheter has been placed which terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Patchy streaky left basilar opacity persists, but now there is also a new mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality including peribronchial cuffing suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion. Mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is similar. There is no pneumothorax.
