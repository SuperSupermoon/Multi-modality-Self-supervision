As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a tracheostomy tube and the previously placed endotracheal tube was removed. The nasogastric tube is unchanged. Unchanged lung volumes, no evidence of pneumothorax. The subtle parenchymal opacities at both lung bases, notably at the bases of the middle lobe and right lower lobe, documented on CT examination from ___, are not appreciated on the radiograph.
