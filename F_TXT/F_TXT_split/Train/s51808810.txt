Severe consolidation in the right lower lobe yesterday has improved, as it did in the right upper lobe the day before. The most plausible explanation is asymmetric pulmonary edema. Mild interstitial edema persists. Heart is only top-normal size and pleural effusion small if any. The chin is flexed, so the ET tube ending more than 6 cm above the carina is too high and should be advanced 2-3 cm. Left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC, and a feeding tube in the stomach.
