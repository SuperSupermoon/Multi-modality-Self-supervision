Extensive left greater than right pulmonary opacities predominantly accounted for by known metastatic disease and fibrotic changes are similar in degree. More confluent opacities in the left lower lobe are similar to the previous study allowing for differences in lung volumes and could reflect aspiration or pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present without pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is obscured but appears grossly stable. Right Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position.
