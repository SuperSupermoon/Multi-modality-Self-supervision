In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. The Port-A-Cath remains in place with the tip in the lower portion of the SVC or cavoatrial junction. Prominence of the AP window again is seen, which could reflect an enlarged pulmonary artery. There is some indistinctness of prominent pulmonary vessels, suggesting some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
