As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The endotracheal tube appears to have been pulled back. The tip of the tube now projects 6 cm above the carina. The tube could be advanced by 1-2 cm. The course of the Dobbhoff catheter and the right subclavian line is unchanged. Unchanged evidence of right more than left pleural effusion and bilateral areas of atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. No evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
