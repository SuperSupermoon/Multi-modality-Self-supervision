Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided. Increased opacity at the left lung base is concerning for pneumonia with associated pleural effusion. There is emphysema with biapical pleural parenchymal scarring. Faint linear density at the right lung base could represent atelectasis versus scarring. The heart size appears grossly stable though the left heart border is partially obscured. Mediastinal contour is normal. Bony structures are intact.
