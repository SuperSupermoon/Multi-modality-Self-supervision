As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase of the atelectasis at the right lung bases. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, so that minimal right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. On the left, there is almost unchanged atelectasis at the retrocardiac lung areas. No larger left-sided effusion. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. Unchanged monitoring and support devices. No evidence of pneumothorax.
