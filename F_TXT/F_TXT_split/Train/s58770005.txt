The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is persistent patchy opacity projecting along the right suprahilar region with volume loss, probably compatible with treatment effect, aside from slightly diminished peripheral streaky opacification, but no other definite change. Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
