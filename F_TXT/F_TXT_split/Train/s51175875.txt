Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Right basilar opacity previously noted to represent pleural effusion and atelectasis with the right hemidiaphragm remaining elevated. A lateral view would be helpful for further evaluation. The left lung is clear. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
