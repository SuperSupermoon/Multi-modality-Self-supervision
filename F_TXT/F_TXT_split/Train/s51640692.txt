Patient is status post median sternotomy and ascending thoracic aorta dissection repair with similar appearance of the superior mediastinal contour. Lung volumes are low. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. A small left pleural effusion is noted. There is atelectasis at the lung bases without focal consolidation. Assessment of the left apex is obscured by the patient's neck and chin projecting over this area. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
