Comparison is made with prior study ___. There are persistent low lung volumes. Cardiac size is mildly enlarged, unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. Increasing opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally, left greater than right, are consistent with increasing atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
