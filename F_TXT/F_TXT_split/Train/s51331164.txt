Lung volumes are lower, which may be intentional, reflecting lower positive pressure support, and this could exaggerate the radiographic severity of lung abnormalities, but there has clearly been an increase in the radiodensity of the large areas of consolidation in both lower lobes over the past 24 hr. Heart size is top normal and there are no findings to suggest volume overload. Worsening infection must be considered. ET tube standard placement. Sharp definition of the cuff suggests secretions are pooling above it. Bilateral jugular lines and in lower SVC. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. No pneumothorax.
