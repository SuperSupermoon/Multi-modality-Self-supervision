Lung apices are excluded from this examination centered at the diaphragm. New feeding tube, with the wire stylet in place, ends in the mid stomach. Left lung is grossly clear. Moderately severe atelectasis at the right lung base is stable. Pleural effusions are small if any. Diaphragm contours obscure the heart which is probably not enlarged. Mediastinal venous engorgement has improved since yesterday.
