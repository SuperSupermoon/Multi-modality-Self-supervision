A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC. The trachea is central. The cardiomediastinal contour demonstrates moderate cardiomegaly with prominence of the bilateral hila and haziness of the pulmonary vasculature. There is prominence of the interstitial markings bilaterally, overall the appearances are consistent with pulmonary edema. This appears slightly worse than on the prior study. No pleural effusion appreciated. No pneumothorax seen.
