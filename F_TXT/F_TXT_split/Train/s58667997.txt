Nasogastric tube is seen below the diaphragmwith tip in at least distal stomach.. A left-sided internal jugular central venous catheter with tip tip in the upper upper superior vena cava. Right-sided internal jugular venous catheter with tip likely at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. Endotracheal tube is in standard position. There has been interval minimal decreased in size of the right pleural effusion, now moderate in size with overall improved aeration of the right lung base. Large left effusion is probably stable in size, though assessment difficult given increased retrocardiac opacification, likely due to worsened collapse.
