Lung volumes are low. Heart size is accentuated as result of low lung volumes appearing borderline enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
