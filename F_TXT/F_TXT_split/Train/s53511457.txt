Compared to the prior study there has been interval improvement of aeration at the right lung base with decreased right pleural effusion. There is persistent opacity throughout the left lung likely reflecting combination of asymmetric pulmonary edema pulmonary edema, atelectasis and a left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax seen. Infection cannot be excluded. Alignment of the sternal wires is unchanged compared to the prior study. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
