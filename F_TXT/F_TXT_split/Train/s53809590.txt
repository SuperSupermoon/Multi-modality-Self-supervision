Low lung volumes are low. The cardiac silhouette size is accentuated due to low lung volumes, but remains within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures as result of the low lung volumes. Small right pleural effusion is re- demonstrated, with increased opacification within the right lung base which is concerning for infection or aspiration. Minimal patchy opacity within the periphery of the left lung base could reflect scarring or atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
