AP chest compared to ___ at 8:46 p.m.: Lung volumes are low, worsened since ___. Cardiomegaly is mild, and there has been a slight increase in caliber of pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature suggesting possible volume overload, but I do not see pulmonary edema or any radiographically evident explanation for tachypnea.
