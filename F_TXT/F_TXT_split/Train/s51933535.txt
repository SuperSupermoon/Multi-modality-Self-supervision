Left chest tube is in place. There is small apical pneumothorax and subcutaneous air. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Large hiatal hernia is demonstrated. Right lung is essentially clear except for minimal right basal opacity most likely representing atelectasis. Aortic knob is not clearly seen, most likely due to a adjacent postsurgical hematoma, continuous surveillance is recommended with chest radiographs.
