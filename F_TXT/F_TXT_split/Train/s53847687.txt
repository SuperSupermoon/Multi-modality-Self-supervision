Tracheostomy tube remains in place, with over-distention of the tracheostomy tube cuff with respect to the tracheal lumen. Multifocal airspace opacities with upper lung predominance have slightly worsened in the interval, particularly within the right lower lobe. These findings are concerning for multifocal pneumonia with or without coexisting pulmonary edema or ARDS. Small right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion are unchanged.
