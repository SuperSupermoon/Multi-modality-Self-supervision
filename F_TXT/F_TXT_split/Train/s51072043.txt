There is unchanged deformity of the right hemithorax with volume loss and diffuse calcification, likely related to prior pneumonectomy. Suture chain material projecting over the left mid hemithorax is consistent with prior wedge resections. There is increased opacification at the left lung base silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm and the left heart border with an apparent meniscus compatible with a small left pleural effusion, increased from the prior studies. Patchy airspace opacities in the upper and mid lung zones most likely reflect a combination of pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and pneumonia. There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion, increased from the most recent prior study. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal contours are difficult to appreciate but overall unchanged.
