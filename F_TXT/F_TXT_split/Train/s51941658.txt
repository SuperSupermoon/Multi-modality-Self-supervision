Low lung volumes accentuate pulmonary vasculature markings. Patchy bilateral opacities in each lung with prominent interstitial component suggests multifocal pneumonia, although a heterogeneous pattern of pulmonary edema could also be considered. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is noted. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
