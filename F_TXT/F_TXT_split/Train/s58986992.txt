There has been interval removal of the right-sided pigtail catheter. No pneumothorax seen. There is a small right pleural effusion. Increased airspace opacity at the right base likely reflects atelectasis. There is persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. An additional drain projects over the left heart, this is presumed to be a pericardial drain and is unchanged in position compared to the prior study. A large lung nodule is noted in the left mid lung measuring approximately 1.3 cm, similar in appearance when compared to the prior CT. There is gaseous distension of small bowel loops in the left upper quadrant measuring up to 4.9 cm. This is improved when compared to the prior radiographs.
