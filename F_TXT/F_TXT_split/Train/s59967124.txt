Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Heterogeneous opacification of the left lung is consistent with a combination of pleural fluid and consolidation/atelectasis, presumably related to multiple fractures left middle ribs laterally. The pulmonary vasculature is diffusely indistinct, consistent with mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. The heart is moderately enlarged and the vascular pedicle is widened necessitating CT evaluation. A few left rib fractures are minimally displaced. Sternotomy wires are intact.
