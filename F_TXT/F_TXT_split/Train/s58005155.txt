There are low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding. Again seen is markedly asymmetrical elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, with loops of gas-filled bowel beneath the right hemidiaphragm. Opacity of the right hemithorax is consistent with collapse of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe seen on CT of the torso performed after this study. The heart is enlarged. Pacemaker device is present, with leads ending in the right atrium and right ventricle.
