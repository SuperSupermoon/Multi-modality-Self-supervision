1. No evidence of acute disease. 2. Apparent nodular opacity projecting near the site of an EKG lead at the left lung apex. Differential considerations include a lung nodule including the possibility of malignancy although atelectasis, scarring or artifact could also be considered. Initial re-evaluation is recommended with PA and lateral radiographs in the short term when clinically appropriate. If the density were to persist, then chest CT may be appropriate to evaluate further. Findings and recommendations posted to the ER dashboard while the patient was still in the ER.
