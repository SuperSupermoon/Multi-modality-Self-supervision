A left-sided chest tube is present. There is a small peripheral pneumothorax seen at the left apex hand along the upper left lung. There is subcutaneous emphysema. A large rounded density lies near the tip of the chest tube, abutting the mediastinum with expected level of the aortic arch. There are focal the somewhat mass-like densities in the left mid lung laterally the abutting the left chest wall. There is some increased density with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, as well, consistent with some degree of lower lobe collapse/consolidation. Equivocal minimal leftward mediastinal shift. The right lung volume is slightly low, but there is no evidence of CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion on the right side. No right-sided pneumothorax.
