In the interim, since the most recent chest radiograph, there has been placement of a right IJ line which projects over the expected region of the cavoatrial junction. A nasogastric tube passes with side port in the expected region of stomach and tip not evaluated in the field of view provided. Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, increased since the prior examination. A cavitary lesion is noted in the right lung with increased consolidation of the right lung. A left paramedian line with four radiodense markers is likely external to the patient (per discussion with Dr. ___ at 3:58 pm ___ via telephone there is no evidence of intraaortic pump in this patient).
