Compared to the prior day, a left internal jugular central venous catheter again terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. An opacity projecting over the right upper hemithorax may represent an artifact, noting that it was not present on very recent prior radigraphs from ___. There are moderate layering pleural effusions and basilar opacities which are not specific, although most often would be associated with atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Findings are similar to the prior examination, allowing for differences in technique.
