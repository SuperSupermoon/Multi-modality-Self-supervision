In comparison with the study of ___, the basilar opacification of the left base has improved. There is, however, some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could reflect some increasing pulmonary venous pressure. There has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina and a nasogastric tube that extends well into the stomach. Hazy opacification at the left base could represent some pleural effusion.
