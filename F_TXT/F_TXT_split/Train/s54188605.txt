Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and coils in the expected location of the stomach. There are low lung volumes, which likely in part accentuate the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The superior mediastinum is widened. If there is clinical concern for acute mediastinal injury, suggest chest CTA. Difficult to exclude small left pleural effusion. Relative opacity over the right lung is nonspecific but underlying pulmonary contusion not excluded.
