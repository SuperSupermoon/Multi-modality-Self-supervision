1. Right mainstem bronchus stent present. No pneumothorax detected. 2. Increased interstitial markings. More focal opacities at the right lung base could represent a postobstructive pneumonia and followup imaging to confirm resolution is recommended. 3. Stellate right right upper lobe lesion seen on the recent CT scan is not definitely appreciated radiographically. As per the recent chest CT, if clinically indicated, PET-CT could help for further assessment.
