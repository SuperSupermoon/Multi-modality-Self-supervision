AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___ with patient in semi-upright position. Patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position terminating some 4 cm above the level of the carina. An NG tube exists as before and reaches well below the diaphragm. Unchanged position of previously described right subclavian central venous line. Mediastinal shift towards the right exists and results in reduced pulmonary volume of the right hemithorax. Comparison of the portable frontal view suggests that the amount of pleural effusion of the right side has increased again as now a 1 cm wide dense layer inside the right lateral chest wall is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax on either side.
