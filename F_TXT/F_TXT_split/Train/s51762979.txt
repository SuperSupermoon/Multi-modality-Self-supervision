Endotracheal tube is new, terminating approximately 8 cm from the carina, at the level of the thoracic inlet. Nasogastric tube tip is suboptimally positioned with the tip terminating above the gastroesophageal junction. The heart remains moderate to severely enlarged. The patient is status post median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement. Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right right ventricle. Worsening bilateral parenchymal opacities predominantly in a perihilar distribution are noted with increased confluence, likely reflective of pulmonary edema which is moderate to severe. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. Small right pleural effusion is re- demonstrated. No pneumothorax is identified.
