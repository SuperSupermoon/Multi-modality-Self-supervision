Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___. Previous pneumothorax has probably resolved the low loose skin folds projecting over the left hemi thorax and presence of subcutaneous emphysema in left chest wall make that determination uncertain although there is a small left pleural effusion. The new triangular region of radiodensity in the left midlung is probably collapse of the superior segment left lower lobe. Right lower lobe is still largely collapsed accompanied by small to moderate right pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs strongly recommended.
