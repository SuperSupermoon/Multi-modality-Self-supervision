Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina, and a nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by perihilar edema. More confluent opacities at the bases could reflect dependent edema, or co-existing atelectasis, aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Bilateral pleural effusions are also present, small to moderate in size.
