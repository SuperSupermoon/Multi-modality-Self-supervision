AP portable upright view of the chest. Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted. The heart remains moderately enlarged. There are diffuse pulmonary airspace opacities right greater than left, concerning for pulmonary edema, though difficult to exclude a superimposed pneumonia. No large effusion is seen. No pneumothorax. Mediastinal contour is grossly unchanged. Bony structures are intact. The superior most sternotomy wire appears fragmented as on prior.
