Right jug Swan-Ganz catheter, endotracheal tube, left chest tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. Interval placement of a right internal jugular pacing wire which has its tip projecting over the expected location of the right ventricle. Status post median sternotomy for CABG and aortic valve replacement with stable postoperative cardiac enlargement. The right lung is clear. Scattered linear opacities in the left lung likely reflect atelectasis. Interval resolution of mild pulmonary edema. There is cephalization of the vasculature consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension, however. No pneumothorax.
