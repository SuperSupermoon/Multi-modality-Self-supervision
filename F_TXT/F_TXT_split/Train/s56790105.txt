Widespread heterogeneous opacities have developed throughout both lungs, involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left. Observed findings could reflect a combination of pneumonia and pulmonary edema superimposed upon known chronic fibrotic lung disease. Differential diagnosis includes acute exacerbation of chronic lung disease. Large hiatal hernia is noted as well as persistent cardiomegaly. Bilateral small pleural effusions are also evident.
