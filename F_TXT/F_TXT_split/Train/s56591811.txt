In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there are continued low lung volumes. This accentuates the transverse diameter of the heart. The mediastinum no longer appears widened and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. Swan-Ganz catheter is in the right pulmonary artery, and the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes are in good position. There is some increased opacification in the retrocardiac region. This most likely represents atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of developing pneumonia would have to be considered.
