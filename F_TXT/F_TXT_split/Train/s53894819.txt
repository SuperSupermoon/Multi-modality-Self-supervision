AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Status post sternotomy and probably bypass surgery as before. Mild to moderate cardiac enlargement is present. Comparison with the next preceding chest examination of ___, a new permanent pacer has been placed and is seen in left anterior axillary position. The pacer is connected to two intracavitary electrodes, one of which terminates in typical right atrial position, the second one in slightly unusual high position, probably reaching the outflow tract of the right ventricle. There is no evidence of pneumothorax and no new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates can be seen. The slightly unusual high position of the right ventricular electrode will be followed up on the next coming PA and lateral chest examination to demonstrate its anterior direction.
