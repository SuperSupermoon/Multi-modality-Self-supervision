The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. A right-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter tip terminates within the proximal right atrium and at the junction of the SVC and right atrium, as before. Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. A moderate left-sided pleural effusion is minimally decreased in size from the prior examination. Left basal opacity is again demonstrated. The tip of a percutaneous gastrostomy catheter is noted in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. No pneumothorax. There is irregular lucency and compression deformity of the right humeral head, suggestive of sever degenerative changes with possible avascular necrosis.
