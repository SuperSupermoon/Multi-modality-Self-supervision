Examination limited due to patient positioning and portable technique. Left-sided PICC is in stable position, in the mid superior vena cava. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and out of the field of view. Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened when compared to the prior examination. There are bilateral effusions with overlying atelectasis versus airspace disease; mildly worsened on the right.
