There has been interval placement of a right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the distal SVC. The tracheostomy tube and feeding tube are likely unchanged in position. There is a diffuse bilateral reticulonodular interstitial process with no focal area of consolidation. These findings could reflect an atypical infectious process or interstitial edema. Clinical correlation is advised. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
