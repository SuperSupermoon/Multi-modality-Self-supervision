Comparison is made to the prior study, ___. Cardiac silhouette is obscured by lung abnormalities. Lines and tubes are in standard position. Moderate-to-large left and moderate right pleural effusions, right lower lobe consolidation, consistent with pneumonia are unchanged. Widened mediastinum due to left upper lobe mass and collapse is stable. There are no new lung abnormalities or pneumothorax.
