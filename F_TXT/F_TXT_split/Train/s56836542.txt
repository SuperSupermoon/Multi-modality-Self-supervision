The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax. An endotracheal tube terminates no less than 4.6 cm above the carina. A left PICC terminates in the mid SVC. A Dobbhoff tube terminates in the stomach and a second enteric tube enters the stomach and courses inferiorly beyond the field of view.
