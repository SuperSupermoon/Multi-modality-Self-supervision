A portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates multiple sternal wires, with the third from the top demonstrating fracturing. The endotracheal tube terminates in the mid to upper thoracic trachea, approximately 5 cm from the carina, and the enteric tube terminates in the stomach. There is no definite focal consolidation. There is mild atelectasis in the left lower lung. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated, though not optimally evaluated on supine radiograph. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
