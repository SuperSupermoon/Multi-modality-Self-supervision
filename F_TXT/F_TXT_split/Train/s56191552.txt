There has been previous median sternotomy and a mitral valve replacement procedure. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema. A questionable focal round opacity has developed in the left mid lung region at the level of the left fifth posterior rib, but is difficult to assess due to portable technique and rotation of the patient. Short-term followup radiographs, preferably with both PA and lateral technique, would be helpful for confirmation and further characterization of this finding.
