Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. Indwelling Left PIC line ends in the right atrium, no less than 2.5 cm below the estimated location of the superior cavoatrial junction. T AVR in place. Heart is not enlarged. Mediastinal contours unremarkable. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions severe left lower lobe atelectasis unchanged. External devices project over the upper lungs but I see no good evidence for pneumothorax.
