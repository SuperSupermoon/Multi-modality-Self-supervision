In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes that accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. The degree of pulmonary edema is stable, as are the bilateral pleural effusions with compressive basilar atelectasis on both sides. Opacification in the retrocardiac region is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. An area of apparent opacification just above the minor fissure laterally is not appreciated at the current time.
