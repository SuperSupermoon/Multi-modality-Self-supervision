In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been a substantial increase in subcutaneous gas along the right lateral chest wall extending into the neck. This information was conveyed to Dr.___. Right chest tube remains in place without definite pneumothorax. Indistinctness of pulmonary markings suggests some over-hydration or vascular congestion. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2 cm above the carina. Bibasilar opacifications are consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.
