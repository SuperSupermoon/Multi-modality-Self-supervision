Lung volumes are low, which has resulted in bibasilar patchy atelectasis. Apparent parenchymal abnormalities are artificially increased by the presence of pleural calcifications. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart is mildly enlarged. Prominence of the mediastinum is exacerbated by low lung volumes. Hilar contours are unremarkable.
