Single semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates in the mid trachea, in appropriate position. An esophageal catheter is also present, coursing through the gastroesophageal junction and into the stomach, out of view. Otherwise, the appearance of the chest is unchanged compared to the prior study.
