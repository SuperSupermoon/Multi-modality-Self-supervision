There has been interval improvement in the extensive subcutaneous emphysema. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. A biliary stent and several catheters are again seen overlying the right upper quadrant. A left subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. There is stable retrocardiac consolidation with associated effusion likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis. There has been some improvement in the mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. No pneumothorax is seen. The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable.
