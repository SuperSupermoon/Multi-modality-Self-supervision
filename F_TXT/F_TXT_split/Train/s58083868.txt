The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. The layering bilateral effusions are likely not changed. Associated bibasilar airspace opacity most likely reflects compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia can not be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax.
