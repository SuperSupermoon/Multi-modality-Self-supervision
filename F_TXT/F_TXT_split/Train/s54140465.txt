In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. Again there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour with atelectatic changes above it.

Although no focal consolidation is seen, in the absence of a lateral view, it is difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia.
