A nasogastric tube is seen extending below the diaphragm positioned appropriately within the stomach. The stomach demonstrates significant distention, consistent with patient's known small bowel obstruction.

There is no large pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable compared to exams dated back to at least ___.
