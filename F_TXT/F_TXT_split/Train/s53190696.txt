Compared to the prior study, the left pleural effusion is probably slightly larger. Again seen is patchy retrocardiac opacity, which may also be slightly more pronounced. There is also slight left perihilar atelectasis. Again seen is a small right pleural effusion which may be slightly improved. Minimal atelectasis in the right infrahilar region is improved. Right lung is otherwise grossly clear, without CHF or focal infiltrate. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, though partially obscured on the left. Sternotomy wires again noted. No pneumothorax detected.
