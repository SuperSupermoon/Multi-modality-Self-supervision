In comparison with study of ___, there is some increasing opacification at the right base, again consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the right lower lobe. Striking elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour is again seen. Mild atelectatic changes are seen in above it. Otherwise little change.
