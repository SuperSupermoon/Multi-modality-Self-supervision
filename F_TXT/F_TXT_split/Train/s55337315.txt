Lung volumes are slightly decreased compared to the prior exam. This causes exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette size which is likely unchanged and top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable accounting for low lung volumes. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is present. Minimal atelectasis is seen in the lung bases. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
