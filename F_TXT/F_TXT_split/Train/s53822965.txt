There has been worsening of consolidation/collapse of the left lung. Some aerated lung is still present in the left apex. There is a small left apical pneumothorax. Right lower lobe atelectasis has minimally improved. Cardiomediastinal contours are shifted to the left. Cardiomegaly cannot be assessed. Irregularity of the right proximal humerus is partially evaluated, likely related to prior trauma
