The patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 3.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, where it terminates. Allowing for technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably within normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Very vague asymmetric hazy opacity projects over the left mid lung, uncertain in significance.
