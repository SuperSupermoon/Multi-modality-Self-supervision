Low lung volumes are again noted. There is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggesting an effusion. Increased interstitial markings throughout the lungs are similar compared to prior, likely due to combination of atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes and superimposed edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Linear radiopaque density projecting over the right upper extremity.
