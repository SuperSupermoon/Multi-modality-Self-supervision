In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a right chest tube without definite pneumothorax. Subcutaneous gas is seen along the right lateral chest wall with extension into the neck. Postsurgical changes are seen in the right hemithorax, especially in the mid zone. Opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and probable small effusion. There is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
