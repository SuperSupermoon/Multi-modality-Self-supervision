There is cardiomegaly in this patient status post sternotomy. A right-sided pleural effusion. Remains substantially resolved but there is now evidence of a small right apical pneumothorax. Right-sided PICC line is in good anatomical position. Retained barium is identified in the left retrocardiac area suggesting that much of the opacity here may reflect a a hernia. Substantial left-sided effusion with extensive atelectasis is suggested. There remains significant increased attenuation throughout the lung parenchyma consistent with a diffuse ground-glass opacification is observed recent CT. This is presumptively represent of infection as per the CT though pulmonary edema or other causes need to be considered.
