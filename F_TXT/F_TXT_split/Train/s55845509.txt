A feeding tube passes at least as far as the distal stomach and perhaps through the pylorus into the distal duodenum. Imaging centered at the diaphragm may clarify the location or it may be necessary to administer air or contrast agent through the tube to highlight the duodenum anatomy. Lungs are fully expanded and clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal.
