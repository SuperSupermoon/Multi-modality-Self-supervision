As on the previous study, scatter radiation related to the size of the patient somewhat obscures the image. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged with some left ventricular prominence. No definite vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or focal consolidation. However, the area behind the enlarged heart is not evaluated adequately, and the possibility of consolidation cannot be excluded. If the condition of the patient would permit, a lateral view would be most helpful.
