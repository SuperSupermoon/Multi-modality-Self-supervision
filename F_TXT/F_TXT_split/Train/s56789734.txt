cardiomegaly cannot be assessed. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Right PICC tip is in the cavoatrial junction. There is no evident pneumothorax. Left lower lobe opacities have increased due to increasing retrocardiac atelectasis, adjacent amount of pleural effusion is probably unchanged. Right lower lobe opacity is a combination of stable moderate effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
