AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. The predescribed internal jugular vein approach wide bore catheter remains in unchanged position, terminating overlying the right atrium. High-positioned diaphragms as before conceal major portion of the heart shadow, but marked cardiac enlargement is unlikely. The previously described bilateral basal atelectatic and inflammatory lung changes are improved on the left side, but remain more on the right base where they still conceal the diaphragmatic contours. New parenchymal infiltrate occupies now diffusely the right upper lobe area, terminating the site of the right-sided minor fissure. This infiltrate was not present on the preceding examination of ___. Differentiation between fungal and bacterial process exceeds possibilities on portable single view chest examination. No pneumothorax is identified.
