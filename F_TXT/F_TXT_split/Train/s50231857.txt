In comparison with the study of ___, there is some increasing prominence of opacification at the right base and left upper zone. This could represent an unusual appearance of pulmonary edema or, in the appropriate clinical setting worsening regions of pneumonia. Increased opacification at the left base laterally is consistent with pleural effusion with basilar compression atelectasis. The opaque portion of the Dobbhoff tube is not seen, suggesting that it lies further down in the stomach below the lower margin of the image.
