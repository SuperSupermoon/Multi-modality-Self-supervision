Differentials for this appearance would include acute pulmonary edema, ARDS or extensive multifocal pneumonia. Moderate right pleural effusion, probable small left pleural effusion. Left lower lobe atelectasis. Left internal jugular and subclavian catheter is terminating in the proximal and mid SVC respectively. A tracheostomy is in-situ.
