Tracheostomy tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted with bibasilar airspace opacities which may reflect atelectasis. Infection, particularly in the left lung base, cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is clearly seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities identified. An apparent right-sided PICC appears coiled within the right axillary region.
