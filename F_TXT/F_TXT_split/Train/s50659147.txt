A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes with increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. There are persistent bilateral opacities, consistent with pulmonary edema. There are likely unchanged bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified. A right PICC again terminates within the upper right atrium. The patient has been extubated, with mild narrowing of the superior trachea.
