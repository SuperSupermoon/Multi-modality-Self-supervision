Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates hyperexpanded lungs. Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis larger on the right have markedly decreased in size. There is mild vascular congestion superimposed on a background of chronic interstitial changes. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Left apical loculated hydro-pneumothorax and apical consolidation are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
