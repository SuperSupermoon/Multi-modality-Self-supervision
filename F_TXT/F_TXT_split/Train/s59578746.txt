As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a new opacity at the right lung base that obscures the heart border and the right hemidiaphragm. The opacity is likely caused by a combination of effusion and atelectasis. The opacity occupies about one-third of the right hemithorax. Marked cardiomegaly with borderline diameter of the pulmonary vascular structures, potentially indicative of mild fluid overload. No evidence of left-sided effusion. Left pectoral pacemaker in situ.
