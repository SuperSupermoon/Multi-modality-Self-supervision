A right subclavian infusion port ends in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. Rightward mediastinal shift, elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and the appearance of the right infrahilar lung suggests substantial lower lobe atelectasis. Atelectasis in the left lower lung is less severe. Pleural effusions are small if any.
