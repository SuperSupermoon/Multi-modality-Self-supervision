CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. The right-sided chest tube is in place, at the lung base, lying lateral to the vertical midline of the right lung. A small right effusion is present, similar, possibly slightly increased, compared with ___ at 3:27 a.m. Otherwise, no significant interval change is detected. Again seen is marked cardiomegaly. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF, likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Possible small left effusion. Patchy and somewhat alveolar opacity at both bases noted, consistent with lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. The possibility of an associated pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded. Right dual-lumen catheter present, with both tips over right atrium. The appearance remains grossly similar to films dated ___ at 3:36 a.m.
