1. Stable mediastinal contours in this patient status post esophagogastrectomy with the nasogastric tube projecting in an unchanged position. A mediastinal drain remains in place. A right chest tube remains in place and the tiny right apical pneumothorax is stable. However, there is increasing bibasilar airspace opacity along with perihilar congestion and layering bilateral effusions. These findings together likely reflect interval development of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis is also likely given the pleural effusions. Overall, cardiac size is stable.
