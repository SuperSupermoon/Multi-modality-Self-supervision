In comparison with the study of ___, there again are extremely low lung volumes. Opacification at the left base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Less prominent changes are seen at the right base. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Given the low lung volumes and basilar changes, in the appropriate setting it would be extremely difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
