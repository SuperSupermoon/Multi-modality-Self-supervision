Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.6 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, the inferior aspect not included in the image. There are low lung volumes. There are areas of patchy opacity in left perihilar and left basilar regions as well as in the right paratracheal right upper lobe/paramediastinal region which could be due to aspiration and/or infection. Depending on the history, underlying trauma/pulmonary contusion not entirely excluded. There is also minimal right basilar opacity which could be due to additional site of consolidation. No large pleural effusion is seen, although small pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. Mediastinal contours are smooth and likely accentuated by supine, AP technique and low lung volumes. No displaced fracture is identified.
