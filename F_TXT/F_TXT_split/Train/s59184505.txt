As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain very low. Platelike atelectasis is present at the right lung basis and a rather extensive left lower lobe atelectasis is again visualized. A area of pleural thickening on the left is more extensive than on the previous examination. This might be caused by reaccumulating pleural effusion. No pneumonia, no pneumothorax.
