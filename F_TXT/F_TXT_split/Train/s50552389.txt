Endotracheal tube terminates in standard position, approximately 4.5 cm from the carina. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. An enteric tube and side port are within the stomach. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is re- demonstrated. Focal opacities are seen within the retrocardiac region as well as ill-defined nodular opacities within the right mid lung field. These may reflect areas of developing infection. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam.
