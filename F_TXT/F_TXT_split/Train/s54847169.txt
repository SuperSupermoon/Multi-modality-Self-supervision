In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued bilateral pulmonary opacifications especially involving the lower lungs. Again this most likely reflects substantial pulmonary edema, though the possibility of supervening consolidation can certainly not be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. The overall opacification at the left base appears to be somewhat improved since the prior study.
