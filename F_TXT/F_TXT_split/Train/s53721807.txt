The lungs are well expanded. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Known mediastinal and hilar nodes are not well appreciated radiographically. Left-sided pacemaker with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle noted. Multiple nodules an opacities seen on the chest CT from ___ are poorly visualized by radiograph. On today's exam, there is a faint small patchy opacity in the right mid zone laterally, above a slightly thickened minor fissure; some patchy opacity at the right base, with blunting of the right costophrenic angle ; and minimal patchy opacity at the left base. Findings at the right base are more pronounced and could represent early superimposed pneumonic infiltrate. The right midzone left base opacities are similar to the prior film. The prominent rounded density previously seen over the right lower lung is no longer visualized and, itself, may have represented a nipple shadow.
