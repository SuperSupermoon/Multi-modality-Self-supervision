There is new complete opacification of the right hemi thorax with rightward shift of mediastinal structures, findings compatible with right lung collapse. There is likely a right-sided pleural effusion as well, but not well delineated from the right lung collapse. Previously demonstrated right basilar pneumonia is not well assessed. Heart size is difficult to evaluate but likely unchanged. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Left lung is hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted. A small left pleural effusion is not substantially changed. No left-sided focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium right ventricle. Right PICC tip terminates in the upper SVC.
