As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube was removed. As a consequence, the lung volumes have decreased, making the pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis and the opacity in the right upper lobe appears slightly denser than on the previous image. There is unchanged mild to moderate pulmonary edema. The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded, given blunting of the left costophrenic sinus. No pneumothorax.
