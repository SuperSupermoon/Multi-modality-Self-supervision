Monitoring leads overlie the chest. Nasogastric tube tip is in the distal esophagus to the right of midline. The right upper lobe nodule described on the earlier study is difficult to visualize, possibly due to overlying monitoring leads. The esophageal stent is not well seen likely due to technique. Correlation with recent procedures would be recommended. There is upper zone redistribution and blurring of vascular detail suggesting mild CHF. There is no dense consolidation or pneumothorax.
