Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates near-complete resolution of the left pleural effusion. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion persists with associated thickening of the right minor fissure, likely due to pleural fluid. There is no pneumothorax. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Heart size is top normal. Mild pulmonary edema persists. Right PIC catheter tip projects over mid SVC.
