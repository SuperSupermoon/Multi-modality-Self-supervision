Upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, with low lung volumes bilaterally. There is unchanged displacement of the trachea towards the right secondary to a very tortuous intrathoracic aorta. The heart is borderline enlarged in size, unchanged since the prior study. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. There is no evidence of subdiaphragmatic free air. No pneumothorax is present.
