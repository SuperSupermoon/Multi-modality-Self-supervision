Overlying trauma board limits assessment. An endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating at the level of the carina. An enteric tube is coiled within the hypopharynx with side port in the proximal esophagus and tip in the mid esophagus. Lung volumes are low. There is moderate to severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette. Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to low lung volumes and supine positioning. Bilateral hazy ill-defined opacities may reflect moderate pulmonary edema though superimposed infection is not excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. No displaced fractures are visualized.
