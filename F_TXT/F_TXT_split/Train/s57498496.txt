There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating in the proximal to mid SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, likely exaggerated by AP technique. There is minimal left apical pleural thickening/ calcification. There is minor left basilar atelectasis/ scarring. There is a tubular structure projecting over the lateral left upper abdomen, unclear whether this is external or internal to the patient.
