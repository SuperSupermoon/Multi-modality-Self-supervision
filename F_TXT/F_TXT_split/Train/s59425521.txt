1. Endotracheal tube and left subclavian central line unchanged in position. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Heart remains stably enlarged. The aorta is somewhat unfolded and tortuous. There is increasing perihilar prominence and indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature, which suggests a component of mild perihilar edema. In addition, more patchy opacity at the right base is seen, which could represent worsening atelectasis, although a developing pneumonia should also be considered. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
