Pulmonary vascular congestion which developed on ___ has improved, but not cleared. Mediastinal veins are more engorged today and mild cardiomegaly is more pronounced than before suggesting increase in central venous pressure or volume or both. Severe left lower lobe atelectasis is still present. Previous small bilateral pleural effusions and right basal atelectasis have improved. No pneumothorax. Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 5 cm from the carina. Since the chin is elevated the ET tube does not have to be advanced but care should be taken not to withdraw if any further.
