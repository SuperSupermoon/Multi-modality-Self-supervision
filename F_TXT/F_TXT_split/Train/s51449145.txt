NG tube ends in mildly distended upper stomach. Mild cardiomegaly is chronic. Aeration of the lung bases is compromised, by atelectasis reflecting elevation of the diaphragm. Pneumonia is not excluded of course. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial in size. There is no pneumothorax. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses.
