Comparison is made to prior study from 12 hours earlier. There are again seen diffuse areas of consolidation throughout both lobes, most prominent within the right upper lobe marginating the middle fissure. There is again seen a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the distal SVC. This has been pulled back 2 to 3 cm as suggested. There is a left left-sided pleural effusion, unchanged. There are no pneumothoraces.
