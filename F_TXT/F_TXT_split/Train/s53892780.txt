Lung volumes are lower and mild peribronchial opacification has developed in the both lower lobes. Whether this is atelectasis, aspiration, or developing pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate. The heart is moderately enlarged and upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is engorged but there is no edema. Pleural effusion is small on the left if any. No pneumothorax.
