Single portable view of the chest. Again seen are bibasilar opacities, more extensive on the left than on the right which silhouettes the left hemidiaphragm. These are likely in part due to effusions noting underlying consolidation/atelectasis are also possible. Superiorly, the lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable noting unchanged cardiomegaly. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
