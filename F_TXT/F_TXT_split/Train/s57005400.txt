Subtle increase in opacity projecting over the left lung base may relate to overlying soft tissue and is similar in appearance as compared to the scout view from abdomen/pelvis CT from ___. There is mild left base atelectasis. No definite focal consolidation is seen, although PA and lateral views would be helpful for better and further evaluation. The right lung is clear. There is no large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
