Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is interval placement of a right-sided chest tube. Right-sided pneumothorax is no longer well apparent, decreased in the interval. Right base atelectasis is again seen along with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Subcutaneous emphysema along the right-sided chest wall and tracking in the right supraclavicular region is partially imaged. Left lung is clear. No large pleural effusion is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
