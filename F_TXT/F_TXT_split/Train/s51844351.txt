In comparison to previous radiograph from earlier today, a left pleural catheter has been placed, partially obscured by the VAD. Left pleural effusion is not appreciably changed radiographically, and there is no visible pneumothorax on this semi upright radiograph. Widespread pulmonary opacities involving the left lung to a greater degree than the right have slightly worsened. No other relevant change.
