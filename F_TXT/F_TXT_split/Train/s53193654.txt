AP view of the chest. There is an approximate 6 cm cc x at least 3.5 cm TRV rounded density projecting over the right hilum, potentially posterior in location worrisome for underlying mass. The lungs are otherwise clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for technique. Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the arch. The lung calcific density projects over the left chest wall. Degenerative changes seen at the shoulders.
