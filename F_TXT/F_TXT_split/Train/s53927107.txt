A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends 5.8 cm above the carina. The upper enteric tube follows the expected course, ending below the diaphragm, although the tip is not visualized. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal allowing for lung volumes.
