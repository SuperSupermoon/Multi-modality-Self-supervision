A single portable semi-erect frontal view of the chest demonstrates a skin fold projecting over the left hemithorax. The appearance of the chest is otherwise unchanged from the preceding study of five hours prior without pneumothorax, pleural effusion or focal consolidation. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. The aorta is markedly tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
