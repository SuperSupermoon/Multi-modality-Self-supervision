No previous images. A right bronchial stent is in place and there is no evidence of postprocedure pneumothorax. There is increased opacification at the right base without silhouetting of the heart border or definitely the right hemi diaphragm. This could be related to volume loss associated with a central bronchial lesion in the right hilum. The left lung is essentially clear.
