The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature shows upper zone redistribution with indistinct margins suggesting mild vascular congestion. There is also more focal but vague patchy opacification at the left lung base, the latter possibly atelectasis. There is no definite pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate right-sided diaphragmatic elevation appears similar.
