ET tube is 6 cm above the carina but remains below the thoracic inlet. An enteric tube terminates within the stomach. A right PICC line is seen terminating in the mid superior vena cava. The lungs are hyperexpanded. Improved haziness at the lung bases compatible with resolving pleural effusions. Small bilateral pleural effusions persist. Pleural calcifications are again noted. There is no pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
