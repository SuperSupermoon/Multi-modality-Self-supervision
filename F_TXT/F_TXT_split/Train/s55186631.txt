Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates the ET tube is 3 cm above the carina. Otherwise there is little overall change in the appearance of the chest other than lower lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. Pulmonary vascular congestion persists. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
