Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. A questionable area of increased opacity is observed in the right apex medially above the right clavicle, difficult to assess due to the patient's rotation and projectional factors. Attention to this region on a repeat radiograph with standard positioning would be helpful to differentiate superimposition of structures from a true lung abnormality such as an acute focus of aspiration. Lungs are otherwise clear except for linear atelectasis in the retrocardiac region.
