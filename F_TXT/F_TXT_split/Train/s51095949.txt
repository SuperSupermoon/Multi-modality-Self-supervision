A right subclavian PICC line is present, tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. There is mild cardiomegaly. The aorta is calcified and slightly unfolded. No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is identified. Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, calcified granulomas, or apical fibronodular spurring is identified. There are probable degenerative changes of the thoracic spine, not well evaluated on these films. There does appear to be superior endplate scalloping of the presumptive T7 vertebral body, slightly more pronounced on the chest radiograph dated ___. Compared with the most recent prior study, I doubt significant interval change.
