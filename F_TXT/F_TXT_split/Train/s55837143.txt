Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable mild cardiomegaly. Apparent widening of the mediastinum is related to patient rotation. Left-sided central venous catheter with tip at the distal SVC. Endotracheal tube is in standard position. Nasogastric tube, seen coiled in oropharynx on next preceding study, is seen passing into stomach and out of view with the side port not definitively seen. Interval increased opacification of the bilateral lung bases is likely a combination of worsening atelectasis and pleural effusion. Stable minimally asymmetrically increased density of the right middle lobe corresponds with area of increased atelectasis on the ___ CT. No pneumothorax evident.
