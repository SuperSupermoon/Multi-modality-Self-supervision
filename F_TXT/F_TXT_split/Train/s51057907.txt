Since the previous study, the pulmonary vasculature has become more ill-defined consistent with interval appearance of mild interstitial edema. Bibasilar patchy opacities have also slightly increased favoring lower lobe patchy atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi upright technique. No large effusions.
