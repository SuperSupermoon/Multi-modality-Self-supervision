Left subclavian central line tip overlies the proximal SVC. Tubing noted over left upper abdomen, not fully evaluated. Compared to the prior film, there is minimal interval change. Again seen are increased interstitial markings, with more confluent alveolar areas, likely reflecting CHF. No gross effusions are identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for differences in technique.
