Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiac size is top normal. Widened mediastinum due to engorgement of the vessels is stable. Mild pulmonary edema has minimally increased. Increasing opacities in the right lower lobe could be due to atelectasis, part of the edema, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded and attention on a followup study is recommended. There is no pneumothorax/pleural effusions.
