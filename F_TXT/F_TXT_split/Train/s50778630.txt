There is an orogastric tube whose side port is above the GE junction. This could be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal placement. The endotracheal tube is at the level of the aortic knob appropriately sited. There is some coarsening of bronchovascular markings without overt pulmonary edema, focal consolidation or pleural effusions. No pneumothoraces are seen.
