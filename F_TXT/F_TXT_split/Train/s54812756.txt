AP upright portable chest radiograph provided. A PICC line is again seen with right upper extremity access and the tip at the level of the mid SVC. An NG tube courses into the left upper quadrant. Clips are noted in the upper abdomen. The heart appears top normal in size, though this could be due to technical factors. Subtle perihilar opacities could represent bronchovascular crowding though the possibility of mild edema is not excluded. No large effusion is seen, though the right CP angle is partially excluded. No pneumothorax is present. Bony structures appear intact.
