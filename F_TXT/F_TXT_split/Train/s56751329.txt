The cardiac silhouette is stably, mildly enlarged. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Pulmonary edema is overall stable since prior examination, but the other the signs of cardiac decompensation - pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement- are improving. More confluent opacity is seen in the bilateral infrahilar regions, right greater than left. Though these may be related to the underlying pulmonary edema, infection is not excluded. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
