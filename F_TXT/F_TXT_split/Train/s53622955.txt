Following recent right thoracentesis, a right pleural effusion has decreased in size, with residual moderate right pleural effusion, which appears partially loculated. A small lucency within the area of pleural fluid may reflect a small loculated hydropneumothorax, but there is no substantial apical pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Bibasilar areas of atelectasis have slightly improved since the previous study. Small left pleural effusion is also demonstrated.
