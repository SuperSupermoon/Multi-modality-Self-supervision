Status post removal of a right chest tube and of mediastinal drains. A pre-existing small pleural effusion on the left has slightly increased, with an associated increase in extent of retrocardiac atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. On the right, there is a minimal zone of increased opacity projecting over the right costophrenic sinus. This might be atelectatic in origin, but must undergo short-term radiographic followup to rule out early pneumonia.
