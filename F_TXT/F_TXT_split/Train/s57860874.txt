AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has both increased and changed in distribution since ___, with a growing right fissural component and a likely paramediastinal component simulating widening of the mediastinum in the right paratracheal region, rather than mediastinal hematoma which would tend to displace the trachea and/or the right internal jugular line. If there is clinical concern about mediastinal hematoma, CT scanning would be definitive, although an attempted right decubitus chest radiograph carefully positioned might show migration of the paramediastinal pleural fluid collection that we see on these conventional chest radiographs. Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged. Left pleural effusion is small if any. Left lower lobe atelectasis is longstanding. No pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Dr. ___ was paged.
