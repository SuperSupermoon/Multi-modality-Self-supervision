AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 12:32 p.m.: Large area of consolidation at the right lung base has been stable since ___, and there is new peribronchial consolidation on the left lateral to the large partially fluid-filled gastrointestinal midline hernia. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. The upper lungs are clear, and relatively mild vascular engorgement in the upper lungs is not a good indication of cardiac dysfunction, given the severe pneumonia elsewhere. Heart size is top normal. Entire GI tract is severely distended with gas simulating pneumoperitoneum. If there is concern for free peritoneal gas then left decubitus view of the right diaphragmatic region is recommended. No pneumothorax.
