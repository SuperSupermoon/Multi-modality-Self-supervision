Endotracheal tube is in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Airspace opacity of the opacities in the right mid and lower lung appear similar, but there is interval worsening of opacity in the left retrocardiac region, which may be due to an additional site of consolidation and/or atelectasis. Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged as well as right apical pleural and parenchymal scarring.
