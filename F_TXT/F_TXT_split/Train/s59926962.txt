Endotracheal tube has again migrated upward with distal chamber terminating at the level of the carina. The more proximal chamber appears to end at the level of the clavicles. Linear lucencies identifed along the upper mediastinum as well as the right heart border suggests pneumomediastinum. Please correlate with recent instrumentation. Faint multifocal opacifications evident in the left lower lung and aerated portions of the right middle lung may represent edema versus hemorrhage. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Stable right lower lung colapse in a patient with preferential intubation of left lung. Improved aeration of the left lower lung.
