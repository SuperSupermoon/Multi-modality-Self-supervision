Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The left chest tube has been repositioned with its tip currently projecting over the apex. The right lower lobe atelectasis appears to be minimally improved, but there is a substantial amount of consolidation, thus aspiration is a possibility. NG tube tip is in the stomach. The ET tube tip is 7.5 cm above the carina.
