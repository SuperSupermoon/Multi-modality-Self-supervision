In comparison with study of ___, there is a chest tube in place on the right with no evidence of pneumothorax. Lower lung volumes are seen. There is increased opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. There is engorgement of ill-defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with volume overload.
