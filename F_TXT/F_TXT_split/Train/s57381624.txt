The new endotracheal tube tip projects 1.4 cm above the carina and should be withdrawn at least 2 cm for optimal placement. The large left infrahilar consolidation is worse, with increased opacification of the left lung. There is associated leftward mediastinal shift and a more superiorly displaced left lower lobe bronchus. Findings suggest possible left upper a lingual collapse with left basal atelectasis and left-sided effusion.
