A left pectoral pacemaker is noted with leads in the standard position. There are bilateral basilar opacities, likely combination of small pleural effusions and atelectasis. Superimposed infection would be difficult to exclude. There is mild pulmonary edema. Heart size is probably enlarged but difficult to fully assess given the parenchymal abnormalities. No pneumothorax.
