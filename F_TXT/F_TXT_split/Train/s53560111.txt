The left-sided PICC terminates deep in the right atrium and could be retracted approximately 5 cm to lie in the distal SVC. An ET tube is appropriate position an enteric tube extends into the stomach. No pneumothorax identified. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Again seen is an opacity in the left lower lobe obscuring the left hemidiaphragm and left heart border consistent with left lower lung collapse. The opacity at the right base medially is more prominent and a pneumonia cannot be excluded in this location. Again seen is the rounded density projecting over the lateral right midzone which when compared to the prior exam appears to lie outside of the lung.
