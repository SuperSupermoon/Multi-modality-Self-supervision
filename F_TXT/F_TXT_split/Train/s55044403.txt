In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with increasing pulmonary vascular congestion. In addition, there is substantial increase in opacification at the right base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm,.

The left hemidiaphragm is silhouetted, suggesting pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
