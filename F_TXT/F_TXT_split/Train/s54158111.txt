Portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates apical lordotic positioning and low lung volumes. Allowing for these limitations, again seen is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with a stable-appearing left retrocardiac opacity. The right lung appears clear. No significant pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
