Given differences in technique, there has been no significant interval change. Right suprahilar opacity there is a least in part due to radiation fibrosis. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are again seen as well as more dense retrocardiac opacity, potentially atelectasis. Right basal pleural catheter is again noted. There is no new focal consolidation. Cardiomediastinal silhouettes within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
