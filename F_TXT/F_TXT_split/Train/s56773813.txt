Comparison is made with prior study ___. ET tube is seen slightly high, 7 cm above the carina, could be advanced couple of centimeters for more standard position. Dobhoff tube tip is in the stomach. Left PICC tip is in the cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. A small left effusion is new or newly apparent. vascular congestion has improved. Right pleural effusion has improved. Left perihilar and left lower lobe opacities have increased, worrisome for pneumonia. Right lower lobe opacities are stable, could be atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Hardware in the cervical spine is partially imaged.
