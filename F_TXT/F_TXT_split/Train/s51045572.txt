AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Pulmonary edema, somewhat asymmetrically distributed on ___ improved substantially overnight, and mild interstitial edema persists, slightly greater in the left lung than the right. Opacification at the lung bases is probably a combination of atelectasis and dependent edema. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not appreciable in size. Cardiac size has decreased substantially over the past two days. Tracheostomy tube and left subclavian central venous line and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements. Cuff of the tracheostomy tube mildly distends the trachea. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion is present.
