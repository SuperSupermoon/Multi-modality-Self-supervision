As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities, left more than right, with air bronchograms. Moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral basal areas of atelectasis. Mild widening of the right aspects of the mediastinum, suggesting fluid overload. None of the changes are substantially different than on the previous image.
