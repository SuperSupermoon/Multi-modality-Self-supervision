AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The position of the left-sided PICC line has changed and apparently pullback of the line was small, the tip still projects into the upper third of the right atrial contour. From the present position, pull back by 5 cm will bring the tip just below the carina, which would indicate the mid portion of the SVC. Otherwise, the chest films do not show any interval difference. Dr. ___ was paged at 4:30 p.m.
