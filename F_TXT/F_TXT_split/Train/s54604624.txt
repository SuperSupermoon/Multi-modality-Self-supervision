AP chest compared to 12:46 a.m.: Atelectasis in the right middle lobe is new, but what was probably an atypical right upper lobe collapse has resolved. Postoperative contour of the mediastinum is stable, no longer suggestive of active bleeding. Swan-Ganz catheter has been advanced to the right pulmonary artery. Mild pulmonary edema in the left lung is new. Pneumothorax, if present, is not appreciable, difficult to exclude in this image of the supine patient, particularly with an increase in the severity of extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall, upper abdomen and now both sides of the neck. ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric drainage catheter passes into the stomach and out of view. Pneumoperitoneum persists. Heart size normal, though slightly larger than earlier postoperatively. No right pneumothorax. Probable small right pleural effusion increased since earlier.
