As compared to the previous radiograph, the right apical paramediastinal opacity has increased in size and has a more pronounced contour. In addition, opacities in the right lower lobe have newly developed, likely reflecting post-obstructive pneumonia. The right hilus is slightly enlarged, potentially reflecting right hilar lymphadenopathy. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions. Normal appearing remaining lung parenchyma. No evidence of pneumothorax.
