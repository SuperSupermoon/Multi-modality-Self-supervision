AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is again noted. No typical configurational abnormality is present, and the enlargement appears to take care equally in both ventricles and atria. No evidence of increased pulmonary congestion as patient presents in semi-upright position. No evidence of pleural effusion in the lateral pleural sinuses and no pneumothorax in the apical area. Previously described permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position connected to an ICD line continues to terminate in the apical portion of the right ventricle. A new right internal jugular approach sheath has been used to advance a Swan-Ganz catheter which is seen to pass through the dilated right atrium into the enlarged right ventricle and approaches in the central portion of the right lower pulmonary artery. There is no significant interval change with regard to heart size and pulmonary vascular appearance in comparison with the previous PA and lateral chest examination of ___. A chest CT of ___ ruled out pulmonary embolism. The findings of moderately enlarged cardiac chambers are noted, but functional aspect of the cardiomyopathy in this case would benefit from a dynamic cardiac analysis which has not been performed.
