Supine portable AP view of the chest provided. A nasogastric tube descends into the upper abdomen with its tip excluded from view. The heart appears mildly enlarged allowing for technique. The retrocardiac region is poorly assessed, though there is no convincing sign of pneumonia or aspiration. Mild hilar engorgement is likely present. No supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax.
