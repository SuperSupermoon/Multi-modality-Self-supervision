Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous, unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise stable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Patchy opacities in the lung bases are minimally worse compared to the prior exam, and likely reflect areas of atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude in the correct clinical setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine with multilevel degenerative changes are again demonstrated.
