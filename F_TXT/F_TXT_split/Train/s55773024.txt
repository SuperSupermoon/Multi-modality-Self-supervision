As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change in appearance of the endotracheal tube. The tip continues to project approximately 3.8 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube shows an unchanged course. A venous introduction sheath on the right is now noted. Moderate cardiomegaly. Mild pulmonary edema. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinuses, so that the presence of minimal pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
