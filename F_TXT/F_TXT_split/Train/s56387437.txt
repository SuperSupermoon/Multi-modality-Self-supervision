The previously noted tiny biapical pneumothoraces are not well visualized on the current study, although may be obscured by overlapping structures. There is likely a small pleural effusion on the right, given blunting of the right costophrenic angle. No sizable pleural effusion on the left. Bibasilar atelectasis is similar. No other consolidation. Heart size is normal. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is only partially imaged.
