In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed. Left chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence pneumothorax. Continued extensive subcutaneous gas, which has not appreciably increased since the previous study. Substantial bilateral effusions, especially on the right, with volume loss in the right lower lobe. There is a curious opacification along the low lower left lateral chest wall. This could represent a small loculated if fusion.
