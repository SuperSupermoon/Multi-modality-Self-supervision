Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen and enteric feeding tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. Temporary pacer is seen extending into the right ventricle. Moderate pulmonary edema is grossly stable. There are small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with overlying atelectasis. There is persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Mediastinal contours are stable. There is slight decrease in opacity at the right lung base which may be due to different distribution of the right pleural effusion with differences in patient positioning.
