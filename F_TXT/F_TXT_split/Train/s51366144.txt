Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax consistent with complete right lung collapse around a large central hilar mass. Again seen is probable narrowing of the right mainstem bronchus and persistent rightward shift of the mediastinum. Interval increase in pulmonary congestion in the left lung. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing into the stomach and out of the field of view. No pneumothorax.
