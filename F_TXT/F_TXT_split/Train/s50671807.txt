ET tube ends 7.3 cm above the carina. NG tube which was repositioned in the stomach. Right jugular catheter sheath is in adequate position, ending in upper SVC. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Left lower lobe collapse is still severe and not significantly changed since yesterday considering the different positioning. The hazy opacification of the left lung is probably due to overlying pleural effusion.
