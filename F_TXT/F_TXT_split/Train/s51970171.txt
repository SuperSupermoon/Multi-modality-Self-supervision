Diffuse alveolar opacities are new and greater on the left compared to the right. Though findings are typical for pulmonary edema, given the distribution and chronic appearance as compared to multiple prior CTs, consideration should be given to other causes, possibly a fulminant allergic or toxic alveolitis. No large pleural effusions are evident. Mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. No pneumothorax is evident.
