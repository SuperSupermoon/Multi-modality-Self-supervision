As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been minimally pulled back. However, the tube is still very close to the orifice of the right main bronchus and should be pulled back by another 1 cm to avoid right bronchial intubation. No other changes. The course of the nasogastric tube is constant.
