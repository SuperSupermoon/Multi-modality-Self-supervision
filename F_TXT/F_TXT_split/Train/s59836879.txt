Single semi-erect frontal view of the chest demonstrates persistent prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette, likely accentuated by low lung volumes and AP technique. There is persistent vascular engorgement, and bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis. Allowing for slight technical differences, upper lung aeration does not appear substantially changed, certainly not significantly improved. A left-sided PICC has tip terminating approximately 3 cm below the carina, unchanged.
