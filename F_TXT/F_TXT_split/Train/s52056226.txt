Comparison is made with prior study performed earlier the same day in the morning. Right lower lobe and left perihilar opacities consistent with infection/likely aspiration pneumonia are stable. Small left pleural effusion is new or newly apparent. Left lower lobe opacities have minimally increased consistent with pneumonia an/or atelectasis. ET tube is high, 12 cm above the carina, should be advanced at least 5 cm for more standard position. Enteric tube tip is at the level of the clavicles in the upper esophagus, should be advanced for more standard position. Right subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
