There has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube which projects over the trachea and appears to enter the left mainstem bronchus in course inferiorly, presumably penetrating the diaphragm and with distal tip projecting over the mid left abdomen. There is a large left pneumothorax with rightward shift of mediastinal structures. There is stable position of right-sided port with distal tip projecting over cavoatrial junction. Allowing for changes due to mediastinal shift, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The bilateral hila are not well visualized. The left lung is collapsed against the left mediastinum secondary to large pneumothorax. The right lung is clear without evidence of focal consolidation. There is no right pneumothorax. There are no pleural effusions.
