As compared to the previous image, the patient has received a Dobbhoff catheter. The tip of the catheter projects over the middle part of the stomach. There is no evidence of complications such as pneumothorax. The lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation, with subsequent decrease in extent and severity of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities. The hemodialysis catheter and the Swan-Ganz catheter as well as the sternal wires are unchanged.
