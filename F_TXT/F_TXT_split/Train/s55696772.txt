In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube, with its tip approximately 2 cm above the foramen. There are substantially lower lung volumes. Increased opacification at the left base most likely reflects atelectasis and possible small effusion. Atelectatic changes are also seen at the left base. There is engorgement of pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
