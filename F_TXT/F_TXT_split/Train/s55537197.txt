ET tube is 4.6 cm above the carina. Three left-sided chest tubes are in place with removal of the smaller gauge left-sided chest tube. The mediastinum is markedly widened compared to prior likely due to a combination of both vascular engorgement and some bleeding. There is a moderate left effusion layering posteriorly and medially. There is dense retrocardiac opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion.
