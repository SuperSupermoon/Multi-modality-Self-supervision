Endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm from the carina. Enteric tube and side port are within the stomach. Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears mildly enlarged. Apparent widening of the superior mediastinal contour also is likely due to low lung volumes. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy and linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
