Enteric tube ext extends beneath the diaphragm with tip overlying stomach. Dual-lumen right subclavian line is present, with distal tip over right atrium. PICC line present. Tip obscured, but likely overlying mid/ distal SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Compared to the prior film, there is increased vascular plethora, consistent with increased CHF. Retrocardiac density again seen, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and probable small effusion. Patchy opacity at the right lung base remains visible.
