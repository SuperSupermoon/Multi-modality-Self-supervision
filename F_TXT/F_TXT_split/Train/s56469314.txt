Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement are chronic. Focal opacification at the lung bases could be combination of atelectasis and early edema, but cannot be distinguished from aspiration or even early pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion is stable. Enlargement of head neck vessels and the right lobe of the thyroid gland explain deviation of the trachea in the lower neck and upper mediastinum. No pneumothorax.
