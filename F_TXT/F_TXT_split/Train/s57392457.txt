Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size for technique and accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. A wedge-shaped area of opacity in the right juxtahilar region has slightly progressed in the interval, and is now accompanied by a poorly-defined opacity at the right lung base and patchy and linear opacities in the left base. Observed findings may represent multifocal pneumonia coexisting with atelectasis.
