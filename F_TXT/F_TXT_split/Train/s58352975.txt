The ET tube is 3 cm above the carina. There is a left subclavian line with tip in the SVC. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right and volume loss in both bases. An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded. There is mild pulmonary vascular re-distribution with perihilar alveolar infiltrate. The overall impression is that of pulmonary edema which is worse compared to films from the prior day.
