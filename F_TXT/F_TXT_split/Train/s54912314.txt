Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates that the left PICC has been retracted and now lies in the upper segment of the SVC. The study is otherwise unchanged, including atelectasis of the right lower lobe and left lingula, as well as chronic left lower lobe collapse. There is no pneumothorax or effusion.
