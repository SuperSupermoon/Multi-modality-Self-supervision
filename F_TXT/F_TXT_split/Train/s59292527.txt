Single portable view of the chest. No prior. Endotracheal tube tip is seen approximately 5.0 cm from the carina. The lungs are grossly clear. Given patient's apical lordotic positioning, cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly within normal limits. Deformity of the left chest wall suggests prior left-sided rib fractures.
