As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a decrease in severity of the pre-existing left lower lung parenchymal opacity. The opacity, however, is still clearly visible and shows a lateral atelectatic and medial consolidative component. The preexisting atelectasis in the upper to mid zones of the left lung is unremarkable. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No acute lung changes. Degenerative changes in the right shoulder, status post partial shoulder replacement on the left.
