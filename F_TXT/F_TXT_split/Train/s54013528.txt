Again demonstrated are calcified pleural plaques more pronounced within the right hemithorax, compatible with a prior history of asbestos exposure. Lung volumes are reduced. The heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is moderate pulmonary edema which appears similar when compared to the prior exam. Patchy opacities in the lung bases appear slightly progressed in the right lung base, and may reflect areas of worsening atelectasis though infection is not excluded. Consolidation within the left upper lobe is chronic. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also noted. No pneumothorax is identified. Mildly displaced acute fracture of the left proximal humerus is re- demonstrated. Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine are noted.
