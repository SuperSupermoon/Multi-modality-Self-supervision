As compared to the previous radiograph, an upright portable radiograph is performed. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The patient is after right thoracocentesis. The evidence of mild fluid overload and the increased opacity at the right lung apex is constant. Minimal left pleural effusion with atelectasis. Unchanged left PICC line, unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
