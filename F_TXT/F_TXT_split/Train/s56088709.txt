Compared with earlier chest radiograph, there has been re-expansion of the left lung status post left-sided chest tube placement. There is still residual pneumothorax and continued opacification of the left lower lung causing silhouette of the left heart, consistent with persistent left-sided pleural effusion. The right lung is grossly clear. Although the left-sided chest tube appears mildly kinked at its skin entry site in the left thorax, according to the emergency room physician, it is draining well.
