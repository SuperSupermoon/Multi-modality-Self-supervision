A single portable upright AP chest radiograph is limited by low lung volumes which accentuates the pulmonary vasculature. Right basilar opacity is likely due to atelectasis. Crowding of pulmonary vasculature is noted. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by low lung volumes. The thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous. Cholecystectomy clips are noted in the right upper quadrant. There is gaseous distention of colon and/or stomach in the left upper quadrant.
