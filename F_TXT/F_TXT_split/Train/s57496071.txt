The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Mild to moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The aortic knob remains calcified. There is worsening pulmonary edema which is now mild in extent. A moderate to large right pleural effusion appears relatively unchanged compared to the prior exam. There is continued right basilar opacification which may reflect compressive atelectasis though underlying infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is identified, and a left-sided pleural effusion is not noted.
