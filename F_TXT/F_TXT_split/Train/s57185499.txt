Rotated positioning. As before, there is cardiomegaly. Direct comparison for any increase in cardiac size is difficult due to rotated positioning and technical differences. The possibility of some interval increase in the degree of cardiac enlargement cannot be excluded. As before, as well, the aorta is calcified and unfolded. There is a possible small right effusion as well as some atelectasis and scarring at the right base superimposed on a known elevated right hemidiaphragm. Possibility of some interval worsening of these findings cannot be excluded. There is new increased retrocardiac density with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. No gross left effusion. Left apical pleural thickening is more apparent on the current film.
