A pigtail pleural catheter has been removed and replaced by two left-sided chest tubes. A large left pleural effusion has been evacuated with a small amount of residual loculated fluid or thickening as well as a moderate-sized left pneumothorax at the site of previous large effusion. The left lung is only partially reexpanded. Right lung and pleural surfaces are clear. Destructive and partially sclerotic lesion of the right clavicle is again demonstrated, concerning for metastatic disease in this patient with history of breast cancer.
