Single frontal chest radiograph was performed. There appears to be a guidewire within the nasogastric tube. Weighted nasogastric tube is present, with the tip within the stomach. There is not significant redundancy of tubing within the stomach to indicate that this would spontaneously be pulled into the duodenum unless the tube is advanced somewhat. Minimal linear atelectasis seen at the left lung base. Sternotomy sutures are present. Note is again made of a comminuted left distal clavicle fracture, previously seen on the torso CT of ___.
