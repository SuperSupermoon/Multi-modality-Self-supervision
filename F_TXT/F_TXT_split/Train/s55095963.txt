The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with normal heart size. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. The lungs are well expanded with relative paucity of pulmonary markings at the apices consistent with emphysema. Patchy opacity at the right lung base is slightly improved but not completely resolved in may indicate superimposed infection or aspiration. There is no pneumoperitoneum. Mildly displaced right posterior rib fracture is better assessed on recent CT. Comparison to the prior outside hospital CT shows a nodular opacity at the right lower lobe measuring 2.3 x 1.4 cm (series 5a, image ___). An ascending aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.5 cm is present. Coronary artery disease is severe.
