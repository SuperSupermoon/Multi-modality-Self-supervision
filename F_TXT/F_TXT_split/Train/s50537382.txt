AP chest compared to ___: Pulmonary edema has improved in the right lower lung, worsened in the left since ___. Right upper lobe is more densely consolidated than either and unchanged. Left lower lobe is airless and moderate left pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse are stable. Heart is large, substantially obscured by mediastinal fat and adjacent pleural abnormality. Left supraclavicular venous lines end in the upper SVC. Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement, but appears to cannulate a narrowed subglottic trachea. If feasible, upright radiographs are more reliably interpreted regarding the relative contributions of pleural effusion, at least layering pleural effusion, and pulmonary edema to a complicated radiograph of the chest.
