The possibility of small bilateral pneumothorax is impossible to exclude given the severity of stable but pronounced subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum, all of which is attributable to the escape of previous large right pleural air collection with placement of the right basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter.

Pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage are not excluded. Heart size normal.
