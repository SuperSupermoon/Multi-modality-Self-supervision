Feeding tube is noted extending below the diaphragm with the tip not clearly visualized within the field of view provided. Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of bronchovascular markings. Cardiac silhouette is accentuated by low lung volumes. There is stable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. There is right basal opacification consistent with atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacification appears consistent with atelectasis. Small amount of pleural effusion at the left lung base cannot be excluded. Left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis appears relatively similar to the most recent prior examination. Underlying infectious process cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.
