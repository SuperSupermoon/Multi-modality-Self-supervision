Port-A-Cath catheter tip terminates at the level of cavoatrial junction. The left chest tube is in place. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are more pronounced than on the prior study potentially due to decreased lung volumes. Vascular congestion is noted.Right basal opacity in the left basal opacity most likely reflect atelectasis but superimposed infection is a possibility, attention to this area on the subsequent studies is required.
