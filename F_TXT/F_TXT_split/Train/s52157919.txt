No comparison. Radiographically normal appearance of the cardiac silhouette. Mild widening of the right pulmonary artery. Mild elongation of the descending aorta. Normal lung volumes. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung basis. No pleural effusions. Radiographically, there is no convincing evidence for the presence of pulmonary nodules. However, CT should be performed to exclude pulmonary nodules if the clinical suspicion for the presence of such regions is high.
