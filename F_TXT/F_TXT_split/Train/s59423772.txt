In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter is been removed. Right subclavian catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC. There is further increase in bilateral pulmonary opacifications, much of which probably represents elevated pulmonary venous pressure. However, there is a more coalescent area of opacification in the right upper lobe. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent a area of pneumonia.
