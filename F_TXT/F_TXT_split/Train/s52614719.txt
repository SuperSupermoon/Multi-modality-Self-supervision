There has been interval removal of a right PICC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. The hilar contours are unchanged. Stable mild pulmonary edema. There is an unchanged, small left pleural effusion with interval improvement in left basilar atelectasis. A new focal opacity at the right base with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm may reflect interval increase in pleural fluid with adjacent atelectasis; however, superimposed pneumonia should be considered.
