A portable frontal sinus supine chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a nasogastric tube, with the tip and side port terminating within the stomach. A right jugular central line is unchanged in position, again terminating at the cavoatrial junction. Cardiomegaly is similar in appearance. There is again moderate to severe pulmonary edema, likely unchanged allowing for differences in positioning. Increased obscuration of the bilateral hemidiaphragms, right greater the left, likely related to layering effusions. There is no large pneumothorax.
