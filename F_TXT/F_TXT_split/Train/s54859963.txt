Enlarged cardiac silhouette is similar in size with pericardial drain in place. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Pleural effusions have increased in size, small on the right and small-to-moderate on the left. Persistent bilateral retrocardiac opacities probably due to atelectasis, but underlying infectious consolidation is not excluded.
