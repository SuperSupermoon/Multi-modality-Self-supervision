Compared the prior study, appearances are grossly unchanged. Linear atelectasis noted in the left mid lung. Streaky opacities in the right lung again noted. A diffuse hazy airspace opacity in the right lung is consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema. There is a small right pleural effusion. Persistent mild cardiomegaly. Calcification of the thoracic aorta. Left lower lobe atelectasis.
