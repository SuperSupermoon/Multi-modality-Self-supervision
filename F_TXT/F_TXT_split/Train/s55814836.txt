Cardiomegaly and vascular distention are accompanied by decrease pulmonary vascular congestion and improving pulmonary edema with mild residual interstitial edema remaining. Bibasilar patchy and linear opacities are present, slightly improved on the left and worse on the right, most likely due to atelectasis with adjacent small pleural effusions but no visible pneumothorax.
