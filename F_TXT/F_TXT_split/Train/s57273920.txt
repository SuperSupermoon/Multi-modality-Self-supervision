No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The right hemidiaphragm is not well seen, raising the possibility of small pleural fluid compressive atelectasis at the base. Mild atelectatic changes are seen on the left. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
