Hyperinflation indicates COPD, probably emphysema. Rightward mediastinal shift and infrahilar consolidation are best explained by right lower lobe collapse, unchanged since earlier in the day, accompanied by increasing small right pleural effusion. Lateral view would be very helpful in subsequent assessment's. Pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged but there is no pulmonary edema. Heart size top-normal.
