AP chest compared to ___: New opacification has recurred at both lung bases, previously cleared on the right after thoracentesis. Findings could be due to dependent edema, since the heart is severely enlarged, but the pulmonary vasculature is not particularly engorged. I would recommend careful followup for possible pneumonia. Right PIC line ends in the right atrium, approximately 8.5 cm below the level of the carina, would need to be withdrawn 4.5 cm to position it low in the SVC. Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 2:45 p.m.
