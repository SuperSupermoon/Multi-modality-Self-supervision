Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Previously seen right upper lobe partial atelectasis has essentially resolved and there has been re-expansion of the right upper lobe. Mild left basilar atelectasis is seen. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. Mediastinal contours demonstrate a mildly tortuous aorta.
