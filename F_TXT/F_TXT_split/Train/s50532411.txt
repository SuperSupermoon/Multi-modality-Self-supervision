AP chest compared to ___: Low lung volumes and supine positioning make it difficult to say whether mild interstitial edema has developed, but I doubt it. Leftward rotation probably accounts for increase in size and change in contour of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, but mild cardiomegaly is presumed. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements. Small left pleural effusion is probably present. No pneumothorax.
