An AP portable chest radiograph shows a new right-sided thoracic catheter at the right lung base and reexpansion of previously consolidated perihilar right upper lobe segements. A small right-sided pneumothorax remains. In addition, there is now a small left apical pneumothorax which was not seen on the study from less than two hours earlier. The endotracheal tube is almost 6 cm above the carina and nasogastric tube sidehole is now at the level of the g-e junction and should be advanced. Leftward mediastinal shift is now corrected.
