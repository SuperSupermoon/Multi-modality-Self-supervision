The patient's chin overlies the medial lung apices, obscuring the view. There are linear opacities at the lung bases, left greater than right, suggesting atelectasis. Underlying consolidation at the left lung base is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion is seen although a trace right pleural effusion be difficult to exclude. There is no overt pulmonary edema. The aorta is calcified with the upper mediastinum is not well assessed due to patient's overlying chin. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.
