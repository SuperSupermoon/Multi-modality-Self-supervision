The heart is normal in size. The aortic arch shows patchy calcification. There is a suspected small pleural effusion on the left and a possible layering pleural effusion on the right. Pulmonary architecture appears coarse and irregular. The interstitium is also moderately prominent in the mid-to-lower lungs. There is no pneumothorax. Prior healed rib fractures involve the right posterior third through fifth ribs. The right acromioclavicular joint is widened and the distal right clavicle has an expansile appearance. The latter findings are probably also post-traumatic.
