AP chest radiograph. ET tube terminates 2.2 cm above the diaphragm. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Mediastinal clips and mitral valve replacement are again noted. A transvenous pacer lead terminates in the right ventricle. There is probably a small left pleural effusion with retrocardiac atelectasis, though left lower lobe collapse cannot be excluded. Large right hilum is chronic, but there are subtle opacities at the right base not present on ___. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
