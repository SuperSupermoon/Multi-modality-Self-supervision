Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. An esophageal temperature probe terminates in the lower esophagus. Nasogastric tube is seen beyond the diaphragm, likely in the upper abdomen. There are at least moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, and mild interstitial edema. The heart and mediastinum are obscured. Lungs are largely obscured as well.
