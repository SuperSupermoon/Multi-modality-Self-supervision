As compared to the previous examination, the patient has received a tracheostomy tube. The nasogastric tube was removed. The right PICC line is in unchanged position. The lung volumes remain low. Small bilateral pleural effusions and areas of atelectasis are present at both lung bases. Taking into account a decrease in lung volume, the changes have not substantially increased as compared to the previous examination.
