In the interval since the prior study, the ET tube has been retracted now sitting approximately 3 cm above the carina. A right-sided subclavian line has been inserted which is in the mid SVC. No evidence of pneumothorax. The remainder of the exam including the right upper and left lower lobe opacities are unchanged.
