The lung volumes are decreased from the most recent prior study. There is increased opacification of the bilateral lung bases reflecting increased bilateral pleural effusions and underlying atelectasis. Increased opacities extending cranially for the left lung apex is compatible with fluid in the fissure. Increased opacities in the right lung apex most likely represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, which is worsening from ___. Pulmonary vascular congestion is again noted. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardio mediastinal silhouette is incompletely evaluated but likely unchanged with severe cardiomegaly and calcification of the aortic knob. A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle.
