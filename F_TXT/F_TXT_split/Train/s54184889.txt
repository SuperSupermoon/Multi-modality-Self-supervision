A single portable AP semi-erect view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above the carina. NG tube is within the stomach. Lung volumes are low. Band-like opacity at the left base likely represents atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, large effusion, or pneumothorax. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely accentuated by the portable technique, patient positioning, and low lung volumes. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
