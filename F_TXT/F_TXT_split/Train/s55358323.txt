Left lower lobe is collapsed, a long term. Small to moderate accompanying left pleural effusion is stable since at least ___. Uniform opacification at the base of the right hemithorax could be a posteriorly layering pleural effusion alone, but basal consolidation is not excluded. This region has not changed in appearance over several days. Mild cardiomegaly has improved since earlier in the day. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. New endotracheal tube ends at the thoracic inlet. Esophageal tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right jugular line ends in the mid to low SVC. No pneumothorax. Intracardiac calcification is probably in the mitral anulus.
