A portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. Lung volumes are slightly low, causing accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature. Aside from minimal bibasilar atelectasis, the lungs are clear. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly tortuous, as before. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are otherwise normal. There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. Multiple old right posterior rib fractures are again seen.
