AP chest compared to ___: Substantial improvement in the small right pleural effusion, reflecting drainage by the right lateral pigtail pleural drainage catheter. Mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary abnormality persists. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has been stable for several days following drainage on that side. Left PICC line ends in the axilla, as before. The heart shadow is probably moderately enlarged, but there is no longer mediastinal venous engorgement.
