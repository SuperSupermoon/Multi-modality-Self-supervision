In comparison with the study of ___, there is probably little overall change in the multifocal pneumonia involving the right base medially and the mid and lower portions of the left lung. However, the pulmonary vessels are somewhat less sharp than on the previous study. This could be a manifestation of elevated pulmonary venous pressure due to overhydration. However, part of this could also reflect the portable AP rather than upright PA technique.
