Since the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, there has been interval placement of an enteric tube which terminates in the body of the stomach. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.2 cm above the carina. Ill-defined opacity at the right lung base has significantly progressed, and concerning for aspiration. There may also be an opacity at the left lung base. Remainder of the lungs are otherwise clear. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a small pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There has been interval decompression of the stomach since the prior study.
