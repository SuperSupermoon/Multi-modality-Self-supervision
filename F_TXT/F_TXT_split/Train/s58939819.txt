Interval removal of the left chest tube, mediastinal drains and right internal jugular introducer. Stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy. Bilateral layering effusions with associated bibasilar airspace opacities most likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Right-sided dual lead pacer remains in place. Probable hiatal hernia.
