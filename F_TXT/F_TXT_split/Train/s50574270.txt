In comparison with the study of ___, the prominent opacification in the left mid to upper zone is no longer present, suggesting that it represented an artifact or area of collapse relieved by expectoration of a mucous plug. Mild hazy opacification at the left base could reflect some layering pleural fluid with underlying atelectatic changes. The right lung is essentially clear and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
