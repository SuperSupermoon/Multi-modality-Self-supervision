A pacemaker generator overlies the left chest wall. The leads appear intact throughout their course, terminating in the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle. The atrial lead continues to follow the path of a suspected duplicated SVC. There is stable increased density in the left lung base, findings suggestive of a moderate pleural effusion with underlying consolidation. Findings could reflect compressive atelectasis, though pneumonia is also within the differential. The left upper lobe and right lung appear clear. There is no pneumothorax. No vascular congestion or edema is evident. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited by the left basilar consolidation.
