Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis. A right-sided central venous catheter, Port-A-Cath is seen terminating at the cavoatrial junction. The patient is rotated to the left, likely explaining the mediastinum projecting to the left. Possible small right pleural effusion versus pleural thickening is again seen. Patchy opacity in the left retrocardiac region may be due to atelectasis; however, aspiration and/or infection is not excluded. Upright view would be helpful for further evaluation if/when patient able.
