AP chest compared to ___: Left hemithorax, small, has a normal post-operative appearance following left upper lobectomy, basal and apical pleural tubes in place and no appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Right lung base has mild atelectasis, but the remainder of the right lung is clear. Mediastinum has a normal post-operative contour, with some obliteration of the aortic knob by adjacent atelectasis or pleural effusion. Incidental note is made of a subglottic edema in the trachea, presumably a function of recent intubation. Atherosclerotic calcification in the left common carotid is heavy.
