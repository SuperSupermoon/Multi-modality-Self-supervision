Left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with a very small left pleural effusion and no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance with aortic stent remaining in place in the descending thoracic aorta. Heterogeneous opacities in the left mid and lower lung region have slightly worsened, and could potentially be due to a developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Moderate gastric distention is present within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen.
