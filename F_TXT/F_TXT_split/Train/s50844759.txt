Feeding tube with the wire stylet in place has been withdrawn to the low SVC and would need to be advanced at least 15 cm to move the tube into the stomach. Large bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe collapse have worsened. Cardiac silhouette is now obscured. ET tube, right internal jugular, and right PICC lines are in standard placements. No pneumothorax.
