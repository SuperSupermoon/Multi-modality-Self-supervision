Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Apparent widening of the mediastinal structures is likely due to low lung volumes. Old left-sided rib cage deformity is re- demonstrated as is an old right distal clavicular fracture and widening of the right acromioclavicular joint. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There may be chronic blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive of pleural thickening although a trace effusion is not excluded. Retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen.
