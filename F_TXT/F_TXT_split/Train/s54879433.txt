In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes. Monitoring and support devices are unchanged and in standard position. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with relatively mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The left hemidiaphragm again cannot be seen, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Although there is no definite consolidation identified on this study, in view of the substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and absence of a lateral view, the possibility of a retrocardiac consolidation can certainly not be excluded.
