Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. A large hiatal hernia is also present. Marked improvement in previously reported right lower lobe opacity favors atelectasis given the rapid improvement. Patchy opacity at left lung base persists and could reflect atelectasis, or potentially an aspiration pneumonia in the setting of a hiatal hernia. Consider followup chest x-rays with PA and lateral technique for more complete assessment of the lung bases when the patient's condition allows.
