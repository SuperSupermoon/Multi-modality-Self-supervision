A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends 6.5 cm above the carina. A left subclavian line ends in the SVC. A nasogastric tube follows the expected course although the tip is not visualized. Chest tube overlies the left hemithorax. Lung volumes are lower than on the prior study. Right middle lobe and right basilar atelectasis are similar to prior. Left basilar opacity is likely atelectasis but supervening infection cannot be excluded. Small bilateral pleural effusions and rib fracture are better appreciated on CT.
