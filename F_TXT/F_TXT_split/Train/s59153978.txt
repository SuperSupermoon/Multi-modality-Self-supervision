Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bilateral subsegmental atelectasis. Bibasilar airspace opacities, left greater than right, correspond to the chest CT findings of multiple masslike pulmonary nodules some with cavitation, potentially representing septic emboli, fungal infection, or multifocal pneumonia. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pneumothorax. Cardiac size is top-normal. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is better seen on prior CT.
