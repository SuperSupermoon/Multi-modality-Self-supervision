As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain low. The large hiatal hernia is seen in unchanged manner. Also unchanged is the extent and severity of the pre described pulmonary edema and the small pleural effusions. A minimal increase in radiodensity at the level of the right upper lobe likely represents local atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Old left humeral fracture.
