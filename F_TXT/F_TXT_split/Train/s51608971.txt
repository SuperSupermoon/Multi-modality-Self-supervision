Lung volumes remain low and there are is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. There are increasing bibasilar opacities with possibly small associated effusions. These findings may reflect atelectasis, bibasilar pneumonia or aspiration. Clinical correlation is advised. Given the low lung volumes, overall cardiac mediastinal contours are difficult to assess. A left subclavian PICC line is remains in place with its tip projecting over the proximal SVC.
