Compared to the prior study, opacities at the right and left base are slightly improved. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. No new focal infiltrate frank consolidation, gross effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Heart size remains borderline enlarged. Minimal thickening of the minor fissure again noted. Again seen is a right-sided PICC line with tip over distal SVC. Probable old healed fractures of the right mid clavicle fracture and lateral left sixth rib.
