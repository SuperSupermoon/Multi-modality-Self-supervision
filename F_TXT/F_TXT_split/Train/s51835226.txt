A single supine portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. There has been interval placement of a left subclavian central venous catheter, with its tip at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. The endotracheal tube remains appropriately positioned. The enteric catheter continues to terminate in the mid esophagus. The left pleural catheter ends at the left lung apex, unchanged. There is unchanged right upper lobe collapse. No definite left pneumothorax is seen, although evaluation is limited due to the supine technique. Posterior right upper and bilateral lower lobe opacities seen on recent CT from ___ are not well appreciated on the current study. Similarly, a small quantity of left hemoperitoneum is not seen on the present radiograph, likely pooling in the posterior sulcus. Bilateral rib fractures were better assessed on recent CT.
