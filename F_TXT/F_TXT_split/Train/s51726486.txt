Increased interstitial markings seen throughout the lungs, potentially due to lower lung volumes although superimposed pulmonary vascular congestion is suspected. More confluent basilar opacity suggests bilateral pleural effusions larger on the left and more dense consolidation at the lung bases are potentially atelectasis noting that infection or aspiration are also possible. Cardiac silhouette is grossly unchanged. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
