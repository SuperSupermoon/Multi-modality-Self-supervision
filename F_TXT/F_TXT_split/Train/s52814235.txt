Since previous exam there is increased interstitial marking compatible with moderate interstitial edema. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are unchanged with mild cardiomegaly. Bilateral pleural effusions are new and small. Left lower lung opacities are mostly compatible with atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. This patient was already investigated by a CT scan in ___ for multiple bilateral nodularity that are chronic and most prominent in the right upper lobe. Those changes are partly obscured today by pulmonary edema.
