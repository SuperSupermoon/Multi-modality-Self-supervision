Pulmonary vasculature is less dilated and there is less pulmonary edema than on prior exam. There is a right pleural effusion. There is plate atelectasis in the left mid zone. The right ventricle pacer wire passes in a supero-oblique direction within the heart instead the usual infero-oblique direction. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size cannot be assessed due to bilateral bibasilar opacities. There is a possibility that there an underlying pneumonia hidden by the pleural effusion and pulmonary edema. Recommend followup imaging as the edema clears.
