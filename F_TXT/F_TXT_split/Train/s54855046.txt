A frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of a left chest tube, now with a tiny apical pneumothorax which is new. The remainder of the exam is unchanged, including small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. There is no new focal consolidation. Left rib fractures are again noted. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
