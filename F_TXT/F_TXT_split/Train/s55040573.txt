There is a right-sided PICC which terminates in the upper to mid SVC. Right upper lobe and left perihilar opacities are again seen. There is persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely due to a small-to-moderate pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. The right pleural effusion appears stable to possibly minimally decreased as compared to the prior study. No left pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
