As compared ___ radiograph, widespread bilateral pulmonary opacities have worsened, particularly in the right lung. These findings are superimposed upon poorly defined pulmonary nodules. A moderate to large right pleural effusion has substantially increased in size, along with development of a small left pleural effusion. Known intrathoracic lymph node enlargement is more fully assessed by CT of 2 days earlier.
