The NG tube is seen within the stomach. A left subclavian central venous catheter ends in the upper SVC. There has been removal of the endotracheal tube. In comparison to the prior radiograph, there are lower lung volumes with new mild hazy bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears slightly larger, likely due to the lower lung volumes. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An IVC filter is seen within the abdomen.
