Since the recent radiograph, one of three chest tubes has been removed. Subtle crescenteric lucency adjacent to right hemidiaphragm could reflect a localized basilar pneumothorax. Moderate loculated right pleural effusion has increased in size, and diffuse right lung opacities have also slightly worsened, particularly at the right base. Multifocal patchy and linear opacities in the left mid and lower lung have also slightly worsened, and the constellation of lung findings is likely due to a combination of multifocal pneumonia and coexisting atelectasis as demonstrated on recent CT of three days earlier.
