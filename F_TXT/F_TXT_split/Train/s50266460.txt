The lungs are clear aside from minimal dependent atelectasis. There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal contours are normal. Note is made of a large hiatal hernia, as before. There is air under both hemidiaphragms, consistent with pneumoperitoneum, not unexpected in a post-operative patient. Additionally, a small quantity of air seen within the mediastinum, also not unexpected post-operatively.
