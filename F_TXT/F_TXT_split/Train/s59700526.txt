Lung apices are excluded from this study centered at diaphragm. Esophageal drainage tube has been repositioned, probably beyond the pylorus, not generally standard placement. Bilateral perihilar consolidation is improving, presumably resolving pneumonia. Moderate right pleural effusion is stable, but pulmonary vascular engorgement has improved. A left-sided central venous dialysis catheter ends in the mid to low SVC. Tip of the ET tube is in standard position.
