Mild cardiomegaly is present. Mediastinum and pulmonary vasculature are mildly congested, though I do not see evidence of frank pulmonary edema. Increased retrocardiac density and minimal right lower lung opacity suggests bi-basal atelectasis, left side more than right. Left pleural effusion is minimal.
