As compared to the previous radiograph, the pneumothorax on the left, best visible at the lung bases, has slightly decreased in extent but is still clearly visible. There is no evidence of tension. The position of the pigtail catheter on the left is constant. No new parenchymal opacity. At lower lung volumes, a small area of atelectasis is seen in unchanged manner.
