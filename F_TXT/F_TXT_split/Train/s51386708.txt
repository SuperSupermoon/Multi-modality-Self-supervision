In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better inspiration. The tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 6.7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube crosses the lower margin of the image but than apparently coils on itself so that the tip is in the fundus close to the esophagogastric junction. Cardio mediastinal silhouette is stable and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion. There is mild asymmetry of opacification at the left base, raising the possibility of a developing consolidation.
