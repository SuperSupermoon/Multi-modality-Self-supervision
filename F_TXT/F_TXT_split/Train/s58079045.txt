A single AP radiograph of the chest was obtained. As before, the patient is status post midline sternotomy and CABG. Lung volumes are slightly low. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no pulmonary edema is present. New heterogeneous opacities at the left lung base are some combination of atelectasis, and small effusion, though infection is not excluded. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax. Left sided rib deformities appear chronic. Left PICC has been removed.
