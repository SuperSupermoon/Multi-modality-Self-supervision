Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes with moderate bilateral pleural effusions. A left chest tube has been placed in the interim, with resultant decrease in size of left pleural effusion. Airspace opacity in the left lower lobe likely reflects reexpansion pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are notable for a known anterior mediastinal mass. There is no pneumothorax.
