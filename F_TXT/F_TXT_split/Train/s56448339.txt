As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new double-lumen catheter over the left internal jugular vein. The tip of the catheter distally projects over the right atrium. The other monitoring and support devices, in particular, the tracheostomy tube are in unchanged position. The pleural effusions seen on the previous image are less extensive than before, but the bilateral parenchymal opacities have increased. The distribution and pattern of these opacities favors pulmonary edema over pneumonia.
