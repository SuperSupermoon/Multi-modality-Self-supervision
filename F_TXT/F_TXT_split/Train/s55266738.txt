1. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm and the tip is projecting over the stomach. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stable. The previously described multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules are well visualized on the current study, likely due to differences in positioning, but further imaging evaluation with CT remains recommended. Results of this examination were entered into the critical results dashboard on ___ at 9:56 a.m. Lung volumes are slightly diminished with patchy opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large effusions.
