A single portable frontal view of the chest was performed. The cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged and, accounting for technique, is worse. There is a mild congestive heart failure, worse than prior. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no focal airspace consolidation. Calcifications are seen within the aortic arch. A right brachiocephalic venous stent is re- demonstrated.
