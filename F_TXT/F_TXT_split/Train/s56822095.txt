In comparison with the study ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure and hazy opacification at the bases consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and underlying compressive atelectasis. In view of extensive pulmonary changes, in the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
