Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Increased opacity silhouetting the right heart border is compatible with infection. Numerous additional smaller focal opacities are widely distributed and consistent with multifocal infection. Persistent blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles is consistent with moderate pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Top-normal heart size appears stable.
