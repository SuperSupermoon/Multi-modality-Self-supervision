Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the region of the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is identified. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Ill-defined hazy opacity within the left lung base appears progressed compared to the previous chest radiograph, which could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema given the rapid interval progression. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Subsegmental atelectasis is noted in the left mid lung field. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
