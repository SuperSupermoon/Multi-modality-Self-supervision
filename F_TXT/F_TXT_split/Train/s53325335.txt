As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased. Presence of larger pleural effusions can now be excluded. On the right and the left, however, small-to-moderate areas of atelectasis persist. Minimal fluid overload, moderate cardiomegaly. The monitoring and support devices, including the chest tubes and mediastinal drains are in unchanged position. No evidence of pneumothorax.
