The lungs appear clear without evidence of focal consolidation. There is no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. There is diffuse dilatation of multiple loops of small bowel, which is incompletely evaluated on this non dedicated exam. There is equivocal appearance for free intraperitoneal air in the left upper quadrant. Evaluation for intraperitoneal free air will be resolved with CT Abdomen, which will be obtained shortly later today.
