AP chest compared to ___: Widespread pulmonary opacification which increased dramatically between 7 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. has continued to worsen, even though heart size is smaller. Findings due to non-cardiogenic edema or rapidly progressive and severe pneumonia. Pleural effusions, at least small in size, have increased since earlier in the day. ET tube and an upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements. I don't see a central venous catheter. There is no pneumothorax.
