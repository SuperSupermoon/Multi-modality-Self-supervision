As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The lung volumes remain low, monitoring and support devices are in constant position. The bilateral pleural fluid collections are unchanged. The retrocardiac lung areas have slightly increased in transparency, likely reflecting improved ventilation. No new parenchymal opacities.
