In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube has been removed. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Mild indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with small pleural if fusion and atelectasis, though the change from the previous study could merely be a reflection of difference in patient position. Otherwise little change.
