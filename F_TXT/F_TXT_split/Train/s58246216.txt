An ET tube is present, tip approximately 8.9 cm above the carina on this lordotic film. Pacemaker type leads overlie the chest. There are low inspiratory volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but likely accentuated by technique and unchanged. Hazy density at the left lung base is consistent with a small to moderate left effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Minimal patchy opacity again noted in the right cardiophrenic region. There is vascular plethora, though this is likely also accentuated by technique and appears slightly improved compared with the earlier study. No right effusion identified.
