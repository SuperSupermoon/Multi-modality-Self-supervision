As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, potentially caused by increasing ventilatory pressures. As a consequence, the widespread bilateral parenchymal opacities have minimally decreased in extent and severity but are likely to be overall unchanged. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
