The lung volumes are very low. Moderate cardiomegaly is present. There are bilateral diffuse and subtle increases in radiodensity seen over the entire lung parenchyma. These changes might be the result of layering pleural effusions, low lung volumes, compounded by the body habitus of the patient. Both lateral and frontal views as well as a repeat radiograph with a stronger inspiratory effort would be helpful in determining the nature of the opacities.
