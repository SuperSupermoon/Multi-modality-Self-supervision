The patient's chin and mask overlie and obscure the upper portion of both lungs. Inspiratory volumes are lower than on the prior film and the patient appears more kyphotic. Allowing for this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Mild vascular plethora and bibasilar atelectasis is similar to the prior film. No frank consolidation or gross effusion. Incidental note made of bilateral severe glenohumeral osteoarthritis.
