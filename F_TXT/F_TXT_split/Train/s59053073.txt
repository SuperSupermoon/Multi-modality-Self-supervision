In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Tracheostomy tube remains in place. Opacification of the right upper zone persists, consistent with large loculated fluid collection. There is also pleural fluid along the right lateral chest wall and in a subpulmonic location, similar to the previous study. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is essentially unchanged. There is again evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
