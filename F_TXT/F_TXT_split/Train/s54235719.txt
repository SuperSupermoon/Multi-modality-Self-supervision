Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. This exam is suboptimal as the patient is rotated to the left. Suggest repeat with better patient positioning. Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 5.6 cm above the level of the carina. Perihilar opacities are seen, new since the prior study two hours prior, suggesting pulmonary edema rather than infection given short-term development. There is left mid to lower lung opacity and retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. The mediastinum may also be shifted to the left, although this is difficult to truly discern since the patient is rotated in that direction as well. The constellation of above findings may relate to partial left lung collapse.
