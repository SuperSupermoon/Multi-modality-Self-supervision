AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. A wide caliber double-lumen catheter has been inserted via the left jugular vein approach and terminates in the lower portion of the SVC, reaching the upper third of the right atrium. No pneumothorax has developed. Previously described marked cardiomegaly persists. Cardiac contours, however, are partially obscured by the high positioned diaphragms and bilateral pleural effusions which are more marked on the left than the right. No new parenchymal infiltrates are identified. In comparison with the portable examination of ___ a mild progression of the previously described CHF pattern and pleural effusions has occurred. Previous chest PA and lateral view examinations as well as a CT of the chest of ___ are reviewed. The patient has severe vascular calcifications including the aortic valve apparatus. As the congestive pattern has increased it is likely that the left-sided heart failure may be caused by aortic valve dysfunction and mitral valve incompetence resulting in secondary pulmonary hypertension and corresponding widening of the central pulmonary vessels.
