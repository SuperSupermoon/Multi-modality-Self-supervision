The newly placed Dobbhoff is seen below the diaphragm and curling in the stomach. There has been interval removal of a right internal jugular central venous line and the left subclavian line tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Interstitial opacities are increased consistent with worse pulmonary edema. The heart size, hilar and mediastinal contours are stable. A small left pleural effusion is new and no pneumothorax is seen.
