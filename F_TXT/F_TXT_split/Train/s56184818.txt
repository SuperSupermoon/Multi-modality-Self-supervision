The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The heart remains moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. There is mild pulmonary edema, worse when compared to the prior study. Small right pleural effusion demonstrates loculation laterally, and is relatively unchanged compared to the prior study. Rounded opacity projecting over the right lung base in the region of the minor fissure likely reflects a pseudotumor due to fluid tracking within the fissure. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Calcified nodule within the right lung apex likely reflects a granuloma. Calcified hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes as well as right basilar pleural plaque calcifications are again noted. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
