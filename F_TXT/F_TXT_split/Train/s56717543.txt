The carina is not well delineated. However, the tip of the ET tube probably lies approximately 2.7 cm above the carina. Note is made that it points toward the right-side of the tracheal wall. There are low inspiratory volumes, which likely contributes to accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Again seen are opacities at both lung bases, consistent with bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation. Small effusions cannot be excluded. There is upper zone redistribution, also likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Compared with ___ inspiratory volumes are lower, likely accounting for increased confluent confluence of the basilar opacities. Otherwise, no definite interval change. In left upper quadrant of the abdomen, a thin rim of lucency projects immediately outside what is thought to represent air within the stomach. Is there reason to suspect free air outside the stomach wall? Otherwise, this could represent artifact due to superimposition of portions of the stomach. No obvious pneumomediastinum. No pneumothorax detected.
