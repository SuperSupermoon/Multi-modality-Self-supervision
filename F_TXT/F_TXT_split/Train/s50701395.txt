Portable, semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There is increased opacification of the bilateral bases to the mid lung fields, which most likely represents pulmonary edema, however underlying infection cannot be excluded. There is severe cardiomegaly, which is stable. There are small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
