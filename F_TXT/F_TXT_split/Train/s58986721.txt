As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position. Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires, unchanged course of the left-sided PICC line and unchanged position of the right upper quadrant drain. Lung volumes remain very low, a substantial right and a moderate left pleural effusion are seen. The size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be enlarged and signs suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema are still present. Extensive atelectasis at both lung bases. Well ventilated areas of the lung show no evidence for newly appeared parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.
