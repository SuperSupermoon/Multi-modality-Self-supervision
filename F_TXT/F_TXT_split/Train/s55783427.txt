An azygos lobe is incidentally noted. There are low lung volumes. Mild basilar atelectasis without definite focal consolidation. There is central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac mediastinal silhouettes are likely exaggerated by a supine, AP technique. Thoracic spine fractures and sternal fracture better pain on subsequent CT.
