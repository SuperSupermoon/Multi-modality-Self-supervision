As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube was removed and replaced by a tracheostomy tube. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum but in the interval the patient appears to have developed a moderate left pleural effusion with subsequent left basilar atelectasis and the retrocardiac atelectasis that is slightly progressive. The left subclavian vein continues to be malpositioned in the azygos vein.
