IN COMPARISON WITH THE STUDY OF ___, THERE IS AGAIN SUBSTANTIAL ENLARGEMENT OF THE CARDIAC SILHOUETTE WITH MILD ELEVATION OF PULMONARY VENOUS PRESSURE. SLIGHTLY LOWER LUNG VOLUMES. BIBASILAR ATELECTATIC CHANGES ARE SEEN. RELATIVELY MORE INCREASE IN OPACIFICATION AT THE RIGHT BASE COULD WELL REPRESENT MERELY ATELECTASIS, THOUGH IN THE APPROPRIATE CLINICAL SETTING SUPERIMPOSED PNEUMONIA WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED.
