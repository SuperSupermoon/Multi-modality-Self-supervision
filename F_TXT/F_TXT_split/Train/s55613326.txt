Rotated positioning. In addition, there is apparent marked volume loss on the left, with leftward shift of the mediastinum and apparent leftward hyper inflation of the right lung. As result, the carina is not well delineated. The tip of the ET tube lies at the upper edge of the medial clavicular heads. An NG tube is present. The sideport overlies the lower mediastinum and likely lies proximal to the GE junction. The NG tube tip overlies the upper abdomen. A left subclavian PICC line is also displaced leftward with the mediastinal structures, possibly at the level of the distal SVC. In the left hemithorax, there is opacification along lung apex and in the left mid and lower zones, with obscuration left hemidiaphragm and left costophrenic angle as well as the cardiomediastinal silhouette. In the right hemithorax chest tube is present. No definite pneumothorax is identified. Aside from some crowded markings at the right lung base, no focal infiltrate is identified on the right. Possible small right effusion. Doubt CHF. Compared with ___ allowing for differences in positioning no definite interval change on the left. Minimal atelectasis a small right effusion are new.
