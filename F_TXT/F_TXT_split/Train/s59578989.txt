Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a right IJ central line with distal lead tip at the proximal right atrium. The endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There is again noted moderate pulmonary edema which is stable. There is a left retrocardiac opacity and likely small bilateral pleural effusions also unchanged. There are no pneumothoraces.
