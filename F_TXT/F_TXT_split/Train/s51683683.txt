New endotracheal tube is in standard position. New nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach but would need to be advanced at least 5 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. Lung volumes are lower, despite intubation and moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened. Greater consolidation has been consistently present at the base of the left long, either atelectasis or pneumonia. Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions may have increased since earlier in the day, although the volume is exaggerated by low lung volumes. Left subclavian infusion port ends in the right atrium, as before. No pneumothorax.
