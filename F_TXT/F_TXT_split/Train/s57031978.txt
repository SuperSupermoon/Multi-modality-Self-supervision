Right PICC and feeding tube remain in place, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema have improved compared to prior study. Additionally, a more confluent area of opacity in the right juxtahilar region has also slightly improved. The latter may be due to improving edema or infection. No new or worsening areas of lung opacification are identified to suggest a new source of infection.
