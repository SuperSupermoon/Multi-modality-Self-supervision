The patient remains intubated. An orogastric tube coils once in the stomach, as before. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Each hilum shows ill defined perihilar opacity and focal opacity in the right lower lung persists. There is now a small right-sided pneumothorax with a measured distance between the outer pleural line and chest wall measuring up to 7 mm; otherwise, aside from increased lung volumes, there is no other change. No definite fracture is appreciated.
