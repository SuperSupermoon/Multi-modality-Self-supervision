Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There are unchanged low lung volumes. Right lower lobe atelectasis has increased. Left lower lobe, retrocardiac opacity is stable. This could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. If any, there is a small left pleural effusion. There is no evident pneumothorax. Previously visualized tiny right pneumothorax on prior CT is not visualized in this examination.
