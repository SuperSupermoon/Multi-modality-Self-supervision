The view is lordotic. The heart is at the upper limits of normal size. The aorta is moderately tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unremarkable. There is a patchy opacity in the right costophrenic sulcus, probably atelectasis, although it is difficult to exclude a small pleural effusion. No definite pleural effusion is seen, however. There is no pneumothorax.
