There is hazy density overlying the right upper and mid lung fields, consistent with right upper lobe collapse, with better aeration at the right lung base. The right hemidiaphragm is newly elevated compared to the prior chest radiograph, indicative of increased volume loss. The left lung is essentially clear. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable. The upper abdomen is unremarkable.
