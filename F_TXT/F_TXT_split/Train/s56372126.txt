Single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable cardiomediastinal and hilar contours. Assymetric right apical thickening present. Otherwise, lungs are clear, though there is a relative hyperlucency of the bilateral upper lungs suggesting emphysema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax evident.
