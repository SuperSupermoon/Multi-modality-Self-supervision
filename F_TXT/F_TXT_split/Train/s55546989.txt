The patient is status post median sternotomy. Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged and unchanged in configuration. Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes are re- demonstrated compatible prior granulomatous disease. Calcification of the pericardium is also re- demonstrated. The mediastinum remains widened compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy and fluid. Moderate pulmonary edema appears worse. Moderate size bilateral pleural effusions appear slightly increased in size compared to the previous radiograph. Consolidative opacities in the lung bases appear worse in the interval. A right sided chest tube is again noted with tip projecting over the medial aspect of the right mid lung. No pneumothorax is identified. Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
