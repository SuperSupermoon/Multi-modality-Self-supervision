Multi focal pulmonary consolidation, presumably pneumonia has not improved. In the right upper lobe it appears to be cavitating, a finding that is usually not seen in eosinophilic or cryptogenic pneumonia. If there is pulmonary edema, it is mild. Moderate right pleural effusion and/or lower lobe collapse has worsened. Heart is normal size. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is present.
