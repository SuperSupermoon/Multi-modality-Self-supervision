A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a nasogastric tube which goes at least as far as the stomach, and an endotracheal tube with the tip almost 7 cm above the carina. The relatively high position is explained by the elevated chin, and need not be advanced. Bibasilar atelectasis is redemonstrated, increased in the left lower lobe. The remainder of the exam is unchanged.
