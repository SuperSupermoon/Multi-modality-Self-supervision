THE SEVERITY OF CONSOLIDATION IN THE LEFT MID AND UPPER LUNG ZONE, PRESUMABLY PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE TREATED CONTUSION, HAS DECREASED, BUT THE VOLUME OF AFFECTED LUNG IS UNCHANGED. LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION IS MINIMAL IF ANY. NO PNEUMOTHORAX OR RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION. HEART SIZE NORMAL. PNEUMOPERITONEUM IS SMALL, WAS PROBABLY PRESENT ON THE EARLIER STUDY ALONG THE RIGHT FLANK. THIS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO RECENT ABDOMINAL SURGERY.
