Tracheostomy tube tip is in unchanged position. Lung volumes remain low. Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Mediastinal contour is similar. Diffuse increased interstitial and ground-glass opacities are seen bilaterally, compatible with chronic interstitial lung disease with possible superimposed mild pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Percutaneous gastrojejunostomy catheter is noted with the distal aspect not completely imaged on this film.
