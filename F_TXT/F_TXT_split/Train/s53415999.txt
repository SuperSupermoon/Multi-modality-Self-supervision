Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present without frank interstitial or alveolar edema. Patchy and linear opacity in left retrocardiac region favors atelectasis, but aspiration and early focus of pneumonia could produce a similar radiographic appearance. Followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
