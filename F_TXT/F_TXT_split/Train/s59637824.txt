Comparison is made with prior study performed five hours earlier. NG tube tip now lies in the stomach. The sidehole is just distal to the GE junction. Otherwise, there has been mild interval improvement of the component of the pulmonary edema. Previously described diffuse opacities in the right lung with larger right lower lobe consolidation are otherwise unchanged. The nodular opacities are less conspicuous than before. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard position.
