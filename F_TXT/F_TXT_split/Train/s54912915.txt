No previous images. Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal in this patient with intact midline sternal wires. Mild engorgement and indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The left hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle are not well seen, suggesting some layering effusion with compressive atelectasis at the base. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia, though this would be difficult T definitely exclude in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
