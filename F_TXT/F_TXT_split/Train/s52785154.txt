Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, and a right apical pneumothorax has decreased in size with only a small residual pneumothorax remaining. Airspace consolidation in the right mid and lower lung region has slightly progressed, and is accompanied by a pleural effusion which is difficult to quantify in the setting of extensive adjacent lung consolidation. On the left, there is an apparent new area of consolidation in the mid lung region adjacent to a pre-existing area of left retrocardiac opacification and pleural effusion.
