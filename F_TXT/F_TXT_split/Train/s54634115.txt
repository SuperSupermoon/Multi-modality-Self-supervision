Indwelling right pigtail pleural drainage catheter has been withdrawn to the lateral aspect of the right hemi thorax and a second pigtail drainage catheter has been placed in the vicinity. Right pneumothorax is substantially smaller, but precise determination is difficult because of severe paraseptal emphysema. Mild pulmonary edema persists. Greater opacification at the left apex will need to be followed to exclude concurrent pneumonia. Heart size is normal. There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
