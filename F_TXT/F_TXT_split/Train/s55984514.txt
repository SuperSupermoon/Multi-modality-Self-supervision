As compared to the previous examination, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube was removed. The lung volumes are low. A new relatively extensive focal parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms is seen at the right lung base. The opacities ill-defined and could be account for not by a small pleural effusion. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No overt pulmonary edema.
