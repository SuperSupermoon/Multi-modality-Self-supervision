AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. Midline sternotomy wires are noted. A PICC line again noted entering the left arm with tip residing in the region of the superior vena cava. The previously noted left apical pneumothorax is not clearly visualized and may have resolved in the interval. There is marked cardiomegaly with mild interstitial edema. Retrocardiac opacity is noted which could in part reflect an underpenetrated technique, though the possibility of effusion and consolidation is difficult to exclude. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
