The lungs remain hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Subtle basilar opacities may be due to atelectasis without definite focal consolidation seen. Relative lucency of the upper lungs may relate to underlying pulmonary emphysema. No large pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Hilar contours are also stable. There may be minimal vascular congestion.
