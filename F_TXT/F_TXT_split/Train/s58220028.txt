Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Lungs are grossly clear except for a minimal area of increased opacity in left retrocardiac region, which most likely represents localized atelectasis. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. Increased lung volumes suggest underlying COPD.
