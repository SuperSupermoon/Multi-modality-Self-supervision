Assessment is limited due to positioning. Allowing for this limitation: The lungs are hyperinflated, compatible with emphysema. There is bilateral upper vascular redistribution and hilar engorgement suggesting fluid overload. Coarse interstitial thickening some patchy opacities in the right lung are conspicuous. There are bilateral small pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is present. Fractures of the left lateral sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs are identified.
