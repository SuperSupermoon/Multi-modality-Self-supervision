As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of rib fractures. The effusion on the left has substantially decreased. However, on the right, a new effusion has occurred. As a consequence, the areas of basal atelectasis have changed accordingly. On the current image, there is no evidence for the presence of pneumothorax. In the interval, a right internal jugular vein catheter has been newly introduced. No other relevant changes.
