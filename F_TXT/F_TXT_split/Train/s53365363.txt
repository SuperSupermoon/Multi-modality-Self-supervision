Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. A cardiac conduction device is contiguous with a single lead, which appears to terminate in the right ventricle, unchanged. Asymmetrical opacity at the junction of the left first anterior rib and medial clavicle is not fully localizer characterized on this portable radiograph. Lungs are otherwise remarkable for patchy bibasilar atelectasis. Bilateral pleural effusions are small.
