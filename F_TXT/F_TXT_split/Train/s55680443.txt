Low lung volumes are slightly lower, with greater visible atelectasis at the base the left lung. Lower lung volumes exaggerate moderate cardiomegaly and the caliber of the mediastinum due to at least dilated veins, supine positioning and fat deposition ; adenopathy may be present as well. There is no pulmonary edema or strong evidence of pneumonia. ET tube and nasogastric tubes are in standard placements respectively. No pneumothorax.
