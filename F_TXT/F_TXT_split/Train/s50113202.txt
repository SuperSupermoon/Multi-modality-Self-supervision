Since the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, there has been interval placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter. Right-sided pleural effusion has essentially resolved. Small left pleural effusion persists. There is a small right apical pneumothorax measuring approximately 15 mm from the chest cage. There is mild right basilar atelectasis. Heart is normal in size. Right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC. Multiple radiodensities projecting over the right upper quadrant are consistent with prior embolization of multiple portal venous branches. Lucency projecting superior to the pigtail catheter at may represent expected subcutaneous emphysema or air captured in between skin folds.
