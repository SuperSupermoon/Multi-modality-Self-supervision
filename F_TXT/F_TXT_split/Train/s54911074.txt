1. There is near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax. The airway does appear to be patent and therefore this likely represents lung collapse, although hemorrhage into the pleural space should also be considered. No pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Opacity overlying the right medial lung base may reflect middle lobe atelectasis as well. No right effusion is seen. Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is challenging as there is shift to the left consistent with the volume loss. This can be better assessed on followup imaging. 2. Endotracheal tube has its tip 6.5-7cm above the carina. This should be advanced 2-3 cm. The nasogastric tube has its side-port in the distal esophagus. This tube should be advanced 9-10 cm so that the tip and side-port are in the stomach. The esophageal probe has its tip at the level of the carina. The need for repositioning of the tubes was conveyed by phone to ___, the patient's nurse, by phone on ___ at 10:34am at the time of discovery.
