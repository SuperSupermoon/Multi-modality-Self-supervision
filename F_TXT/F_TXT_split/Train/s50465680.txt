The frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval change in position of NG tube which is now seen in standard position along the expected course of the esophagus with distal tip projecting towards the fundus of the stomach overlying the gastric air bubble. Otherwise, there is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. The remainder of the study is unchanged from the prior radiographs.
