There has been interval placement of rods overlying the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine in this patient status post recent L1 burst fracture from a fall. The patient is rotated to the right and the overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable despite differences in positioning. There has been interval appearance of a hazy opacity in the right upper lobe suggestive of partial upper lobe atelectasis. Aspiration or pneumonia would be less likely. No evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
