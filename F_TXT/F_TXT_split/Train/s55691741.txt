Comparison to ___, 04:49. No relevant change in position of the monitoring and support devices. The tip of the endotracheal tube is 4.5 cm above the carinal. The course of the feeding tube is unremarkable, the right internal jugular vein catheter projects over the cavoatrial junction with its tip. The lung volumes have slightly increased, reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressures. Moderate areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung base persist. Previous signs indicative of pulmonary edema have decreased in severity. No overt pulmonary edema is currently present. No pleural effusions.
