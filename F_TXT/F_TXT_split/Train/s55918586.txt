Median sternotomy wires, replaced aortic valve, and left pacemaker defibrillator device are unchanged. Lung volumes have slightly decreased in the interim. There is central pulmonary vascular congestion with moderate pulmonary edema. Indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm, descending aorta, and costophrenic angle most likely reflects a combination of the small left pleural effusion, atelectasis, and edema, worse since ___. Moderate cardiomegaly is overall unchanged. No right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. No definite focal consolidation, however concurrent infection, particularly in the left lower lobe, in the appropriate clinical situation cannot be excluded.
