CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW A left-sided chest tube is in place. There is a small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is also patchy opacity at the right base. The extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the film. Compared with one day earlier, cardiomediastinal silhouette and other findings are essentially unchanged. No pneumothorax is detected.
