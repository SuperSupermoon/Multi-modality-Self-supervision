New right IJ catheter has been placed with the tip ending in the right atrium. There is no pneumothorax. Lung fields are still moderately inflated with bibasilar linear atelectasis, more prominent at the left base. These findings are consistent with aspiration. The reticular opacification has increased for increased interstitial pulmonary edema. The pleural effusion is small and bilateral Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
