Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach, but side port is proximal to expected GE junction level, and tube could be advanced for optimal positioning. Left chest tube remains in place, with persistent left apicolateral pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Pulmonary opacities in mid and lower lungs have slightly improved in the interval, and a right pleural effusion has decreased in size. Moderate left pleural effusion is not appreciably changed.
