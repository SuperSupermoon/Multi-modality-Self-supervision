Study is somewhat limited by patient rotation. An endotracheal tube is in standard position, terminating approximately 4.2 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube tip is within the distal esophagus and needs further advancement. There is worsening volume loss in the right lung with increased opacification most likely reflective of worsening collapse. A moderate size right pleural effusion is re- demonstrated. Additionally there is rightward shift of mediastinal structures. The aorta is diffusely calcified. The left lung remains clear. No pneumothorax identified. Multiple clips are noted within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
