Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with tip not identified. Right internal jugular central line and right-sided pigtail pleural catheter remain in place. Interval removal of the left-sided pacemaker. The heart remains enlarged, although mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to patient rotation. There are likely layering effusions, left greater than right. Retrocardiac consolidation most likely reflects partial lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax.
