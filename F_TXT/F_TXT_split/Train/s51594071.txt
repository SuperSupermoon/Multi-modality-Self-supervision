Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is identified. Heart size is normal. Aorta is tortuous and calcified diffusely. The hila are prominent bilaterally, compatible with prominent pulmonary arteries as seen on the prior CT from ___. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted with cephalization of pulmonary vascular markings. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. Biliary drains are partially imaged in the right upper quadrant.
