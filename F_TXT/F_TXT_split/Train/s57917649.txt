A left mid-to-lower lung opacity and right basilar opacity persist, which may be due to multifocal infection. While opacity projecting over the left hemithorax may be very minimally decreased, overall, there is no significant interval change. The left aspect of the cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the left-sided opacity. Otherwise, grossly the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
