No pneumothorax or substantial left pleural effusion since ___ following removal of left pleural drain. Elevation of the base the right lung could be due to the a small subpulmonic right pleural effusion. Linear atelectasis in the left midlung unchanged. Heart is top-normal size, exaggerated by low lung volumes. A metallic, wire device, projecting over the left heart border, is unfamiliar to me. Clinical correlation recommended.
