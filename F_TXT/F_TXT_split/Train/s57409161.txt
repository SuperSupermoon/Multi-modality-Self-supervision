As compared to the previous radiograph, there has been a new insertion of a right central catheter. The catheter shows an abnormal course and crosses the midline over the heart. As no duplicated superior vena cava was documented on the recent CT, this position is worrisome for arterial cannulation. At the time of observation, the findings were immediately reported by telephone. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other complication. The other monitoring and support devices are constant. There is mild further worsening of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities.
