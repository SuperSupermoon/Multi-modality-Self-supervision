There is moderate to severe thoracic dextroscoliosis which complicates the interpretation of this study. In comparison most recent study, the right lung volume is lower and the left lung volume is slightly increased. The lower lung volume on the right could be due to worsening atelectasis and/or worsening pleural effusion. Slight improvement of left pleural effusion but worsening of lower lung atelectasis. The apices are difficult to assess due position of the patient's neck and chin overlying these regions. Severe cardiomegaly is stable.
