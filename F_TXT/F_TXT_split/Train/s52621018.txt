Portable semi-erect radiograph demonstrates improved bilateral aeration. There is continued vascular congestion that may be improved although this can be secondarily related to improved aeration. There is bilateral basilar atelectasis with a possible small left pleural effusion. No new focal consolidation. No pneumothorax. The right-sided PICC is seen at the level of the mid SVC.
