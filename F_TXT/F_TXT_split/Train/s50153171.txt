Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.2 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip and side-port are within the stomach. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Linear opacities in the left lung base likely reflect areas of atelectasis. The lung apices are excluded from the field of view and therefore assessment for a pneumothorax is limited. No pleural effusion is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
