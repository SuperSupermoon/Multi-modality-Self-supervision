Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. BA AICD appears unchanged in position with leads extending to the region of the right atrium and right ventricle. Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted. The lungs are clear bilaterally. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable with top-normal heart size. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Bony structures are intact.
