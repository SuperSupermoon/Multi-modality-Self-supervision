Endotracheal tube tip is in appropriate position 4.5 cm cranial to the carina. NG tube tip terminates at least within the mid gastric body, with tip outside of field-of-view. Lung volumes are low accentuating the cardiac silhouette and hilar contours, though there appears to be a degree of central pulmonary vascular congestion with increased density in the infrahilar left lower lobe though subsequent radiograph demonstrates no pneumonia. Heart size is normal. Prominence of the central pulmonary vascular structures is likely secondary to low lung volumes. Lungs are grossly clear. Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
