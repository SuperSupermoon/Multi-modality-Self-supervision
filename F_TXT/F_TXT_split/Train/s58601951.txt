Radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained to assess position of a nasogastric tube, which has been advanced in the interval, initially coiling in the proximal stomach, with distal tip in the expected location of the gastroduodenal junction. Within the imaged portion of the chest, a moderate-sized left pleural effusion is again demonstrated with an apparent subpulmonic component, and adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis and/or consolidation. Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved with a residual patchy right retrocardiac atelectasis remaining.
