Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6.8 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is mild pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness, worse since the previous examination. Patchy opacity is seen within the right lung base which may reflect aspiration or infection. The left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Rounded calcified structure within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen correlates to a right renal lesion as seen on the recent CT.
