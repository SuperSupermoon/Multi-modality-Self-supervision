No discrete pulmonary consolidation is visible on the limited evaluation afforded by this rotated, angulated, frontal bedside chest radiograph. Conventional PA and lateral views would be more revealing, if feasible. Heart is mildly enlarged and pulmonary vasculature is engorged. There is no appreciable pleural effusion.
