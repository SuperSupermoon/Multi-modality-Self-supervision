The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, allowing for small differences in technique. There are patchy new basilar opacities with hazy density in the right costophrenic sulcus and more streaky left basilar opacities. These are more typical of atelectasis than pneumonia. There is no evidence for congestive heart failure.
