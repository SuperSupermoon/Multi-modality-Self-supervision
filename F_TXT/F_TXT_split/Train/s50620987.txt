As compared to the prior radiograph performed yesterday morning, there is interval enlargement of an area of opacification in the right perihilar region, which most likely represents worsening pulmonary edema. However, an underlying infection cannot be excluded. A small right pleural effusion is noted. There is no pneumothorax. The heart remains enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aortic arch.
