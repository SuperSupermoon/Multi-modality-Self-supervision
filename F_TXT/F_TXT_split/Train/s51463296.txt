As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular vein catheter was removed and the nasogastric tube was replaced by a Dobbhoff catheter. The course of this catheter is unremarkable, the tip projects over the mid parts of the stomach. No evidence of complications is present, notably no pneumothorax detected. Platelike atelectasis are seen in unchanged manner, left more than right, at the level of the lung bases.
