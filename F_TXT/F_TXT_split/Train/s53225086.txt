Previous mild pulmonary edema has cleared, but severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Left heart obscures much of the left lower lobe, but there is probably some pleural effusion and atelectasis. The upper lungs are clear. Right PIC line can be traced as far as the low SVC. Transvenous right and left ventricular leads are unchanged in their respective positions. The ventricular assist cannula is grossly unchanged in position. There is no pneumothorax.
