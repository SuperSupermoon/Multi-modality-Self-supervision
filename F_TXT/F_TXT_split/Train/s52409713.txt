Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to a pleural effusion. Evidence of hiatal hernia is again seen. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable. Bilateral vagal nerve stimulators are again seen, without significant change in position.
