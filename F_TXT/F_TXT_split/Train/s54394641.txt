As compared to the previous radiograph, there is marked improvement with reduction of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities. The opacities are now confined to the lingula in the right lung base, overall to the more central areas of the lung. Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. Also removed is the aortic balloon pump. The remaining monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
