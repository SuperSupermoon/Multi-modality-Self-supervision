An endotracheal tube has been placed with the tip terminating approximately 2.8 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing to the mid-to-lower esophagus but not below the diaphragm. The overall appearance of the chest is unchanged from the study performed 30 minutes earlier with patchy opacification at the right lung, predominantly in the right lung base and the left lung base as well compatible with multifocal pneumonia. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged, and there is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. The patient is status post median sternotomy.
