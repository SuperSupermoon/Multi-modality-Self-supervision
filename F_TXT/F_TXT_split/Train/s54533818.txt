Endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the proximal stomach. The bilateral pleural effusions appear smaller, but this likely is related to differences in patient positioning. Stable bibasilar opacities favoring atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered in the correct clinical setting. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-erect technique. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
