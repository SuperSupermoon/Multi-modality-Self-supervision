As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, no pathological parenchymal process, in particular no pneumonia, pulmonary edema or other acute disease. No pleural effusions. Normal appearance of the hilar and mediastinal structures. A minimal increase in radiodensity at the level of the medial right lung base is likely caused by minimal thickening of the bronchial walls but has no parenchymal component.
