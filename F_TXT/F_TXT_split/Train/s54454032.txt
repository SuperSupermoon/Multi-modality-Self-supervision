Portable chest radiograph demonstrates Dobbhoff tube with the tip near the distal stomach, and a second radiodensity which projects over the Dobbhoff tube, which may represent the guidewire, is noted. Left chest wall pacemaker and leads and median sternotomy wires are stable. The heart is enlarged, but stable and the lung parenchyma is clear. Head positioning partially obscures the right lung apex. No pneumothorax.
