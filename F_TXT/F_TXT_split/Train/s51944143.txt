AP chest compared to ___: Right basal pleural tube is nearly in the same position today as yesterday. I cannot tell whether what was an upper chest tube has migrated inferiorly, now parallel or residing in right major fissure. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right, stable on the right, increased on the left. No pneumothorax. Generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality is longstanding. Bibasilar opacification is largely atelectasis. Heart normal size. No pneumothorax.
