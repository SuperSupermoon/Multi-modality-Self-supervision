Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 6 cm above the carina. Widespread subcutaneous emphysema is present bilaterally, and reduces the sensitivity of portable chest radiographs for detecting pneumothoraces. With this limitation in mind, no definite pneumothorax is visualized. A hyperlucency within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen may represent free intraperitoneal air in the setting of recent hiatal hernia repair, but is not fully characterized on this semi-upright study. Within the chest, cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Patchy bibasilar atelectasis is present. In addition to the above described diffuse subcutaneous emphysema, there is apparent pneumomediastinum in the upper mediastinal region.
