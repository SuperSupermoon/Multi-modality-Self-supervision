Portable AP semi upright chest radiograph was obtained. The lung volumes are low without pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Perihilar linear opacities are consistent with prior radiation therapy. Linear left midlung opacity could reflect progression of this radiation-induced change or reflect subsegmental atelectasis without pneumothorax or free air projecting on the diaphragm, but this is not a fully upright view. No displaced rib fractures are identified. Dual lead pacemaker is noted. Right-sided Port-A-Cath as before. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Rounded nodular opacity in the lower right chest is more apparent than the prior and could reflect metastasis. Additional nodular opacity seen betweeen the anterior first and second ribs on the right.
