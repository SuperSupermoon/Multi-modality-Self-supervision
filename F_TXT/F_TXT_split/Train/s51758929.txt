There is a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax. A right chest tube remains in place. A portion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is also seen coursing over the right hemithorax. Lung volumes are slightly low with persistent patchy opacities in the right lung and to a lesser extent at the left base suggestive of areas of patchy atelectasis. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pulmonary edema.
