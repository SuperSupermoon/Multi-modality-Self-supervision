A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Increased perihilar opacity with pulmonary vascular engorgement in the setting of cardiac enlargement is likely due to mild congestive heart failure. There is no substantial pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Increased opacity at the left lung base may represent asymmetric edema, but supervening infection cannot be excluded. Degenerative change at the acromioclavicular joint on the left is noted with joint space narrowing.
