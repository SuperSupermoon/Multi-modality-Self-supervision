A frontal AP view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Heart size is normal allowing for low lung volumes and technique. Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are within normal limits. No displaced rib fracture is identified. There is no free air under the diaphragm.
