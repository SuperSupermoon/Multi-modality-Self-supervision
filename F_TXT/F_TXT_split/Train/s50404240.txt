Lungs remain hyperinflated suggestive of underlying emphysema. The left basilar pigtail pleural catheter remains in place. Overall, loculated left apical, medial and basilar pneumothorax has decreased in overall size. The previously seen linear lucency at the right base is no longer apparent although there may be a very tiny right apical pneumothorax. There is improved aeration at the left base with residual patchy atelectasis. Right lung is grossly clear. Stable linear lucency adjacent to the descending aorta is suggestive of pneumomediastinum. Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular central line and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. A biliary stent is incompletely visualized.
