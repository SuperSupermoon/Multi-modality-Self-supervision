The right internal jugular Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position. There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube which has its tip near the gastroesophageal junction. Advancement by 8-10 cm would be recommended to place the tube within the stomach. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Patchy opacities at both bases more likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of lower volumes although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
