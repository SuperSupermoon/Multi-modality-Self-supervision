As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing pulmonary edema has decreased in extent and severity. There is no evidence of pneumonia but the relatively extensive left retrocardiac atelectasis. No larger pleural effusions. A rounded density at the left lung bases new and likely caused by overlaying soft tissues.
