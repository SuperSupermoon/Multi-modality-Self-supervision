Endotracheal tube ends approximately 8.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube courses through the stomach and out of view. There is mild cardiomegaly. The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique. The lung volumes are low, with dense opacity in the retrocardiac left lower lobe, likely atelectasis. There are diffuse interstial and opacities in both lungs with small areas of confluence bilaterally, likely reflecting pulmonary edema.
