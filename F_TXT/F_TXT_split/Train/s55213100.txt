The lung volumes are normal. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. An aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta cannot be detected. There is no pleural effusion, no left mediastinal widening and no apical cap that could suggest an acute aortic injury. However, given the lack of previous comparisons, short-term radiographic followup should be performed and the images should be re-evaluated accordingly. Status post sternotomy. Mild increase in diameter of the hilar pulmonary vessels. No substantial atelectasis. No lung nodules or masses.
