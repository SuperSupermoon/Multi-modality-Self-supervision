As compared to the previous radiograph, the right basal parenchymal opacity, potentially combined to a small effusion, has substantially improved. The right lung bases is now better ventilated. However, the mixed vascular and interstitial diffuse opacity in both the left and the right lung persist, likely indicating a combination of multifocal pneumonia and interstitial pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.
