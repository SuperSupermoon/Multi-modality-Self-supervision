Assessment is somewhat limited by patient rotation. An endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.6 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube tip is seen coursing inferiorly below the diaphragm though the tip is not well seen. Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Left-sided AICD/ pacemaker device is noted with single lead terminating in the region of the right ventricle. Heart is moderately enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The aorta remains tortuous. There is mild pulmonary edema, which has progressed since ___:03 today. More focal ill-defined opacities within the upper lobes bilaterally, greater on the left, may reflect areas of aspiration or infection. No pneumothorax is identified, and no pleural effusion is seen.
