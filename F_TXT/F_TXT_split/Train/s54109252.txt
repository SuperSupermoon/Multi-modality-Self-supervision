AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Left hemidiaphragm is elevated, perhaps due to gaseous distension of the stomach. Then greater opacification in the left lower lobe can be explained as atelectasis. Milder atelectasis is present at the right base. A 2.5 cm long oval opacity oriented obliquely, lateral to the mid portion of the right hilus could be an unusual atelectasis, impacted small bronchus, or even pleural fluid in the interlobar fissure. Fever persists. I would repeat a chest radiograph, in no more than 12 hours, if the patient has had an opportunity for respiratory physical therapy. Heart size is normal. Pleural effusion is minimal if any. No pneumothorax.
