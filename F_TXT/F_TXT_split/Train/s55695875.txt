There are low lung volumes. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle and opacity along the right minor fissure suggests a small right pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacities may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis although underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude. There is likely component of pulmonary vascular congestion. Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely exaggerated by low lung volumes and AP technique.
