Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. A vasovagal nerve stimulator is noted projecting over the left upper hemithorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are likely accentuated by AP position and supine technique. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion. The right costophrenic angle is not entirely imaged. Slight prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature, most likely relates to low lung volumes, supine position and AP technique, although mild vascular congestion is not excluded.
