Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Three catheters project over the left hemithorax, unchanged. Subcutaneous air has decreased, though is incompletely imaged. Left basilar atelectasis and probably a small left pleural effusion are unchanged. Right lung is clear. No new opacity is seen.
