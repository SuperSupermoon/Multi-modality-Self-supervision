The left PICC line has its tip in the proximal SVC. There continues to be bilateral interstitial prominence and patchy opacity at the left base. When compared to prior studies dating back to ___, the interstitial abnormality appears somewhat more prominent which likely reflects a component of superimposed interstitial edema. The expansile lytic lesion of the left lateral fourth anterior rib is again seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stable with the heart being enlarged. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Spinal hardware is incompletely visualized overlying the lower thoracic spine.
