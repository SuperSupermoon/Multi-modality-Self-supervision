The tracheostomy tube is in situ. Lower cervical spinal fusion hardware and postsurgical ___ are again noted. The heart is top-normal in size. Mediastinal silhouette is unchanged however there is mediastinal shift towards the left consistent with left lower lobe collapse as demonstrated by the persistent retrocardiac opacity, obscuration of left hemidiaphragm, and compensatory hyperinflation of the left upper lobe. There is mild subsegmental atelectasis at the right lung base, improved compared to prior study. No pneumothorax.
