Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax consistent with known large left pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. There is a small aerated portion of the lung in the upper left hemi thorax. There is a new moderate right-sided pleural effusion. Linear annular abnormality over the right central lung field likely represents artifact external to the patient. There is no pneumothorax. Note is made of a chronic right anterior shoulder dislocation, which is stable over multiple recent radiographs.
