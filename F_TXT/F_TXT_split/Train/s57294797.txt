A large left pleural effusion is layering on this semi-upright radiograph. Shift of cardiomediastinal structures is likely due to a combination of mass effect from the effusion and patient rotation. Left lower lobe opacity may reflect atelectasis and/or contusion in the setting of multiple left rib fractures. New small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has developed with adjacent basilar atelectasis and/or consolidation. Otherwise, no relevant changes since the recent study.
