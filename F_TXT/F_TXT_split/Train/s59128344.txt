Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position as well as a pericardial drain. Cardiac silhouette has slightly decreased in size with associated reduction in extent of pulmonary edema with mild residual interstitial edema remaining. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are present, and appears slightly larger than on the prior exam, but positional differences may contribute to this apparent change.
