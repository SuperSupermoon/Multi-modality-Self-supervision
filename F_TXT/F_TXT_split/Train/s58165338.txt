As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube was removed. The left subclavian line remains in situ. As expected, the lung volumes have decreased, causing areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung base. No pleural effusions. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.
