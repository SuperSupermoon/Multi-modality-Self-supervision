AP chest radiograph provided. Lung volumes are quite low. Heart appears mildly enlarged. There is increased pulmonary opacity noted bilaterally, which in part could be exaggerated due to low lung volumes and bronchovascular crowding, though mild edema is difficult to exclude. Curvilinear calcification projecting over the heart likely reflects mitral annular calcification. The mediastinal contour is poorly assessed. Clips in the right upper quadrant noted.
