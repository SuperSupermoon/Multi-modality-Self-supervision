Single portable frontal image of the chest. The ET tube terminates 7.2 cm above the carina. The lungs are well expanded. There is opacity at the right lung base and a possible opacity in the left lung base, which may represent atelectasis, but cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
