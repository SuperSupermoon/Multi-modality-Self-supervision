Lung volumes are low. Heart size is accentuated, but appears mild to moderately enlarged. The aorta is unfolded. The mediastinal contours otherwise unremarkable. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present due to low lung volumes, but no overt pulmonary edema is present. Bibasilar airspace opacities are more pronounced in the retrocardiac region, and could reflect areas of atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. Previously noted small bilateral pleural effusions appear nearly resolved, and no pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
