AP chest compared to ___: Opacification at the base of the right lung is more discretely marginated than I would expect from the effects of an overlying pleural effusion, and therefore I am suspicious of new or newly-apparent pneumonia. Left lower lobe has been airless since at least ___, presumably atelectasis, which is another potential source of fever. There is no pulmonary edema. The large heart has decreased in size and previous mediastinal vascular engorgement has cleared. ET tube and a Swan-Ganz catheter are in standard placements, and an upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
