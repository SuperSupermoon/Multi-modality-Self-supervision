Since the prior exam, there is a new chest tube entering the left chest wall with associated subcutaneous air. The tip is at the left base. New surgical chain sutures are noted in the right mid and lower lung zones. There is a tiny right apical pneumothorax. Widespread interstitial abnormalities are unchanged. There is new mild asymmetric left-sided pulmonary edema, likely a consequence of the surgical technique and positioning. There is no pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
