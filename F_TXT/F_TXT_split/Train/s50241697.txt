The right-sided PICC line and left-sided rib fractures are unchanged. A lucency is seen at the left apex, but a chest CT done three hours later failed to show a pneumothorax and therefore this artifactual. There is bilateral lower lobe opacities, compatible with volume loss/infiltrate. The one on the right is slightly improved and the one on the left is slightly worse.
