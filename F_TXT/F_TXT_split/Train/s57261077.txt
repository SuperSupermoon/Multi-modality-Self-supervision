In comparison with study of ___, there again are low lung volumes. There are two right chest tubes in place with any residual pneumothorax being very small. Engorgement of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, though this could merely reflect bronchovascular crowding related to low lung volumes. Atelectatic changes are seen at the bases, especially on the right, and multiple nodular opacifications are also still visible.
