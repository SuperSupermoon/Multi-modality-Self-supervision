Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___. 3 transvenous leads originate from the new left pectoral generator. As far as one can tell from a frontal view alone, the tip of one lead ends in the right atrium after the lead passes close to the tricuspid valve. The second lead is angulated as it passes the tricuspid valve heading to the floor of the right ventricle and there is a left ventricular lead ending close to the apex of the heart. There is no pneumothorax mediastinal widening or pleural effusion. New heterogeneous peribronchial opacification is present in the supra hilar and axillary regions of the right lung which could be asymmetric edema, but raise concern for pneumonia. Minimal interstitial abnormality is present in the perihilar left lung, probably residual edema.
