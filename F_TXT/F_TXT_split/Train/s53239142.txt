1. Single-lead right-sided pacemaker is unchanged in position. Right internal jugular introducer catheter and feeding tube are also likely unchanged, although the tip of the feeding tube cannot be definitively identified. No definite chest tube is seen. However, the right apical pneumothorax does not appear to be changed. Persistent bibasilar patchy opacities with more focal consolidation in the retrocardiac area and associated pleural effusions are also stable and likely reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall, stable post-operative cardiac and mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy.
