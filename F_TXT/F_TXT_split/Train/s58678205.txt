Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis. Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion has increased compared with the immediate prior study. There is no frank pulmonary edema. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Of note, the right costophrenic angle is excluded the field of view. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.
