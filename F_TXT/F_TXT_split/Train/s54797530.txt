Two right-sided chest tubes are present, similar in configuration to the prior film. The appearance of the right lung is similar, allowing for technical differences. Again seen is a large right effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. No pneumothorax is detected. The patient is status post sternotomy, with marked enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. As before, the right-sided heart border is obscured by the opacities at the right lung base, but no significant interval change is detected in cardiomediastinal size or morphology. The degree of retrocardiac opacity has improved. The left lung is otherwise grossly clear. There is minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle, unchanged. On the left, they areas upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. Vascular plethora in the right upper zone is likely secondary to compression of the right lung by the effusion.
