Single frontal portable view of the chest demonstrates a right PICC, which terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, overt pulmonary edema, or focal consolidation. The right costophrenic sulcus is excluded on this image. The lungs are well expanded and clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
