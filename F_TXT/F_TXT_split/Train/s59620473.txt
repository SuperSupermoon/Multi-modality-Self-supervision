As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are constant. There is no convincing evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax. A skinfold is projecting over the left hemithorax, creating a lucent line that parallels the chest wall. The extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities are unchanged in severity and distribution. Moderate cardiomegaly. No new parenchymal opacities. No pleural effusions.
