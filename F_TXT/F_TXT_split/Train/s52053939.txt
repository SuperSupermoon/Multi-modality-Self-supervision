A right-sided cardiac pacemaker projecting leads into the right atrium and ventricle, right IJ catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction, and the kyphoplasty cement are unchanged in configuration and positioning since the ___ examination. Mild cardiomegaly with central pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema is stable. A left retrocardiac opacity, likely reflecting atelectasis, is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable. There is no pneumothorax.
