Although there has clearly been increase in subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall since ___, I see no definite right pneumothorax, with an apical pleural tube in place. A small apical pneumothorax could be obscured by the subcutaneous emphysema. Greater opacification at the base of the right lung is also partially obscured, looks like vascular engorgement, rather than atelectasis or pneumonia, but should be followed carefully. Increased caliber to the azygos vein also suggests volume overload. There is no edema in the left lung.
