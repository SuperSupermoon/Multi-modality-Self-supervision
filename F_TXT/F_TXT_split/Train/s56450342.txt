The ET tube terminates approximately 6.8 cm above the carina. A Swan-Ganz catheter is positioned with the tip in the right main pulmonary artery, overall unchanged in position compared to the prior exam. Enteric tube traverses below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film. Layering right-sided effusion has improved compared to the prior exam. Linear radiopaque structure seen projecting over the proximal descending thoracic aorta is in the expected location and demarcates the intra-aortic balloon pump marker. Mild bibasilar atelectasis is persistent.
