Small left apical pneumothorax is demonstrated as well as a medial component of the pneumothorax adjacent to the and left heart border. Overall size of pneumothorax is probably moderate given the supine positioning of the patient, but is difficult to quantify due to exclusion of left costophrenic sulcus from the study. Left chest tube remains in place. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable, with persistent cardiac enlargement and pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by worsening edema. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions, not fully quantify due to exclusion of extreme lung bases from the radiograph.
