In comparison with the earlier study of this date, following transbronchial biopsy there is node evidence of substantial pneumothorax. The right upper zone is somewhat obscured by overlying structures. There is little overall change in the area of opacification in the right mid zone seen on the interventional procedure. Left lung is clear.
