A Dobbhoff tube is present. The radiopaque portion of the Dobbhoff tube extends beneath the diaphragm and likely overlies the fundus/proximal stomach. The previously seen NG tube has been removed. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is mild upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. Minimal atelectasis at the left base. No focal consolidation or effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly and an unfolded aorta is unchanged.
