Comparison is made with prior study, CT torso ___ and chest x-ray ___. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. ET tube tip is 7.3 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in the stomach. ET tube can be advanced a couple of centimeters for a more standard position. Large left supraclavicular catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Large opacity in the left lower lobe is consistent with known left lower lobe collapse and a small effusion, better seen in prior CT. There are multifocal atelectasis in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe. There is no pneumothorax.
