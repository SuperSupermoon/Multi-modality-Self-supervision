The lungs are well expanded with diffuse vascular engorgement and interstitial thickening with ___ B-lines consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema.

Cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are unremarkable aside from fullness mediastinal venous structures. Old right rib fracture is again seen.
