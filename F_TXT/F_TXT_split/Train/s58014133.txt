With the chin down, the tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 4.5 cm above the carina. It should be advanced 3 cm for more secure positioning. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the distended stomach and out of view. Mild pulmonary edema persists. There is greater consolidation at the right lung base which could be a combination of dependent edema and atelectasis or concurrent pneumonia. Careful clinical and radiographic followup advised. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal venous engorgement are unchanged. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial. No pneumothorax.
