Radiograph obtained for orogastric tube placement demonstrates an orogastric tube extending at least to the level of the diaphragm. Upper abdomen was not included on the radiograph and distal tip cannot be visualized for this reason. As compared to recent study from earlier the same date, exam is remarkable for overall worsening of multifocal bilateral pulmonary opacities with no other relevant changes.
