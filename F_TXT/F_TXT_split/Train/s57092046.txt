As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. Also removed is the Swan-Ganz catheter. As expected, the lung volumes have slightly decreased, causing minimally increased atelectasis at the left and right lung bases. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. There is no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax and no larger pleural effusions.
