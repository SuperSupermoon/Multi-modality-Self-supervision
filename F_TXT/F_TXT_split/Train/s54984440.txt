There are increased opacities in the perihilar distribution bilaterally but particularly on the right side. In this area, there is also evidence of peribronchial cuffing, but whether this is within the bronchus or around the bronchus is uncertain. This constellation of findings could be seen in cardiac failure and pulmonary edema process leading towards infection such as viral pneumonia is not ruled out. There is minimal left lower lobe atelectasis. There are no pleural effusions. The cardiac size is normal.
