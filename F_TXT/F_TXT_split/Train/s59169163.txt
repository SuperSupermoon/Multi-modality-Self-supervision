As compared to previous radiograph from 1 day earlier, support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Moderate right and small to moderate left pleural effusions are present, with apparent interval decrease in size on the right, although positional differences may contribute to this apparent change. Dense left retrocardiac opacification is unchanged.
