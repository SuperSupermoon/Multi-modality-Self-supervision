Three left chest tubes remain in same position as yesterday. There is also a left PICC line with tip terminating in the region of the cavoatrial junction. There is a moderate right pleural effusion as well as persistent right mid lung opacity likely representing pleural fluid in the fissure. There is also a small left pleural effusion. The left lung is otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax.
