As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the right PICC line is unchanged. The line projects over the mid to lower SVC. The cavitary lesion in the left upper lung has minimally decreased in extent. However, there is a newly appeared mild to moderate right pleural effusion with subsequent right basilar atelectasis. Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus suggests the presence of a minimal left pleural effusion. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
