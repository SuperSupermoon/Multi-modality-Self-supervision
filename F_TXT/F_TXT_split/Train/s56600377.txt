As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and all monitoring and support devices have been removed. The previously placed Swan-Ganz catheter has been exchanged against a right internal jugular vein catheter. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The tip of the catheter projects over the mid-to-low SVC. Minimal atelectasis at the lung bases. Unchanged normal appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
