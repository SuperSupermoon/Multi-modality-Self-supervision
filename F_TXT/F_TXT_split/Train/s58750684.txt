Right-sided dialysis catheter terminates in the cavoatrial junction. Left pectoral transvenous pacer leads terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle. Enteric tube extends beyond the diaphragm with tip out of view. Median sternotomy wires are intact. The heart is severely enlarged, unchanged since ___. Increased indistinct opacities bilaterally in combination with increased fullness of bilateral hila are compatible with increased mild pulmonary edema. The focal opacity in the right upper lung seen on prior chest radiograph appears less confluent on the current study. Increased opacity in the left lung base likely secondary to increased pleural effusion. Atelectasis at the right lung base has decreased. Small right pleural effusion persists. There is no pneumothorax.
