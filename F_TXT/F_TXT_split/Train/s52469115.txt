In comparison with the study of ___, there is a right chest tube in place with continued evidence of postoperative changes in the right hemithorax. Blunting of the costophrenic angle is again noted in. There is a lucent area in the right apical region, consistent with the recent resection. Chain sutures are seen in the region. The left hemidiaphragm is not optimally seen, consistent with mild atelectatic changes and possible pleural effusion at the left base. Otherwise, the left lung is clear.
