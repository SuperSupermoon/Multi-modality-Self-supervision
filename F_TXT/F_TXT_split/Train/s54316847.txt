Compared to the study from the prior day, there is improved aeration in both lower lungs. However, there continues to be obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm likely due to focal area of volume loss/effusion. There continues to be pulmonary vascular re-distribution. Tracheostomy and right subclavian line are unchanged.
