The patient is status post sternotomy and probably coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. The lung volumes are low with very mild relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, as before. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs appear clear.
