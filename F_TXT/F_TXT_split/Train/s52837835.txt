AP chest compared to 8:08 p.m.: A right apical pleura is now clearly demonstrated at a lower level than before, across from the sixth posterior rib, an increase since all of the prior post-tube placement images. Pleural pigtail catheter at the base of the right hemithorax unchanged in position. There is no appreciable right pleural effusion, though there could also be a basal component of pneumothorax. Left lung volume is quite low, but there is no mediastinal shift to suggest tension physiology. The heart remains borderline enlarged. There is no edema or focal consolidation. Transvenous right atrioventricular pacer leads are in standard placements.
