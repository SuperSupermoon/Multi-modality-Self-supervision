Endotracheal tube is visualized in the lower trachea. Minor atelectatic changes are noted at bilateral bases, greater on the left, and lung volumes are low. However, the lungs are otherwise without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. No acute fractures identified. The aorta appears tortuous and mildly prominent in caliber.
