There is a single-lead pacemaker whose lead terminates in the right ventricle, as before. The heart is slightly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, allowing for differences in technique. Slight blurring of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour may be due to a parenchymal opacity, probably minor atelectasis and it is difficult to exclude a very small pleural effusion.
