An endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina. A moderate right pleural effusion appears increased since the prior study from 8:03, possibly from a more supine orientation. However, a small left pleural effusion appears new. Mild interstitial edema appears overall slightly improved. The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stable. No pneumothorax is detected.
