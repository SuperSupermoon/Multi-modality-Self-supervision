The patient is rotated somewhat to the left. Given this, no focal consolidation is seen. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle and there could be a trace pleural effusion. No pulmonary edema is seen. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are similar to the prior study. Slight prominence and indistinctness of the hila suggest pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
