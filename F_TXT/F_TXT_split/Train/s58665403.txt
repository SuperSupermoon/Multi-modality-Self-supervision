The tip of the right dialysis catheter extends into the right atrium. A feeding tube extends into the stomach. A left central venous catheter tip projects over the cavoatrial junction. There is a markedly enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, increased since prior. Hazy bibasilar opacities, greater on the right, may reflect layering pleural fluid with subjacent atelectasis and/or pneumonia. No pneumothorax identified. Hyperdense material projects over the left upper quadrant.
