Since the prior study, there has been development of large opacity projecting over most of the left hemi thorax with mediastinal shift to the left. The left diaphragm is obscured. The right lung is clear. No right pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are not well assessed due to the left hemithorax opacification.
