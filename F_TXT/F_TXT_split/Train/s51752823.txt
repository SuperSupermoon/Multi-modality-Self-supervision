Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates complete opacification of the left hemi thorax, consistent with massive left-sided pleural effusion and left lung collapse. There is a large right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis as well. No pneumothorax. Assessment of the cardiac silhouette is not possible secondary to pleural effusion. Moderate-sized hiatal hernia is present.
