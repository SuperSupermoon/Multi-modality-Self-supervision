Indwelling left IJ line has advanced, and the tip now abuts the right wall of the SVC. It should probably be withdrawn 15 mm to ovoid vascular trauma. Tracheostomy tube midline. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out view. No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening aside from slight increase in caliber mediastinal vasculature. Heart size top-normal unchanged. Previous left lower lobe collapse has improved with new aeration at the base of the left lung. Superior segment of the left lower lobe is probably still atelectatic and moderate left pleural effusion may have migrated into the fissure. Careful followup advised for possible left lower lobe pneumonia. New vascular engorgement and borderline interstitial edema are evident in the right lung. No pneumothorax.
