Mild cardiomegaly is new and mediastinal veins are dilated, but there is no pulmonary vascular congestion, edema, or pleural effusion. Findings suggest either right ventricular decompensation or developing pericardial effusion. Large calcifications in the right upper mediastinum either heavy granulomatous calcifications in lymph nodes or extremely large atherosclerotic arterial plaques.
