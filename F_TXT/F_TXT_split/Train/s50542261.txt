AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Lung volumes are consistently low. Moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved since ___, but there is still considerable opacification in the lungs, particularly the left lower lobe which is probably collapsed. Moderate pleural effusion is still present, heart is still moderately enlarged and mediastinal veins are dilated. Tracheostomy tube tip abuts the left tracheal wall, as before. Right supraclavicular central venous catheter ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction, but probably in the right atrium, would need to be withdrawn 2 cm to reposition it with certainty low in the SVC, that is what is desired. No pneumothorax.
