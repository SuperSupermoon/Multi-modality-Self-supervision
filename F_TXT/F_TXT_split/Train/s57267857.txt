In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the left pigtail catheter is been removed an there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Otherwise little change except for the Dobhoff tube, which apparently was pushed forward has coiled on itself so that the tip is in the upper stomach pointing upwards. The endotracheal tube is not visualized on this study.
