Again seen is near complete opacification of the left hemithorax, likely secondary to known loculated pleural effusions as seen on prior chest CT. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is shifted to the left, likely reflecting volume loss. Calcifications are seen along the aortic knob. Patchy streaky opacities at the right lung base are likely reflective of atelectasis, with minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle which could be secondary to a small amount of pleural fluid.
