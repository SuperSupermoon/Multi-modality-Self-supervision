There are bibasilar airspace opacities new compared to the prior study. Left lower lobe atelectasis also noted however the appearances are suspicious for aspiration. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature which appears hazy consistent with a degree of congestive heart failure. The projection precludes assessment of the heart size however prominence of the hila suggest a degree of congestive heart failure. Probable small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax seen.
