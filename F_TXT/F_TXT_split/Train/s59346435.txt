In comparison with the earlier study of this date, of the endotracheal tube has been removed and replaced with a tracheostomy tube that appears to be well as positioned without evidence of complication. The patient is somewhat oblique when compared to the previous study. This may account for the apparent increased opacification at the right base. There does appear to be some relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour. A in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of volume loss in the right lower lung could be considered. A repeat study without obliquity of the patient is recommended for further evaluation.
