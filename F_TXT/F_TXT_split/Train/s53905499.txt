As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including two chest tubes, an endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and a left subclavian access line, are unchanged. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions that might have minimally increased in extent. Increasing areas of atelectasis at both lung bases. No evidence of pneumothorax, notably on the left. The tip of the endotracheal tube is 1 cm above the carina, tube should be pulled back by approximately 1 cm. No new areas of parenchymal opacities are noted.
