AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette is certainly consistent with pericardial effusion, or cardiomyopathy. Of note, mediastinal veins are not distended, even though such engorgement is usually an accompaniment of cardiac tamponade. Bibasilar atelectasis is mild and small bilateral pleural effusions are present, left greater than right. There is no pneumothorax. Mild scoliosis is an incidental finding.
