AP chest compared to ___ and ___ at 4:53 a.m.: Right upper lung is partially re-expanded. Middle and lower lobes remain collapsed and moderate to large right pleural effusion is larger now than it was prior to the right upper lobe collapse at 8 p.m. on ___. Pulmonary edema has improved in the left lung, moderate left pleural effusion is smaller, but there is still mild edema in the small region of aerated right lung. Cardiac silhouette appears to be getting smaller, but the determination is difficult because the right heart border is obscured by atelectasis. Left paramedian pericardiocentesis catheter ending above the left pulmonary artery is unchanged in position as is the dialysis catheter ending in the right atrium and low SVC. No pneumothorax. Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 9:15 a.m.
