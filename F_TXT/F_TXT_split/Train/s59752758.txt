Upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates adequate lung volumes, with minimal residual left basilar opacity. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged, with post-operative mediastinal prominence. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions. A left axillary pacemaker is unchanged in appearance, median sternotomy wires are again noted.
