Heart size appears normal. Aortic knob calcifications are noted. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. A moderate to large right pleural effusion is demonstrated. Right basilar opacity may reflect compressive atelectasis. Infection is not excluded. Left lung is grossly clear. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. No pneumothorax is seen though assessment of the apices is somewhat obscured by the patient's neck soft tissues. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine with osteophyte formation.
