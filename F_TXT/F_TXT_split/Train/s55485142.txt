In comparison with the study of ___, there are substantially lower lung volumes with atelectatic changes at the bases. Little change in the appearance of the left chest tube, which makes an abrupt turn inferiorly at the level of the aortic arch and has its distal tip at the level of the hemidiaphragm. No evidence of pneumothorax. The heart and lungs are otherwise unchanged.
