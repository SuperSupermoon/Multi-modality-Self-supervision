There is curvilinear density over the left upper lobe laterally, new compared with ___, which raises the question of a small pneumothorax. However, the appearance is somewhat atypical and no correlative finding is identified on the ___ chest CT. The differential could include artifact due to a skin fold. No obvious right apical pneumothorax is identified. Possible mild interval increase in upper zone redistribution. Otherwise, allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal and pleural slight parenchymal findings are overall similar. Incidental note is made of marked narrowing of the right rotator cuff interval, consists with chronic rotator cuff tear and severe glenohumeral osteoarthritis bilaterally .
