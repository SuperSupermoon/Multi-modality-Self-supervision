AP chest compared to ___ through ___: There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. Small right pleural effusion accompanies chronic right lower lobe atelectasis. Status of atelectasis at the left lung base is somewhat less severe but probably chronic as well. Upper lungs are clear. Small left pleural effusion as seen on the nearly concurrent chest CT is non-hemorrhagic and presumably unrelated to line placement. Transvenous right atrial and left ventricular leads and right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead are in standard placements. Moderate cardiomegaly longstanding.
