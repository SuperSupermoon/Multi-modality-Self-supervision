Supine portable chest radiograph through the chest demonstrates interval repositioning of the endotracheal tube which now appears 4 cm above the level of the carina, in appropriate position in this patient whose chin appears down. An enteric tube descends the thorax along the expected course of the esophagus, termination in the stomach in unchanged position when compared to prior radiograph. There has been interval placement of a right sided central line whose tip appears to terminate at the level of the cavoatrial junction. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The heart appears stably enlarged. The left hemithorax appears better aerated. There is no large pleural effusion. No focal opacity is identified concerning for pneumonia. Persistent mild vascular congestion is present without overt edema. A partially visualized aortic graft is noted.
