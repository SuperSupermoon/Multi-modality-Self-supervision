Slightly rotated positioning. There are low inspiratory volumes. A left-sided pacemaker type device is present, with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle. Perhaps due to positioning or technique, continuity of the right ventricular lead cannot be confirmed on these images. There is probable cardiomegaly, including prominence of the right heart. Mild unfolding of the aorta. Mild prominence of the vascular markings is noted, though this is likely accentuated by low lung volumes. There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis. No definite consolidation. No gross effusion. No pneumo thorax detected.
