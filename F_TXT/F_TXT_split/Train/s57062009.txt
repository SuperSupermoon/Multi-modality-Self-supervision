Lordotic positioning. Compared with ___ at 05:40, an ET tube is now present, tip borderline low, 1.9 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Left IJ central line tip again overlies the distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured, but probably unchanged. Again seen is hazy density in the right mid can lower zones, consistent with pleural effusion can underlying collapse and/or consolidation. The degree of vascular plethora in the right upper zone may be slightly increased, but there is also considerable artifact due to overlying materials. On the left, no overt CHF. Patchy opacity at the retrocardiac region is similar to the prior film. No left effusion. Old healed right rib fractures and tapered left clavicle again noted.
