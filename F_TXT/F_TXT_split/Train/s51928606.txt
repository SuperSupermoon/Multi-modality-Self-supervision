There is diffuse of opacification of the right lung base, likely a combination of layering moderate size pleural effusion and atelectasis. Left basilar opacity also likely reflects a small to moderate size pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular edema is present. Unchanged enlargement of the thoracic aorta and pulmonary arteries. Deviation of the upper trachea by a right superior mediastinal mass, previously shown to be a calcified thyroid nodule on CT chest from ___, is unchanged. No pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.
