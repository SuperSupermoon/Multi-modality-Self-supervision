In comparison with the study of ___, there is again diffuse patchy opacification involving the right hemithorax with 8 generalized haziness, most likely representing layering pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis and continued mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The large spiculated mass is again seen in the right perihilar region. Again, CT would be necessary for further characterization of this process.
