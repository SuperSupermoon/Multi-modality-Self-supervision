Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained. New left basal consolidative opacity has developed in the interim from the previous examination with faint right basal opacity and linear atelectasis. Given the appearance of aspiration on the previous chest CT, findings are most suggestive of aspiration. A G-tube is incompletely assessed on the lower edge of the image. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
