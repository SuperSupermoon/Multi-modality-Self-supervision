Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
