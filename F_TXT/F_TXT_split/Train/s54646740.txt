As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. A zone of right medial basal parenchymal opacity, with some air bronchograms, is neither increased nor decreased in extent. As noted in the previous report, the change could reflect aspiration or developing pneumonia and should undergo continued radiographic monitoring. No other parenchymal lesions or changes are seen. Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
