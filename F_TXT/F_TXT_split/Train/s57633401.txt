In comparison with study of ___, there are midline sternal wires in place. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2.4 cm above the carina. Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is in the pulmonary outflow tract. Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the side hole is probably in the distal esophagus. Bilateral chest tubes are in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small effusion. Poor definition of engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with some element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
