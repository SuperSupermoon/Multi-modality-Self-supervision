Low lung volumes are re-demonstrated on this AP radiograph. There is also distention of the splenic flexure, new. There is no definitive new consolidation seen except for mild opacity that appears to be increased in the right middle lobe. No interval increase in pleural effusion or development of pneumothorax.
