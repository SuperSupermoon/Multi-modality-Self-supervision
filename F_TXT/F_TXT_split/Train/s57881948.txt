The endotracheal tube is positioned low with the tip in the proximal right main stem bronchus. A right internal jugular catheter and a left hemodialysis catheter are in unchanged position with the tip near the cavoatrial junction. The lung volumes are persistently low. There is stable mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and basilar opacities, likely atelectasis. The apices of lungs are clear. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, possibly slightly increased from the prior exam. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with persistent severe cardiomegaly.
