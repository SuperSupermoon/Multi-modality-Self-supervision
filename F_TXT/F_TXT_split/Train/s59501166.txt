Since the prior chest radiograph, there has been interval placement of an NG tube that terminates in the body of the stomach. There is also a new right-sided PICC line that terminates in the distal SVC. Right-sided port and the chest tube at the right lung base are unchanged in position. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right are not significantly changed compared to prior. There is also worsening bilateral patchy opacities likely due to pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
