The heart is enlarged and the aorta is tortuous and calcified as before. Lung volumes are low which accentuates bronchovascular markings. There is pulmonary vascular congestion with mild pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities are most consistent with bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral effusions however underlying infection should be considered in the appropriate setting. A right humeral prosthesis is demonstrated. A large hiatal hernia projects over the heart unchanged from the prior.
