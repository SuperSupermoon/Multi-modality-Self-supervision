A tracheostomy catheter terminates at the level of the carina and should be re-adjusted. A large caliber central venous catheter from a right approach terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There are low lung volumes bilaterally resulting in bronchovascular crowding. An opacity within the left base may be a combination of atelectasis and effusion, though infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is evident. There is no interstitial pulmonary edema. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. A rounded density in the right glenoid may be a bone island.
