Radiograph centered at thoracoabdominal junction was obtained to assess placement of an orogastric tube, which terminates in the stomach. Cardiac silhouette has slightly decreased in size and is accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion and improved pulmonary edema with only minimal residual interstitial edema remaining. Improving left retrocardiac atelectasis, but worsening opacity at the right lung base with associated change in contour of the right hemidiaphragm. Observed findings could represent a subpulmonic right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis or consolidation. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. Diffuse haziness in the imaged upper abdomen is consistent with known ascites on recent abdominal CT.
