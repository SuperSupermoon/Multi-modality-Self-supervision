Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. A left-sided Port-A-Cath is seen terminating in the deep right atrium. Since the prior study, there has been interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities which may relate to effusions and atelectasis with possible underlying consolidation. Perihilar opacities are seen which may be due to underlying pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the bibasilar opacities. The mediastinal contours are similar given lower lung volumes.
