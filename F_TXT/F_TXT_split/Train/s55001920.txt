As compared to the previous radiograph, the tube is slightly lower. Its tip now projects 1 cm above the carina. The tube should be pulled back by approximately 1-2 cm to avoid accidental intubation of a main bronchus. The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable. The tip of the tube is not visualized on the image. Right internal jugular vein catheter and left dialysis catheter are constant. Low lung volumes with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Moderate cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis.
