The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Asymmetric heterogeneous opacification suggests multifocal pneumonia in the right lung. Right mid lung opacities are vague but somewhat rounded so septic nodules are possible this may perhaps be explained primarily by pneumonia. There is also a fairly well defined right infrahilar opacity suggesting pneumonia with air bronchograms. In addition, although more diffuse vague bilateral opacification may also be due to infection, coinciding pulmonary edema is suspected. There are probably small pleural effusions.
