Compared to the prior film, multiple lines and tubes have been removed. The right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is been converted to right IJ sheath, with tip over distal most SVC. The two prosthetic valves are noted. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is again noted to be prominent, consistent with recent surgery. Although it appears more pronounced than on the prior film, this may relate to technical differences. On today's exam, there is more pronounced vascular plethora, with diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. Again seen is patchy retrocardiac opacity. Possible small bilateral effusions. No pneumothorax detected.
