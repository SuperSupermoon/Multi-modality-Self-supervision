As compared to the previous radiograph, a decrease in severity of the pre-existing pulmonary edema is noted. The known upper lobe opacities, notably on the right, are slightly more severe than on the previous image. Minimal basal areas of atelectasis on the right. Large known hiatal hernia. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the presence of a pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
