AP chest compared to ___: Low lung volumes and slightly more lordotic positioning today than yesterday may account in part for slight increase in heart size. Aside from mild left basal atelectasis, lungs are clear, and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The stomach is now moderately distended with gas. Endotracheal tube, with the chin down, is in standard position, no less than 23 mm above the carina.
