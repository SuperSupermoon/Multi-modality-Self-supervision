The lung volumes are very low. Greater opacification at the lung bases could be combination of dependent edema atelectasis and pleural effusions. The region is not seen well enough to exclude pneumonia. The upper lungs are clear and pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Large cardiac silhouette and mediastinal venous engorgement are stable. No pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC.
