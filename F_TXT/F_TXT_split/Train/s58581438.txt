Right-sided chest drains in situ. The right apical lateral pneumothorax measuring 20 mm in diameter is unchanged in size compared to prior radiograph, but appears to be filled with fluid. Increased density seen in the right cardiophrenic angle. The second density just superior to this may be loculated pleural fluid collection, but is difficult on a single AP radiograph. Transverse cardiomegaly unchanged. Persistent left lower lobe consolidation with bronchograms seen within. No pulmonary edema. No large effusions. Right-sided Port-A-Cath in situ with the tip at the cavoatrial junction. Subcutaneous gas seen in the right chest wall and right supraclavicular area.
