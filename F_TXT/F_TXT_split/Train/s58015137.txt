The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A PICC line has been removed. Rightward shift of mediastinal structures is partly positional but suggests there may be atelectasis with volume loss at the right lung base to some degree. The pulmonary vasculature is hazy and mild vascular congestion is suspected. It is difficult to exclude pleural effusions, at least of small size. The bones are probably demineralized.
