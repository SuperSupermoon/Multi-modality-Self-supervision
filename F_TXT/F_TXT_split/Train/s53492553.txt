The tip of the right PICC line projects over the superior cavoatrial junction. There is increased aeration involving the right mid to lower lung zone with a persisting more confluent opacity located peripherally. Diffusely increased interstitial markings and patchy opacities still persist throughout both lungs. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
