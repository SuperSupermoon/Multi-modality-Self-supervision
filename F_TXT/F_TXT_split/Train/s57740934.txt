1. Moderate sized layering pleural effusions which are likely slightly increased since the previous study, although the majority of the difference is felt to be related to supine positioning on the current examination. The pulmonary vasculature appears somewhat more prominent, which does suggest a component of superimposed perihilar edema. Bibasilar opacities are consistent with compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen. Hardware overlies the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine. A right subclavian central line has its tip in the distal superior vena cava. Another catheter seen overlying the right lower thorax, although its location is difficult to ascertain on this single projection. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax. Cardiac size is difficult to assess due to the bibasilar airspace opacities.
