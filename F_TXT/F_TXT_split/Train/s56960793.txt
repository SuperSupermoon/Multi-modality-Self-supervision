There are diffuse lung opacities, right greater than left, new from prior and worrisome for asymmetric pulmonary edema. Given relative increased density of the right base, a right lower lobe pneumonia is not excluded. No large effusion is identified. Enlargement and indistinctness of the hila is likely secondary to vascular engorgement. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette likely due to edema. There is no pneumothorax.
