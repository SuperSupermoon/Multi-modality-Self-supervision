Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. An NG tube is seen extending along the midline with its tip coiled in the distal esophagus and the distal tip extending cephalexin in the mid esophagus region. This positioning is unchanged from prior exam. Please advance for more optimal positioning. Since the prior exam, there is again noted to be extensive pulmonary airspace consolidation, slightly more confluent in the right lung, concerning for pneumonia. Air bronchograms are noted in the left lower lobe. Bony structures are intact. The possibility of pulmonary edema is also raised. No large effusions are seen. Old right clavicular deformity noted.
