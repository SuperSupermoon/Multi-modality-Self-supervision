Endotracheal tube somewhat low in position, terminating approximately 1 cm above the carina. Recommend withdrawal by approximately 2 cm for more optimal positioning. Interval removal of left-sided subclavian line. Enteric tube is similar in position. Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No new focal consolidation is seen. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to atelectasis versus a trace effusion. No pulmonary edema is seen.
