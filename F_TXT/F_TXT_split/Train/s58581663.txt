A right subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the mid-to-low SVC. Feeding tube terminates above the GE junction and has been in similar position on prior radiographs. The heart is top normal in size. Hilar and mediastinal contours are stable. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions remain unchanged. There has been interval improvement of diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, likely reflective of improving pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
