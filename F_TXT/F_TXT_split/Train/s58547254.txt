Mild postoperative pulmonary edema has redistributed, but not disappeared, accompanied by increasing small to moderate pleural effusions and new left lower lobe collapse. There is no pneumothorax. Postoperative widening of the upper mediastinum could be due to the venous engorgement or accumulation of fluid or blood. Careful followup advised.
