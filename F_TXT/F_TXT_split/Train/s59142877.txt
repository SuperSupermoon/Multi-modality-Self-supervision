Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple closure devices seen. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with overlying atelectasis. Mild left basilar atelectasis is also seen. Streaky, linear medial right basilar opacity may relate to atelectasis or vascular structures overlying the elevated right hemidiaphragm, consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting, although is felt less likely. If patient able, this could be further evaluated on dedicated PA and lateral views of the chest. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. No large pleural effusion is seen, although trace pleural effusion on the left will be difficult to exclude. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
