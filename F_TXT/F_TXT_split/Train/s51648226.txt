The patient has been intubated. Endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its tip lying beyond the inferior margin of the fell. The lungs appear clear. There no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. There may have been an interval non-displaced fracture involving the left fifth rib, but probably not acute.
