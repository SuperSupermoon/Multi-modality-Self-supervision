AP chest compared to ___, 9:47 p.m.: Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn to standard position, tip roughly 3.5 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Low lung volumes exaggerate mild cardiomegaly, and supine positioning makes mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement more prominent than it probably is. No pulmonary edema. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
