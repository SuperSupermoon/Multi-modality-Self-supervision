Normal heart size. Normal hilar contours. Increased opacity at the right base with complete obscuration of the contours of both the right hemidiaphragm and right heart border and rightward mediastinal shaft reflect complete collapse of the right middle lobe and worsening of severe right lower lobe atelectasis. The left costophrenic sulcus is not imaged, but the remainder of the left lung is clear. No pneumothorax. New, small region of consolidation in the right upper lobe close to the fissures could be early pneumonia, and, along with persistent atelectasis due to aspiration or uncleared bronchial secretions. Minimal pulmonary edema is unchanged.
