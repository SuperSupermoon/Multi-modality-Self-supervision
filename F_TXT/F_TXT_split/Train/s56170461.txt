No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison. Slightly rotated positioning. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged. There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. There is some patchy opacity at the left greater than right bases, presumably representing atelectasis. There is tenting of the right hemidiaphragm medially -- this is also likely related to atelectasis. No gross effusion is identified. If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help to better characterize the opacities at both bases.
