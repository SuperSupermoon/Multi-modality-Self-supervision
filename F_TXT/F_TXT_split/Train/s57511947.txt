No free air is detected beneath diaphragm. Air seen under the left hemidiaphragm is more suggestive of gas within the gastric fundus or, less likely, within a splenic flexure. A few air-filled loops of bowel are seen in the lower abdomen. These could represent mildly dilated loops of small bowel, possibly with fluid levels, but are not fully evaluated on this examination. The prominent - this distention seen in the upper abdomen on the film from ___ is not appreciated on the current upright film. The heart is not enlarged. There is no CHF, focal infiltrate or fusion. No pneumothorax is detected. There is moderate sigmoid scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine, right convex lower thoracic and left convex in the upper lumbar spine, with a rotary component lumbar spine.
