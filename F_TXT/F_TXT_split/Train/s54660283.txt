Bronchovascular markings are accentuated by extremely low lung volumes. There is hazy opacification in the left lower hemithorax, which may be due to a small pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis; this appears worse when compared to the prior radiograph. The possibility of a small left apical pneumothorax was raised on yesterday's chest x-ray, but this is not seen on today's exam. A new oval shaped opacity is seen along the periphery of the left hemithorax, likely representing pleural effusion. Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette. Minimal left cervical and lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema, stable in appearance. Thoracic spine fusion device is unchanged in position. Fractures of the left lateral ___ - 7th ribs are likely acute. Right internal jugular introducer and left chest tube are unchanged in position.
