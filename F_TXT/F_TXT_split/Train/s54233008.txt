As compared to the previous examination, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 4 cm above the carina. All other findings are constant, with the exception of slightly decreased lung volumes, that exaggerate the visual appearance of the thickness of the pulmonary vessels. No complications, no pneumothorax.
