As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal tube has been slightly pulled back. The tube is now located 8 cm above the carina and could be advanced by 2-3 cm. The other monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The lung volumes have increased, potentially as a consequence of increased ventilatory pressure. Retrocardiac atelectasis, however, is unchanged. On today's examination, there is mild blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting the presence of a left pleural effusion.
