As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are constant. There is massive cardiomegaly and a mild left pleural effusion. On the right, minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinus could indicate presence of a small right pleural effusion as well. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities at the right lung bases are constant in extent and severity. At the left, areas of retrocardiac atelectasis are seen. Overall, the image also reflects mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
