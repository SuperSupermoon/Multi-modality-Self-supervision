Right upper lobe atelectasis has improved, but there may be new collapse of the middle lobe elevated against the minor fissure. Right lower lobe consolidation, presumably another region of atelectasis, is stable. Left lung remains clear. Heart size is normal. Small right pleural effusion is likely. Feeding tube with the wire stylet in place ends just beyond the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced 5-10 cm for more secure seating. Left subclavian line is been removed. Left PIC line ends just above the superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax or left pleural effusion.
