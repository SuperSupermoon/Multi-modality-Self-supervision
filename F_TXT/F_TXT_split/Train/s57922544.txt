A right internal jugular central venous catheter has been placed. Its tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction. An endotracheal tube terminates about 6 cm of the carina, somewhat more proximal than seen previously. The lung volumes remain low. The lungs appear clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.
