Portable radiograph of the chest shows a new right internal jugular central venous line with the tip in the low SVC. The endotracheal tube tip projects approximately 1 cm from the carina. This should be retracted by approximately 2 cm for proper positioning. The lung volumes are decreased compared to the prior study with bibasilar atelectasis and increased opacities at the left base, suggestive of aspiration. The cardiac shadow is exaggerated due to the low lung volumes. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
