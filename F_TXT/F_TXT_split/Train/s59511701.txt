Bilateral lung volumes are low. Bilateral hemidiaphragms are not elevated. The right hemidiaphragm contour is obscured from lung opacities, likely atelectasis. Increased retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung atelectasis is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are similar. Prominant mediastinal contour and heart size is attributed to at least some extent from low lung volumes. Spinal fusion devices is present in the lower thoracic spine. Right chest tube ends near the right lung apex.
