The patient is rotated significantly to the left. The left costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. There is patchy right basilar opacity which could be due to aspiration or infection. There is also patchy left basilar opacity which could be due to atelectasis, although aspiration at that location is not excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
