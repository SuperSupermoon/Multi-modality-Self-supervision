Lung volumes are low, leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen. Stable, moderate to severe cardiomegaly is noted. The aorta is tortuous and contains atherosclerotic calcifications. Mediastinal contours are otherwise stable. Redemonstrated is a metallic density seen projecting over the heart, which may relate to a prior cardiac surgery. A left ventriculoperitoneal shunt is noted.
