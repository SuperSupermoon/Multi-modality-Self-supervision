Single AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a nasogastric tube which appears to be looped within the upper esophagus. Lung volumes are low. Allowing for this, cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are similar and within normal limits. There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. No focal opacity is identified bilaterally. There is no air under the right hemidiaphragm.
