Single semi-upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of a right-sided PICC, terminating in the upper to mid SVC. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle with a patchy right basilar opacity is similar to prior, likely representing chronic pleural thickening with associated atelectasis/scarring. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Left lung is grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax.
