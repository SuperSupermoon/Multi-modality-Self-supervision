AP chest compared to ___: Severe widespread somewhat asymmetric pulmonary opacification probably pulmonary edema in most lung regions, but I cannot exclude pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage in the left perihilar and lower lung zone. Cardiomegaly is moderate to severe. Transvenous right atrial and ventricular pacer leads are continuous from the left axillary power pack. Pleural effusions are presumed, and could be small but not large. No pneumothorax.
