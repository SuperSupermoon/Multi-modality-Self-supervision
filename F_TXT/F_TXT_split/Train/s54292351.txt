Right subclavian line is unchanged in position. Right basilar chest tube remains in place. A basilar left chest tube remains in place with the second tube having been removed. There is marked interval improvement in aeration within the left lung with residual patchy opacity in the mid lung. This may reflect residual atelectasis, although contusion should also be considered as this opacity is in the same vicinity as the previous chest tube. No large effusion is seen. The patient is status post median sternotomy with CABG and valve replacement and stable postoperative mediastinal and cardiac contours. There is a stable small right apicolateral pneumothorax. No definite pneumothorax is seen on the left. No pulmonary edema.
