The patient is status post median sternotomy. There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube, mediastinal drains and right Swan-Ganz catheter, and a right central venous sheath is still in place. There continues to be left retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. There are no new focal consolidations or pneumothoraces.
