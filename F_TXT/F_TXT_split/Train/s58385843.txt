The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal and stable. Increasing hilar fullness and increasing bilateral opacities suggest pulmonary vascular congestion and increasing pulmonary edema. A more confluent area of opacity at the left base may represent atelectasis or infection in the appropriate clinical setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Multiple granulomas are stable in the right lung.
