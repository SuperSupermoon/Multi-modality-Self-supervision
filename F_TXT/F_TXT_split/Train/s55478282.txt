A semi-upright portable chest radiograph shows sternal hardware status post mitral valve replacement with the radiodense portion of the prosthetic valve visible. A Swan-Ganz catheter is in place at the level of the main pulmonary artery, directed slightly to the right. There appears to be more obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm than seen on yesterday's study where subsegmental atelectasis is suggested and there is new or increased streaky consolidation in the left upper lung zone, very slight consolidation in the right costophrenic angle. Endotracheal tube and chest tube seen on yesterday's study has been removed and no pneumothorax is seen.
