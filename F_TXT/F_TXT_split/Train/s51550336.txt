Endotracheal tube terminates 2.6 cm above the carina. Particularly as the head is extended, any further movement centrally could result in unilateral intubation. New orogastric tube terminates just beyond the GE junction and could be advanced 7 to 10 cm. Bilateral chest tubes are redemonstrated, without evidence of pneumothorax. Left subclavian central venous catheter appears to be located in the distal subclavian or proximal left brachiocephalic vein. Left sided arterial line terminates in the axilla. The lungs are low in volume with developing opacity in the left upper lobe. Tortuous and unfolded aorta is noted with calcification. The heart is normal in size. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
