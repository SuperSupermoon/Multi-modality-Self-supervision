In comparison to ___ radiograph, endotracheal tube remains relatively high, terminating about 7 cm above the carina. This could be advanced a few cm for standard positioning. Moderate left pleural effusion has apparently slightly increased in size with persistent adjacent atelectasis at the left base. No other relevant change.
