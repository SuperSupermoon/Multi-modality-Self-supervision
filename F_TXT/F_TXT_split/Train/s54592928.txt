In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. Engorged pulmonary vessels are consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. There are bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases. The area of possible increased opacification just above the minor fissure on the right is no longer present. There is a region of opacification at the right base medially. This could well represent effusion and vascular engorgement. However, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
