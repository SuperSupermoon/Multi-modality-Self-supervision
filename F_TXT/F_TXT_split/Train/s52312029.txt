Evaluation is slightly limited due to patient's positioning. Within this limitation, the patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal contours are prominent, which is related in part to unfolding of the thoracic aorta and patient's positioning with slight rotation to the right. The hilar contours appear unchanged. The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated compared to the left. The inspiratory lung volumes remain low. Streaky opacification of the right lung base is increased, which may represent worsening atelectasis. Mild opacification of the left lung base most likely reflects atelectasis. A small right pleural effusion is present. The left costophrenic angle is clear. No pneumothorax is detected.
