Endotracheal tube remains in standard position. Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach with distal tip directed cephalad in the fundus. Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. Multifocal heterogeneous lung opacities have slightly improved and are superimposed on a background of emphysema. Observed findings could represent multifocal aspiration and/or multifocal pneumonia. Possible small bilateral pleural effusions, but no evidence of pneumothorax.
