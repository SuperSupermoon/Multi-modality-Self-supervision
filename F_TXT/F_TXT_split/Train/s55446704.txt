Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube has been advanced; the tip is 2.5 cm above the carina. The left subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. The lung volumes and cardiomediastinal silhouette are unchanged. Left upper lobe atelectasis has increased. Vascular engorgement has minimally worsened. Bibasilar atelectases have increased on the left. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
