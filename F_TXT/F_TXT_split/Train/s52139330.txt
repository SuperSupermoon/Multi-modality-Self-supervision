In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right IJ catheter has been pulled back to about the cavoatrial junction. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is essentially unchanged, as is the right subclavian catheter. There is a small amount of increased opacification at both bases, most likely representing atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered. Of incidental note is a spinal fusion device in the lumbar region and at least 1 level of kyphoplasty.
