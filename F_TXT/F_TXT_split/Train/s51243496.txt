AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained 12 hours earlier during the same day. During the interval, the patient has been extubated and a tracheostomy was performed. The tracheal cannula is in place, seen to terminate in the trachea some 6 cm above the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. Previously described central venous line is in unchanged position. NG tube has been removed. Cardiac enlargement as before and the rather massive pleural effusions persist. No evidence of new infiltrates.
