As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The lung volumes have slightly increased, potentially reflecting increased ventilatory pressures. Unchanged atelectasis at the bases of the right upper lobe and in the retrocardiac lung regions. Mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. No new focal parenchymal opacities that would suggest pneumonia.
