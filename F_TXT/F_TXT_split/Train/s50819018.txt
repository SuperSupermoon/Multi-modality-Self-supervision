Right IJ central line seen in the upper SVC. Mediastinal chest tubes identified in place. Low lung volumes seen on the current exam. The lungs are clear of large confluent consolidation. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for technique and low lung volumes. Median sternotomy wires are now seen. Osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable, noting surgical clips in the right upper quadrant.
