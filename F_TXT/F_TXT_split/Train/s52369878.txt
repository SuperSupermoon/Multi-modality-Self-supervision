Single portable view of the chest. There is a large left-sided pneumothorax with atelectasis of the left lung and mediastinal shift to the right. Endotracheal tube still remains low with tip approximately 1.3 cm from the carina. The enteric tube is seen with tip in the region of the gastric fundus, side port not visualized, but potentially in the lower esophagus. Increased opacity in the right lung is likely due to atelectasis.
