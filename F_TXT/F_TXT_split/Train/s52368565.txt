Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right atrium. Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures as a result low volumes. Pulmonary vascular engorgement is likely present as well as patchy opacities in the lung bases most likely reflective of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly visualized. A clip projects over the left aspect of the neck.
