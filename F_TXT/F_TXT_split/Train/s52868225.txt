Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Two chest tubes project over the right hemithorax. There is a small right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Right-sided Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The left lung is essentially clear.
