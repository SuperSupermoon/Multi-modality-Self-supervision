Pulmonary edema cleared between ___ and ___. There is still substantial opacification in both lung bases, and it is not entirely clear how much is due to pleural effusions and how much due to atelectasis. CT scanning would be helpful in that regard. The pulmonary hila are substantially enlarged, presumably due to pulmonary hypertension, but possibility of pulmonary emboli should be entertained clinically. Moderate enlarged twin of the cardiac silhouette is stable. The mitral annulus is heavily calcified which might have contributed to mitral regurgitation and pulmonary edema. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. Right PIC line ends in the mid to low SVC.
