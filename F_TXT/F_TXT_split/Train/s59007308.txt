Current study demonstrates small amount of left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumothorax. Left mediastinal shift is present and most likely reflects persistent area of left lower lobe atelectasis. Right lung is well aerated. Small amount of right pleural effusion and minimal basal atelectasis are present. Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess, note is made that on ___, pericardial effusion had been demonstrated. Substantial left mediastinal shift of the trachea and narrowing of the coronal diameter of the trachea are related to multinodular goiter, better assessed on the CT chest with substantial retrosternal component.
