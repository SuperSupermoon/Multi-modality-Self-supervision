A single portable frontal upright view of the chest was obtained. There is interval development of diffuse bilateral opacities, consistent with pulmonary edema and moderate bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis. Rounded density in the right lower lung probably reflects loculated pleural fluid. The cardiac silhouette is partially masked by the effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
