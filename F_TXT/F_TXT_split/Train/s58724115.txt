Lung volumes are slightly low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears mild to moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications again noted at the aortic knob. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Calcified granulomas are seen within both upper lobes. Linear opacity in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Degenerative changes are seen within the upper lumbar spine. Cholecystectomy clips are demonstrated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
