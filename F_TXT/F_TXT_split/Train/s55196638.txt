AP chest compared to ___: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, have both increased. Lung bases are obscured, but there appears to be opacification in both lower lungs, whether atelectasis or pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate and a more discrete mass-like 22 mm wide lesion at the upper pole of the left hilus, which could be a metastasis, less likely, infection. Cardiac silhouette is obscured. There is no pneumothorax. Right supraclavicular central venous infusion pump ends in the right atrium. Dr. ___ paged today at 8:20 a.m. as soon as the findings were recognized.
