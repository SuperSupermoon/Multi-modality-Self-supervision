The right IJ central line has been removed. The tracheostomy and left-sided central line are unchanged in position. Heart size is within normal limits. There has been worsening of the airspace opacities particularly at the right base and left mid lung field since the previous study. Superimposed pulmonary edema would be difficult to exclude; however, the vascular pedicle is not widened, thus this is felt less likely. No pneumothoraces are seen.
