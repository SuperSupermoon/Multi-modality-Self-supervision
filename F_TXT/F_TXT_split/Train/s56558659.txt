Mild pulmonary edema may be minimally worse in the interval. Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis, but aspiration or infection is not completely excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Clips from prior cholecystectomy are noted in the right upper quadrant.
