An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 5.9 cm above the carina and lies at the level of the clavicular heads. The tip of a left subclavian line overlies the distal SVC. No pneumothorax detected. There are bilateral effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, including prominence of the SVC, is enlarged, but unchanged. Compared with ___ at 05:42, the CHF findings may be slightly worse, but the appearance is otherwise unchanged.
