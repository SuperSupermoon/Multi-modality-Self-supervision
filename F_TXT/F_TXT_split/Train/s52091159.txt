Right internal jugular central venous catheter remains in standard position within the proximal-to-mid superior vena cava. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and is accompanied by upper zone vascular redistribution. Bilateral pleural effusions are present, small to moderate on the left and small on the right. The right effusion has apparently increased since the prior study, but positional differences between the exams limit comparison. Adjacent areas of retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis associated with the effusions, but infectious consolidation is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
