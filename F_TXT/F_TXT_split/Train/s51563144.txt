Assessment is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.5 cm from the carina. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the proximal right atrium. A orogastric tube tip courses below the diaphragm, into the stomach, and off the inferior borders of the film. Lung volumes are low. There is moderate to severe cardiomegaly. Widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to low lung volumes and supine positioning. There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Consolidative opacities in the lung bases are concerning for areas of infection. Patchy opacities in the left lung as well as in the right upper lung field may reflect areas of infection or aspiration. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
