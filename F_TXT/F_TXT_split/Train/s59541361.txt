In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much better inspiration. A left pigtail catheter is in place and there has been substantial clearing of the large left effusion. No definite pneumothorax is appreciated. Increased opacification in the left mid and lower zones could reflect re-expansion edema or, in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia. Poor definition of lower lung vessels raises the possibility of increased pulmonary venous pressure in a patient with hyperexpansion upper lobes consistent with chronic pulmonary disease and bullous changes.
