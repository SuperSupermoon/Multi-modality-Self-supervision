In comparison with the earlier study this date, the right hemidiaphragm in heart border are now sharply seen, consistent with re-expansion of the right middle and lower lobe, possibly related to a expectoration of a mucous plugging. The generalized prominence of interstitial markings has substantially reduced, suggesting that some of this could have represented vascular congestion. Nevertheless, patchy areas of opacification persist on both sides, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of multifocal pneumonia. Right subclavian catheter again extends to the upper portion of the SVC.
