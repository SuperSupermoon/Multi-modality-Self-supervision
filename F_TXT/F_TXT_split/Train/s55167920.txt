AP portable supine view of the chest. Endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located 2.3 cm above the carinal. The orogastric tube extends into the upper abdomen though the tip is excluded from view. Mild edema is noted with hilar congestion and mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Lower lung opacities could reflect aspiration. No supine evidence for large effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable. No bony injuries.
