Single portable view of the chest shows mildly low lung volumes, accentuating the cardiopulmonary contours. Tiny clips project over the left lung base. The lungs are clear. Hilar and mediastinal contours are normal. No pleural abnormality is seen. Of note, right chest wall port is unchanged with the catheter tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction.
