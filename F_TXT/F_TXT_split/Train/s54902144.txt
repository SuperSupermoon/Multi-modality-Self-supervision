Single portable view of the chest. No prior. There are increased hazy opacities at the lung bases, right greater than left. This could be in part due to overlying soft tissues and portable technique. Superiorly, the lungs are clear of consolidation, although mild indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Median sternotomy wires are noted.
