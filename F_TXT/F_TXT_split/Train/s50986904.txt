In comparison with the study of ___, there is much less obliquity of the patient. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Persistent opacification at the bases with obliteration of the hemidiaphragms is again consistent with layering pleural effusions and volume loss in the lower lobes. Minimal indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. There is no evidence of mediastinal shift. The monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
