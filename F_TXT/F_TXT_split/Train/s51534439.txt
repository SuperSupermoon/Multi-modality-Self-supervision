Bilateral IJ catheters are unchanged in position. An endotracheal tube terminates 4.1 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube extends to at least the level of the stomach, with the tip excluded on this radiograph. Small bilateral pleural effusions are again seen, unchanged on the right and slightly worsened on the left. There is continued central pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax.
