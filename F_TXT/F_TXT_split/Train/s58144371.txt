Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Subtle, poorly defined opacities have developed in the right upper lobe as well as patchy and linear opacities in the left mid and both lower lung regions. Findings could reflect multifocal atelectasis or aspiration in this recently postoperative patient. Followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude developing aspiration pneumonia.
