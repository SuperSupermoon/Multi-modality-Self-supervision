Assessment is limited due to positioning. Allowing for this limitation, there is no pulmonary opacity or consolidation. No pleural effusion is identified. The heart is not enlarged. Apparent widening of the superior mediastinum is noted. An endotracheal tube ends 6.7 cm above the carina. An esophageal tube ends below the gastroesophageal junction, with the side port within the stomach. A left-sided venous line ends at the level of the left sternoclavicular joint.
