As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes are still low. There is a moderate right pleural effusion with blunting of the costophrenic sinus and areas of right basal atelectasis. The heart continues to be at the upper range of normal as regarding its size. A rounded parenchymal opacity at the left lung base, potentially caused by an area of lung contusion, is unchanged in severity. The monitoring and support devices are constant. The appearance of the displaced multiple known rib fractures is unchanged.
