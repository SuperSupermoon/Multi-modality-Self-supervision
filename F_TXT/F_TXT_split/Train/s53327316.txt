Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiac size is partially obscured by the lung abnormalities. There are low lung volumes. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are stable. Right lower lobe opacity has increased, could be due to increasing atelectasis. Mild vascular congestion is stable. Right mild lung opacity has increased, consistent with worsening infection. Diffuse irregular interstitial opacities are grossly unchanged.
