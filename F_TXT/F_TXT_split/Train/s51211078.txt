CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.8 cm above the carina, though it lies above the superior edge of the clavicles. An NG tube is present, tip and side port beneath diaphragm overlying stomach. Right IJ and left indwelling subclavian central line tips over distal SVC. No pneumothorax detected. Compared with ___ at 22:36 p.m., there has been a small amount of improvement in the right apical opacity -- the convex border of the opacity is much less pronounced. However, otherwise, the appearance is similar. Also again seen is dense consolidation at the left mid and lower zones, with air bronchograms and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a small right effusion. There is also focal opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, unchanged. Multiple clips over noted abdomen. The appearances are concerning for multifocal pneumonia, though other airspace filling processes may account for similar appearance. Clinical correlation regarding possible advancement of the ET tube requested.
