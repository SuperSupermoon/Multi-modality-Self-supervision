The ET tube is approximately 4.8 cm above the carina. The enteric tube terminates in the gastric fundus. The left IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. Moderate pulmonary edema and pulmonary venous congestion are unchanged. No new consolidation. However, with the presence of moderate pulmonary edema, superimposed multifocal pneumonia is difficult to rule out. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
