Single portable AP view of the chest was provided. The patient has been extubated. Lung volumes are low. Bilateral symmetric opacities are more likely atelectasis given the low lung volumes and recent extubation. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusions. The mediastinum is slightly widened, which may be positional. The heart size is top normal.
