A right-sided double barrel Port-A-Cath catheter terminates in the cavoatrial junction. As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is increased moderate to large left-sided pleural effusion. Right basal opacities have worsened and likely reflect a combination of pleural effusion and consolidation. Increased ill-defined opacity in the right lower lung could reflect worsened metastatic disease. Rounded opacity in the right perihilar region is compatible with known loculated fissural fluid, as seen on prior chest CT. There is no pneumothorax. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is somewhat limited, however the cardiomediastinal contour appears grossly stable when compared to prior examination.
