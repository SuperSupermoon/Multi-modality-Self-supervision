Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the proximal right atrium, unchanged. There are low lung volumes. The heart size appears mildly enlarged but stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are slightly widened, but this appears unchanged and is likely due to supine technique and low lung volumes. There is a small-to-moderate-sized left pleural effusion, and a small right pleural effusion, with improved aeration of the right lung base. There is persistent opacification in the left lung base, which could reflect an area of atelectasis, infection, or aspiration. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present, though mild pulmonary vascular congestion cannot be completely excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
