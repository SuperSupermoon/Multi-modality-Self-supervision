A right internal jugular catheter is in-situ, this is been withdrawn somewhat compared to the prior study. But still appears low, likely in the right atrium. This could be withdrawn a further 2 cm for better positioning within the SVC. Lung volumes remain low which may be contributing to this appearance. Left basilar atelectasis has progressed slightly compared to the prior study. The airspace opacity seen previously is less conspicuous on the current study.
