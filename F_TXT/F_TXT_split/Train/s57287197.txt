There is again seen in ET tube which terminates 5.3 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is seen with distal tip in the stomach. There is rightward rotation on the current radiograph. Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is increased interstitial prominence, and increased prominence of pulmonary vasculature with more indistinct margins, likely representing worsening pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no overt pulmonary edema. There is new bibasilar linear atelectasis. In the left upper lung, there are what appears to be pleural-based calcifications; it is recommended to correlate with previous studies if available. If not, it is recommended to obtain non-emergent chest CT for further evaluation. There are no pneumothoraces or effusions.
