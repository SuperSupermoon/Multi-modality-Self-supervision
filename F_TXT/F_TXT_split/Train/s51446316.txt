There are low lung volumes. The heart size is top normal with a left ventricular predominance. The aorta remains tortuous. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Streaky opacities in the lung bases are present, more so within the right infrahilar region, which could represent areas of infection or atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is seen. Old healed right mid clavicular fracture is noted.
