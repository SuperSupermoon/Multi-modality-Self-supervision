Compared to yesterday's chest radiograph the patient is rotated to the right. More prominence of the convexity of the ascending aorta is likely secondary to this rotation. The heart is not enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild atelectasis at the left base is evident. No displaced rib fracture is detected within the limitations of portable chest radiograph. L1 compression fracture is again seen.
