ET tube tip is approximately 7.4 cm above the carinal. Right chest tube is in place. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. NG tube tip is most likely in the stomach. Note is made that the side hole of the NG tube is at the gastroesophageal junction and does that should be advanced at least 5-___ cm Multiple left rib fractures are present. There is substantial amount of subcutaneous air. Lucency projecting over the left lower lung is concerning for left pneumothorax. Substantial amount of subcutaneous air is noted bilaterally. No definitive evidence of right pneumothorax is seen but it is most likely obscured by the subcutaneous air. The amount of mediastinal air is better appreciated on the recent chest CT from ___ When compared to previous study the amount of subcutaneous air in particular on the left has substantially increased and the lucency projecting over the left lung base is new O does potentially might represent progression of pneumothorax.
