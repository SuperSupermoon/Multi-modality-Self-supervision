Right upper and lower opacities are slightly improved since the ___ examination. These, as well as a persistent left retrocardiac opacity, could reflect underlying consolidations. A right IJ catheter and orogastric and endotracheal tubes are unchanged in position. There has been interval removal of the external pacer wire. No pneumothorax is detected. A small left pleural effusion appears new.
