As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal increase in atelectasis at the left lung base and blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially due to a minimal left pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload persists. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
