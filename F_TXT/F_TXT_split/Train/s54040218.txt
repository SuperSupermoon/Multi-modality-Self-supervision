AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to prior study obtained on ___. The NG tube passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach but the side hole is just below the gastroesophageal junction. The right subclavian line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as well as there is no change in large bilateral pleural effusions and substantial mediastinal hematoma due to burst fractures of the mid thoracic vertebral bodies. Bibasal opacities reflect a combination of pulmonary contusion, pneumatoceles with pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen.
