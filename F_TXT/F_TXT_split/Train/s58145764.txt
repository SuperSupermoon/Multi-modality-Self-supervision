As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient assumes a different position. The tracheostomy tube as well as the pigtail catheter in the right pleural space are unchanged. The lung bases have minimally increased in reviewed transparency, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. However, small bilateral pleural effusions are still visible. The known right hilar process is constant. Constant position of the left PICC line.
