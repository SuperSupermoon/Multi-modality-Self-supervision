A single frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Changes from prior left thoracotomy are similar in appearance to prior studies. Healed right-sided rib deformities are also noted. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted. Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus may be due to tiny pleural fluid or pleural thickening given the prior pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
