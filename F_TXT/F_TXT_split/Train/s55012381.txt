Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities are seen, most confluent at the right lung base. Findings are likely combination of known underlying metastases although superimposed effusion and/or consolidation are entirely possible. Left chest wall port is seen with catheter tip projecting over the mid SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unremarkable. No acute osseous abnormalities. Surgical clips project over the right breast.
