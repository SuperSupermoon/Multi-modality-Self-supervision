Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. No lung opacities of concern. Top normal heart size. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Moderate atherosclerotic calcification in aortic arch is present. A skinfold in the right upper lateral lung should not be confused for pneumothorax. Focal dense calcification in the left lateral aspect of upper neck is probably within the carotid artery.
