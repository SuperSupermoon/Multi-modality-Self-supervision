Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump is 2 cm from the apex of the aortic knob, variation probably due to changes in patient position. Severe cardiomegaly stable. Loculated right pleural abnormality largely in the upper hemi thorax is also unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is more engorged today than yesterday, but I do not see pulmonary edema. Extent of left lower lobe atelectasis is obscured by the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
