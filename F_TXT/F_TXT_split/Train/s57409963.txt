Since ___ following removal of the right pigtail pleural drainage catheter the moderate to large right pleural effusion has recurred. There is also contour in the right hemi thorax that could be the outline of the right lung. I am not sure whether this is pneumothorax or an unusual skin folds, possibly with a garment clot in the fold mimicking a pleural line. A carefully positioned upright view is recommended, using conventional radiographic technique if clinically feasible.
