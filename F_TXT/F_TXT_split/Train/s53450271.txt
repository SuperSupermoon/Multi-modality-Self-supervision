In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is increased opacification at the right base. This most likely reflects a combination of atelectasis and effusion, though in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Left lung is essentially clear with minimal atelectatic changes at the base. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 6.2 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends into the stomach, though the side hole is at the level of the esophagogastric junction.
