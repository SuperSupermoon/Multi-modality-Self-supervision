Widespread subcutaneous emphysema has minimally decreased in extent in the interval, but pneumomediastinum has apparently increased. The presence of subcutaneous emphysema reduces sensitivity for detecting pneumothoraces, and no large pneumothoraces are evident within this limitation. Widespread pulmonary opacities have slightly progressed in the interval. Small bilateral pleural effusions are again demonstrated.
