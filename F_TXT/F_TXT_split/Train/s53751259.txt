A right chest tube projecting over the right midlung is associated with subcutaneous emphysema. Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis. Allowing for this, there is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and mild to moderate pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, including mild to moderate cardiomegaly, is unchanged.
