1. No interval change in appearance of the chest, with near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax, most likely reflecting lobar collapse with minimal aeration at the left apex with reaccumulation of left pleural effusion or hemorrhage or lung collapse due to mucus plugging. Clinical correlation is advised. Right lung remains clear. There has been a median sternotomy for CABG, although cardiac and mediastinal contours cannot be assessed given that they are obscured by the left opacity. The right internal jugular central line, left subclavian PICC line, left basilar pigtail pleural catheter, and endotracheal tube are unchanged in position. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
