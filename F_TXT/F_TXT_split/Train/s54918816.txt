The endotracheal tube and enteric tube are in standard position. Left internal jugular central line projects over the upper right atrium, and appears to have been advanced, however the apparent position could be secondary to lower inspiratory level. Lung volumes are low and there is persistent left lower lobe collapse. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Upper lung parenchymal opacities are more readily recognized than in the lower lobes. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
