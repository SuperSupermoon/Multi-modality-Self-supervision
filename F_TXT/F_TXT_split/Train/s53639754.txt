Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. A left-sided pacer device is grossly stable in position. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. The mediastinal contours are stable. There is hazy right basilar opacity, likely combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Left lung is clear aside from the region obscured by the left pacer battery pack. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
