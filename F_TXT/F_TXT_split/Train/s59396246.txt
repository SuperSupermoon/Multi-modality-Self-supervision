Single AP view portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient appears somewhat kyphotic in position. There are bibasilar opacities which are likely due to atelectasis or even aspiration. No large pleural effusion is seen. Left base retrocardiac opacity most likely represents atelectasis as seen on preceding CT. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
