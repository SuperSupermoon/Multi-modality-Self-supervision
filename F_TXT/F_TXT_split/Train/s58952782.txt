Single AP semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained. Bibasilar opacities are seen, right greater than left, nonspecific but could be due to underlying infection, atelectasis, or aspiration. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is obscuration of the left costophrenic angle and a small pleural effusion is not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. No overt pulmonary edema.
