The patient has an endotracheal tube with the tip projecting approximately 6 cm above the carina. The tip of the tube is difficult to visualize as it overlays with the nasogastric tube. The nasogastric tube shows a normal course and the tip is located in the stomach. The lung volumes are low. Extensive bilateral mid and lower lobe parenchymal opacities and consolidation, likely associated to small pleural effusions. Moderate cardiomegaly, no overt pulmonary edema.
