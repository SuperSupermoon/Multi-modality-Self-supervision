The exam is technically limited. The lung volumes are very low. There is mild obscuration of the bilateral hemidiaphragms, which could be due to atelectasis, although a developing consolidation cannot be excluded. There is mild lucency overlying the upper hemidiaphragms. There is no overt pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are normal. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aortic arch. The heart size is difficult to evaluate given the low lung volumes, although may be mildly enlarged.
