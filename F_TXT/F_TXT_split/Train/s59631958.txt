12 mm, nodular opacity in the medial aspect of right lower lung overlying the posterior end of 8th rib is concerning for lung nodule, however could be within the rib. To differentiate between lung nodule vs rib lesion, I recommend shallow oblique views for further evaluation. Mild atelectasis is present in the left lung base. Few tiny, well-defined, nodular opacities in the right upper lung are likely calcified granulomas. There are no lung opacities concerning for pneumonia. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
