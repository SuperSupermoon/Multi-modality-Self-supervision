As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased, causing areas of atelectasis in the perihilar and basal lung regions bilaterally. These changes are not substantially progressive as compared to the previous examination. The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position, with the tip of the PICC line projecting over the right atrium. No pneumothorax. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema.
