Compared with the radiograph of 1 hr prior, pulmonary edema has worsened, although the heart size is slightly smaller. This is likely due to vascular redistribution after intubation, with an endotracheal tube tip 4.4 cm above the carina. The new NG tube is in the stomach. No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
