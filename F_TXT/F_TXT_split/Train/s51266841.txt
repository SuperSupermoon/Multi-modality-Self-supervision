Endotracheal tube, left internal jugular central line, and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. There is improving aeration in both lungs consistent with resolving but residual pulmonary edema. There is persistent retrocardiac consolidation with associated layering effusion consistent with partial left lower lobe atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi erect positioning. Stable cardiac enlargement.
