Single frontal view of the chest. The heart size is top normal, exaggerated by low lung volumes. The aortic knob is calcified. Pulmonary vascular markings are indistinct, compatible with mild pulmonary edema. No substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Streaky linear retrocardiac left base opacity most likely represents atelectasis/scarring rather than consolidation.
