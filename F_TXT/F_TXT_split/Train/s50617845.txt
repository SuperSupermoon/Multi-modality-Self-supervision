Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 1 cm from the carina. This needs to be pulled back 2 to 3 cm for more optimal placement and was mentioned on the prior study as well, pointing toward the right mainstem bronchus. There is a right-sided central line with distal lead tip at the distal SVC. There is coarsening of the bronchovascular markings without focal consolidation. The visualized lung fields are grossly clear. There is a nasogastric tube whose tip is below the GE junction.
