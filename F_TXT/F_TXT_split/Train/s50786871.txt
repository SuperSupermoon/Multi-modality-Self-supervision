In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been a thoracentesis with removal of a substantial amount of fluid from the right pleural space. Some residual fluid and atelectasis are seen, but there is no evidence of post procedure pneumothorax. Continued enlargement of cardiac silhouette with indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Central catheter remains in good position.
