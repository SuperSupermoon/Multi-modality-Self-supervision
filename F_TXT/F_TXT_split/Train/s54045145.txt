Stable appearance of cardiomediastinal contours. Bilateral alveolar opacities have slightly improved in the interval. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Note that widened mediastinum could be due to distended vascular structures and/or prominent mediastinal fat, but an infiltrative mediastinal mass cannot be excluded. After the patient has been extubated, standard PA and lateral chest radiographs within the department may be helpful for initial further evaluation of this finding.
