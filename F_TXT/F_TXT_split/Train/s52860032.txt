Since the prior radiograph performed yesterday evening, the patient is now newly intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina. There is worsening opacification of the right lung base, which may be due to aspiration. Additionally there is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with leftward shift of mediastinal structures, suggesting lung collapse. There is no pneumothorax.
