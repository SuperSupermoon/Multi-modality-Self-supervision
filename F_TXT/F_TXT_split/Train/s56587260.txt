In comparison with the study of ___, there is a substantial increase in the hazy opacification in the right hemithorax, consistent with re-accumulation of a substantial amount of pleural fluid. Little apparent change in the degree of effusion on the left. Retrocardiac opacification indicates some volume loss in the left lower lobe. In view of the layering pleural effusions, it is difficult to determine whether there is significant elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
