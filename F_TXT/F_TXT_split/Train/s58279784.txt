The patient is markedly rotated on the current examination which does limit evaluation to some extent. However, no focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia or aspiration. No pleural effusions. No evidence of pulmonary edema. 2-3mm right basilar nodular opacity either represents a vessel on end or a calcified granuloma given its density on plain film imaging. Comparison to remote studies would be helpful. There is some soft tissue opacity in the superior mediastinum, which could reflect prominent vasculature or possibly a thyroid goiter. Clinical correlation is advised, and followup imaging should be based on the clinical assessment. Heart is within normal limits in size given portable technique. There is calcification in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. Surgical clips in the left upper quadrant are seen. No pneumothorax. Thoracolumbar curvature. Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint. No acute bony abnormality.
