1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC, unchanged. There are persistent biapical and bibasilar opacities, with a more consolidative appearance at the right apex. There are associated small layering effusions. Overall, the findings have slightly improved, suggesting a resolving, but persistent mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, although the persistent opacity at the right apex is somewhat concerning for aspiration pneumonia. Continued followup imaging would be advised. Overall, cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
