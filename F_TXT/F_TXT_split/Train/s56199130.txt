The patient has been extubated and a left basal chest drain has been removed. Lung volumes are slightly low with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. No pneumothorax seen. A right-sided internal jugular catheter is in-situ, the tip is in the mid svc. Mild cardiomegaly may in part be due to the projection and in part due to low lung volumes. Similarly widening of the mediastinum may in part be due to the projection. No frank pulmonary edema seen. Interval improvement in the streaky left mid lung opacities, presumed atelectasis. Median sternotomy sutures are unchanged in appearance. Coronary artery bypass clips seen.
