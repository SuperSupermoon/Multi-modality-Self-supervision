CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 7:33 a.m., the inspiratory volumes are slightly lower. Minimal patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is new. Slight increased retrocardiac density is similar to the prior film. Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear, without CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged allowing for technical differences and the mediastinum remains midline. Left-sided indwelling catheter and right IJ sheath tips both overlie the proximal SVC, essentially unchanged. Equivocal slight prominence of the mid abdominal bowel loops. Right upper quadrant cholecystectomy clips noted.
