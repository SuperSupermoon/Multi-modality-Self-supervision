A right pleural drainage pigtail catheter has been placed. The large right pleural effusion has decreased in size, now moderate. The catheter itself is remote from the remaining pleural fluid collection on this upright film, terminating in the medial mid lung. The proximal portion of the catheter takes an unusual course and appears slightly kinked, possibly at the site of entry. There is no pneumothorax. The left lung is clear.
