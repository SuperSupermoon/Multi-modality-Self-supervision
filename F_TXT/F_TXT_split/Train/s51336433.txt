In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 4.8 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends into the upper stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the image. The area of increased opacification in the lower right lung is less prominent than on the previous study. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at both bases. Little change in the apparent area of increased opacification running essentially horizontally in the right mid zone. In the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia would have to be considered.
