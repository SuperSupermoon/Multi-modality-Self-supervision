In comparison with study of ___, the right apical pneumothorax appears larger, though some of this may be due to differences in position. The alignment of the sternal wires also appears somewhat different with the second wire more to the left than on the previous study. Again, differences in positioning could account for this change. Extensive opacification in the retrocardiac region is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable pleural effusion.
