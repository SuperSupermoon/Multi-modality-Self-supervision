Support devices including ET tube, enteric tube and right subclavian central venous line have been removed. Lung volumes are low and the view is somewhat lordotic. However, there is a new airspace opacity projecting over the right heart border, and increased retrocardiac opacification, which may be due to aspiration or infection. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Nodular opacity projecting over the left sixth interspace likely represents a nipple shadow. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits despite the projection.
