Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump is at the apex of the aorta, 4 cm above standard position, as noted on recent radiographic reports and discussed with clinical service more than once. Moderate right pleural effusion is larger, severe left lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion are unchanged. There is probably no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements, nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view, and transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in their respective positions, continuous from the left pectoral generator.
