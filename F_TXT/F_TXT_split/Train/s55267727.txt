In comparison with the study of ___, the bilateral pigtail catheters remain in place. The pleural effusion on the right, some of which could be loculated, is more prominent than on the previous study. The left pleural effusion appears stable and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size or slightly enlarged with little change in the degree of pulmonary edema. In view of the extensive opacifications in the lungs, it would be extremely difficult to exclude the possibility of superimposed pneumonia.
