The lung volumes are low. There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting presence of a small right pleural effusion. There also is minimal volume loss in the middle lobe. At the left lung bases, a discoid atelectasis is seen. Mild cardiomegaly at relatively lower lung volumes. No pulmonary edema. No pneumonia.
