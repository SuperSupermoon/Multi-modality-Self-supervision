A left-sided pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle is in appropriate position. The patient is status post median sternotomy. Increased interstitial markings as well as cephalization of the vessels is consistent with mild pulmonary edema. The amount of edema seems to be somewhat asymmetric, right greater than left. There may also be a small right pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pneumonia. Heart size is mildly enlarged.
