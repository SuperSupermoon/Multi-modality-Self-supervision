Comparison is made to the prior study performed 7 hours earlier. There has been some retraction of the endotracheal tube which is now 5.4 cm above the carina. There are bilateral central venous lines with distal lead tips in the mid to distal SVC. There has been worsening of the airspace opacities throughout both lung fields which may be due to ARDS with superimposed pulmonary edema. There is a left retrocardiac opacity. No pneumothoraces are seen.
