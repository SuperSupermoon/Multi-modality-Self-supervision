AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. During the latest examination interval, the patient has been extubated and the Swan-Ganz catheter has been withdrawn. The same holds for the NG tube, but the previously described bilateral chest tubes advanced from below remain in position. Poor inspiration explains crowded appearance of pulmonary vasculature but no new infiltrates are seen and no pneumothorax is identified.
