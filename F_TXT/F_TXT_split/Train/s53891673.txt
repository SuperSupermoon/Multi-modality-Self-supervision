Left PICC terminates in the upper SVC. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Patchy nonspecific opacities are present in the right upper and bilateral lower lobes. Right upper lung opacity appears improved since prior exams, likely residua of prior infection. Bilateral lower lobe opacities are nonspecific and may represent either atelectasis or aspiration. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
