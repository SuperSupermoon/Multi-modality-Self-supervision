Compared to the prior examination, there is new opacification of the left lower lobe, which likely represents atelectasis, however an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is a probable small left pleural effusion. The lungs are otherwise clear. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is stable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette with significant tortuosity of the descending aorta. No pneumothorax is visualized.
