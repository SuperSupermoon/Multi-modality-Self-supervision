Again seen is an ET tube which has been advanced slightly and is now in satisfactory position approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. Also again seen is an NG tube with tip beneath diaphragm, overlying gastric fundus. If a sideport is present, it lies above the GE junction. A left subclavian central line with tip over distal SVC. Right upper quadrant surgical clips are noted. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, not significantly enlarged. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, likely accentuated by supine positioning. No focal consolidation and no effusion is identified. Patchy opacity at the lung bases is similar or slightly improved.
