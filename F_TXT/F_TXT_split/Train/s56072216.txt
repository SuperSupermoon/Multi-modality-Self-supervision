In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial clearing of the left mid and lower lung opacification, with only a small residual most likely reflecting atelectasis. Blunting of the costophrenic angle is again seen. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no definite pulmonary edema. The right lung is essentially clear. Left subclavian PICC line remains in place.
