The patient is intubated. An endotracheal tube terminates about 8 cm above the carina. The portion with the balloon is not well visualized, lying superior to the films. A dialysis catheter terminates in the uppermost right atrium. A right-sided PICC line is been removed. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including marked enlargement of the main pulmonary artery contour. Incidental note is made of an azygos fissure, a common normal variant. There is mild opacification in the retrocardiac area but markedly decreased. Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear. Small pleural effusions are likely but also markedly decreased.
