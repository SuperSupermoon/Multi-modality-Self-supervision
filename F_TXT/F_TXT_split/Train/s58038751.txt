AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs, but in conjunction with chest CT yesterday. Lungs are fully expanded and clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal. Multiple rib fractures on both sides of the chest are chronic and healed. These are better assessed on the recent chest CT.
