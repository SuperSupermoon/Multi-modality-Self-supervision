Comparison is made with prior study ___. Increasing opacities in the right perihilar region are worrisome for aspiration/pneumonia. Bibasilar opacities have increased also on the right, consistent with increasing atelectasis and moderate pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC. Cardiac size is obscured by the lung abnormalities.
