Moderate left pneumothorax which developed following evacuation of left pleural effusion with the insertion of a left pleural drain earlier today has increased in size, now moderate. There is no appreciable residual left pleural effusion although there is pleural thickening. Pleural restriction may explain failure of the left lung fully re-expand. Mediastinum is now midline. Atelectasis at the right lung base is mild. A small right pleural effusion could be present. Heart size is probably normal. Right supraclavicular central venous infusion catheter ends low in the right atrium, as before. No right pneumothorax.
