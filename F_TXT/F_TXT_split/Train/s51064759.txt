1. Stable enlarged cardiac and mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy. There continue to be massively enlarged pulmonary arteries consistent with known underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. There are likely small bilateral effusions. However, the pulmonary vascular congestion has improved. There is still patchy opacity at the left base which may represent atelectasis given some interval improvement. No pneumothorax.
