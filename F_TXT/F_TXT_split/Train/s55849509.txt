Compared to the previous radiograph, after hemodialysis, the lung volumes have increased and the extent and severity of the pre-existing opacities have minimally decreased. However, relatively extensive right-sided and left perihilar opacities are seen. The fact that these did not so far respond to hemodialysis could be an indication for their infectious nature. Minimal right pleural effusion persists. Persistent moderate cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax.
