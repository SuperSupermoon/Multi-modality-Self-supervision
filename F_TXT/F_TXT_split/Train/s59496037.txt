There has been interval placement of an ET tube terminating at the thoracic inlet, approximately 8 cm above the carina, which should be advanced for more stable seating. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. There is diffuse reticular nodular opacification of the left lung with slightly improved aeration of the lower lung from the most recent prior study. The right upper lung is well aerated. There is heterogeneous opacification at the right lung base and obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm consistent with consolidation, unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears enlarged. A dual chamber right supraclavicular approach dialysis catheter is unchanged, ending at the cavoatrial junction.
