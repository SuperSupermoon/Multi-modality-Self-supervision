Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Diffuse severe bronchiectasis, most pronounced within the upper lobes, with architectural distortion is compatible with the patient's known history of cystic fibrosis. There is persistent collapse and consolidation of the right upper lobe and lingula, findings which appear relatively unchanged compared to the previous exams. Slight rightward shift of the trachea likely reflects volume loss in the right lung. No pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated. Patchy opacities within the right lung base and left mid lung field appear slightly worse in the interval. There is a possible small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. Remote right-sided rib fracture is noted.
