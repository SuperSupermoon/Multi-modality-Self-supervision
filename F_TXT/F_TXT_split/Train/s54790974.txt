Compared with 1 day earlier, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted, similar to prior. Prominence of the right hilum and surrounding perihilar region appears slightly more pronounced. This is not fully characterized, but the differential diagnosis includes a pneumonic infiltrate. There is new subtle hazy opacity at the right lung base, question due to the increased atelectasis. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora equivocally increased. No gross effusion. Small effusions seen posteriorly on the lateral view from the prior study would likely not be well demonstrated on this AP examination. No pneumothorax detected.
