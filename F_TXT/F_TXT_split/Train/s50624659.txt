Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the patient in upright position. Lung volumes remain low. There is persistent bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema. In addition, there is now an increased focal opacity in the left mid and lower lung fields. Bilateral small pleural effusions are stable. The heart size is difficult to assess due to parenchymal abnormalities. There is no pneumothorax.
