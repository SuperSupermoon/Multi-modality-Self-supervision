The lung volumes are low with mild bibasilar atelectasis. The heart contour is slightly exaggerated by the low lung volumes but is still mildly enlarged. There is also venous congestion with a prominent azygous vein and redistribution of the pulmonary vessels which is compatible with a mild volume overload without evidence of pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
