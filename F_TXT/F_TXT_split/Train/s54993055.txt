As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left-sided PICC line. The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the confluence of the superior vena cava and brachiocephalic vein. To ensure safe position in the mid SVC, the device should be advanced by approximately 2 cm. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.
