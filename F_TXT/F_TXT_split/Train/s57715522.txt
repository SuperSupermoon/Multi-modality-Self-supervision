In comparison with the study ___, there is little overall change in the diffuse bilateral areas of opacification consistent with the clinical diagnosis of multifocal pneumonia. The medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm is not seen, suggesting some volume loss in the left lower lobe. Some of the generalized opacification could well represent some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure as well as bilateral pleural effusions.
