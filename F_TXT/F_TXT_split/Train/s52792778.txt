New heterogeneous opacification in the left lower lung could be due to atelectasis or small amount of pulmonary hemorrhage. The left hilar mass and contiguous tubular left upper lobe mass are unchanged. Pulmonary fibrosis is predominantly basilar. No acute abnormality in the right lung. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Stable moderate enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, largely due to adenopathy and pericardial effusion, respectively.
