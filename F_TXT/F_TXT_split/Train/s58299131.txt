In comparison with the study of ___, there has been a dramatic increase in the right pleural effusion with only aeration of the uppermost portion of the upper lobe. In the absence of displacement of the mediastinal structures, there is compensatory collapse of the right lung. Smaller pleural effusion is seen on the left with compressive basilar atelectasis. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
