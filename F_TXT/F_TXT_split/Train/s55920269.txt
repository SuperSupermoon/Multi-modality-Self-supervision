ET tube ends 5.6 cm above carina. Feeding tube and NG tube are probably in the stomach : the distal end is not included in this study. Bilateral jugular lines are in upper SVC. Left lung widespread opacity compatible with pneumonia is unchanged. Right lung ground-glass opacity with pulmonary vessel enlargement is probably compatible with moderate pulmonary edema that has increased since prior exam. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are top normal and unchanged. Pleural effusion is small if any on the left side.
