A larger pigtail catheter has been introduced into the left lower hemithorax since the prior examination with removal of a previous lower caliber tube. Otherwise, the appearance is fairly similar, including a large loculated left-sided pleural effusion with parenchymal opacities that may be due primarily to associated atelectasis. On this examination, the pulmonary interstitium appears somewhat more prominent than before, suggesting mild fluid overload.
