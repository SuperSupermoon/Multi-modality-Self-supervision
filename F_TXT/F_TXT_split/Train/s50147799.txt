The patient is rotated to the right significantly limiting evaluation of the mediastinal structures. Allowing for these limitations a faint small focal opacity in the left upper lobe is not appreciably changed since ___ and may correspond to scarring. Bibasilar hazy opacities are likely due to atelectasis, however small pleural effusions cannot be excluded on this limited frontal radiograph, and there is mild blunting of the lateral costophrenic sulci. The mediastinal structures are not well evaluated, however, the heart appears mildly enlarged. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
