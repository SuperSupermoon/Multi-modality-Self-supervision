In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with intact midline sternal wires after previous CABG procedure. There is again evidence of pulmonary edema, though possibly slightly less than on the previous study. Hazy opacification, especially on the left is consistent with layering effusion. Right chest tube remains in place and there is no pneumothorax.
