As compared to the previous radiograph, the pneumonia at the level of the left lower lobe has not substantially changed. Also unchanged are the other rather subtle but multifocal parenchymal opacities. The left hilus continues to be slightly enlarged. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged monitoring and support devices. No pneumothorax.
