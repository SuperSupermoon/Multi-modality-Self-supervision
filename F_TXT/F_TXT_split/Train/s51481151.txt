AP upright portable chest radiograph was provided. Midline sternotomy wires are noted. A chest tube at the left lung base is again noted. A left upper extremity access PICC line is seen with its tip in the region of the SVC, though tip is poorly visualized due to slight patient rotation. Tracheostomy tube projects over the mediastinum. Retrocardiac opacity at the left lung base is compatible with effusion and consolidation. There is a small right pleural effusion also noted with probable mild compressive right lower lobe atelectasis. Mild edema is also likely present with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The heart size cannot be assessed. No large pneumothorax is seen. Bony structures appear intact.
