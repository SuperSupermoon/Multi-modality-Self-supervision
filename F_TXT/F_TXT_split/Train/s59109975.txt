In comparison with study of ___, there is continued diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacification, consistent with substantial pleural effusions and compressive basilar atelectasis with moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Opacification in the retrocardiac region is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. Monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
