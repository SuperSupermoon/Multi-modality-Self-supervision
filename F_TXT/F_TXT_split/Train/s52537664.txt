The lungs are well inflated. There is no change in bibasilar effusions, greater on the left. A tiny right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. There is no new consolidation. A left-sided internal jugular catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. An aortic valve stent is in unchanged position. A star-like radio-opaque structure may be outside the patient, as its position changes in relation to the aortic stent.
