Compared to the prior examination, there has been increase in size of right-sided pleural effusion as well as worsening of right base consolidation with mild rightward mediastinal shift. The right main stem bronchus is difficult to visualize distally and may be plugged with mucus. A previously described right apical pneumatocele is more fluid filled compared to prior study. Post-radiation changes in the right lung are unchanged. Pulmonary edema in the left lung is improved. A small left-sided pleural effusion is unchanged. A left-sided port remains in unchanged position with the tip at the cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax.
