As compared to previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The extent of the bilateral pleural effusions is constant. There is rather extensive reactive atelectasis at the lung bases. No newly occurred parenchymal opacities. The moderate cardiomegaly persists and the lung volumes remain overall low. The nasogastric tube shows an unchanged course. The left subclavian vein catheter, with its tip projecting over the right atrium, is also unchanged.
