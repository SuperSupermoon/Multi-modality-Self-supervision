As compared to a previous study of 1 day earlier, Swan-Ganz catheter continues to terminate in the interlobar portion of the right pulmonary artery and may be withdrawn slightly for standard positioning. Other support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. Widespread pulmonary opacities have substantially improved. No definite free intraperitoneal air is identified, but left lateral decubitus abdominal radiograph would be more sensitive than a supine chest radiograph for detecting this finding and may be helpful for more complete consideration given the provided clinical suspicion for free air.
