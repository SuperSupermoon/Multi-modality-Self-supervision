Assessment is limited by patient positioning and rotation. The patient's chin and neck obscures assessment of the right apex limiting the assessment for pneumothorax. No pneumothorax is grossly identified. Left basilar chest tube has been removed. Tracheostomy tube remains in unchanged position. Heart size appears mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous but unchanged. Fiducial seed is again demonstrated in a known right lower lung mass with continued right lower lobe atelectasis. Small to moderate size right pleural effusion is re- demonstrated. Worsening asymmetric increased interstitial markings on the right are noted as well as new focal consolidative opacity within the right lower lobe adjacent to the minor fissure. Small left pleural effusion is noted. Left lung is hyperinflated.
