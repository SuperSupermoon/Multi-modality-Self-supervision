In comparison with the study of ___, there are improved lung volumes. The nodular opacification projected over the upper right lung is no longer seen, suggesting that this represented an artifact. Otherwise, there is little change except for some increasing opacification at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic angle. This most likely reflects volume loss in the left lower lobe and possible small effusion. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
