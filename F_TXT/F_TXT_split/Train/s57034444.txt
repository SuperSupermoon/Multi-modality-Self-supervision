Moderate right apical pneumothorax and extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall appear similar, but there has been improvement in the extent of subcutaneous emphysema in the left supraclavicular and cervical regions. The patient is status post right upper lobe sleeve lobectomy. Homogeneous opacity in the region of the right hilar and suprahilar region has partially cleared and may reflect improving right middle lobe atelectasis. Left lung is clear, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in the post-operative period.
