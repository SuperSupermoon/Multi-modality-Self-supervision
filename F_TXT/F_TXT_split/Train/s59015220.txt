Right internal jugular dialysis catheter is present with tip terminating in the region of the cavoatrial junction. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Upper zone vascular redistribution is present, but there is no evidence of interstitial or alveolar edema. Multifocal linear atelectasis is present in the left mid and both lower lungs as well as a more confluent patchy opacity in both retrocardiac regions, which likely represents atelectasis. Aspiration and infectious pneumonia can have a similar radiographic appearance however.
