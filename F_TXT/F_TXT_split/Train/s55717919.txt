The lungs are hyperinflated with relative lucency at the bilateral lung apices suggestive of COPD/emphysema. There has been interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions from ___. Streaky opacities in the bilateral bases most likely reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is detected. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged from the prior study.
