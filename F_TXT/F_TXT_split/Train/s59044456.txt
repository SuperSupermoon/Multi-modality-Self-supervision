A pacemaker generator overlies the left chest wall. Right atrial and biventricular leads appear in expected position. Temporary epicardial pacing leads project over the left ventricle. There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating in the upper SVC. Lung volumes are low, and there is increased opacification of the left lung base, suggesting worsening atelectasis and pleural effusion. Opacities in the right lung base appears stable and likely reflect atelectasis. There is no post-procedure pneumothorax.
