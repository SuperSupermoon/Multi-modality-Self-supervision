There has been interval removal of the endotracheal and endogastric tubes. The right IJ central venous line tip still sits at the cavoatrial junction. Chest drains are unchanged. The heart and mediastinal contours are unchanged given the slightly lower lung volumes. There may be trace left pleural effusion but no large pneumothorax. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis is present.
