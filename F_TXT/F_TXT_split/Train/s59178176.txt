As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been repositioned. The tip of the tube now projects 5.4 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is coiled in the esophagus and needs to be repositioned. The stomach is still overinflated. The pre-existing opacities in the right lung have decreased in extent. On the later radiograph from 9:29, the feeding tube is correctly positioned.
