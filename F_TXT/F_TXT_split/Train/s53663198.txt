The study is limited due to rotation and low lung volumes. The heart is moderate to severely enlarged. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour is seen similar compared to the prior study and attributable to mediastinal fat as seen on the prior chest CTA from ___. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, and mild pulmonary edema is likely present. Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis. Infection cannot be excluded. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Degenerative changes of both glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints are noted.
