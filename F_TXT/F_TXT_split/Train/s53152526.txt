AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with a similar preceding study obtained three hours earlier during the same day. During the latest interval, a right-sided pigtail-end drainage catheter has been introduced through the lower lateral chest wall remaining with its pigtail tip end in the lateral lower portion of the right pleural sinus. The drainage was very effective as the pleural effusion on the right base has been practically eliminated totally making the contour of the right diaphragm well visible. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area of the right hemithorax. Previously described tracheal cannula remains in unchanged appropriate position. The pulmonary vascular pattern has not been altered. The left-sided basal pleural density which appeared similar with the previous appearance of the right side remains unchanged.
