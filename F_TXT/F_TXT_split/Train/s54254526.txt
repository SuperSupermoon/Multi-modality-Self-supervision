AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Lung volumes are lower, moderate right pleural effusion larger, and mediastinal veins more engorged suggesting volume overload. Subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall and pneumomediastinum have not changed appreciably. I don't see a pneumothorax. Atelectasis at the left lung base has worsened. Drainage catheter projecting over the left upper abdominal quadrant cannot be localized on single frontal view. Once again the colon, as seen in the limited view of the upper abdomen, is moderately to severely distended and edematous.
