Lung volumes are low. Bronchovascular markings are prominent. There is no focal consolidation. There is streaky density at the lung bases likely representing subsegmental atelectasis. The right pulmonary hilum remains prominent. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Mediastinal structures are otherwise unremarkable. The bony thorax is grossly intact. Allowing for differences in technique, there is no significant change.
