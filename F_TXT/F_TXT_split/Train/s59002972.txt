Single supine view of the chest. There is increased hazy opacity projecting over the right lung compatible with layering effusion and atelectasis. Multiple right-sided rib fractures are better seen on subsequent CT. The left lung is grossly clear but partially obscured by overlying trauma board and hardware. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
