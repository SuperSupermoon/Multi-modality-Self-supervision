Frontal view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina. OG tube terminates within the stomach. Right PICC terminates in the mid SVC. Bibasilar hazy opacities are compatible with bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Interval increase in right pleural effusion and stable left pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacities are compatible with atelectasis. Indistinct pulmonary vasculature is compatible with mild-to-moderate edema. No pneumothorax. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are similar to prior.
