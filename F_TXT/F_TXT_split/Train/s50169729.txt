The cardiomediastinal contours are stable, reflective of a tortuous thoracic aorta. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. There is pulmonary vascular congestion and at least moderate pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Projecting of the left upper abdomen are vascular coils likely within the splenic artery.
