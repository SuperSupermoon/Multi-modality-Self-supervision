As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The tip of the tube projects over the proximal parts of the stomach. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette, the bilateral pleural effusions and the basal areas of atelectasis are unchanged. Slightly more obvious is mild fluid overload.
