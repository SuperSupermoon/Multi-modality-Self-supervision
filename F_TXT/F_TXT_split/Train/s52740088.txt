Comparison is made with prior study from ___. There is a right-sided AICD with the distal lead tips in the right atrium and right ventricle. There is a left-sided vascular catheter with distal lead tip at the distal SVC and proximal right atrium. There is also a right IJ central line with the distal lead tip at the distal SVC. Heart size is within normal limits. There is prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. There are no pneumothoraces identified.
