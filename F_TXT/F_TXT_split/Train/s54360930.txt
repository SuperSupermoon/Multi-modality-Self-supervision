AP chest compared to ___: Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium and should be withdrawn 1 cm to place it in the low SVC. ET tube is in standard placement. Esophageal temperature probe probably ends in the low esophagus and an upper enteric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. There is no pneumothorax. Small pleural effusions may be present, not appreciably changed. Previous asymmetric pulmonary consolidation, severe in the left lung has improved since ___, but now there is greater bibasilar consolidation, essentially stable since ___, and pulmonary vascular congestion is also unchanged. It is hard to say whether there is mild pulmonary edema. The heart is mildly to moderately enlarged, and the basal lung findings could be either atelectasis, dependent edema, or even pneumonia, in combination. If greater specificity is required from the imaging studies, then CT scanning should be requested.
