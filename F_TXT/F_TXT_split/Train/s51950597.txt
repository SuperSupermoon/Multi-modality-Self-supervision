Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Right lower lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis has worsened. Left lower lobe opacities are stable, a combination of pneumonia and pleural effusion. There are low lung volumes. Cardiomegaly is stable. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC.
