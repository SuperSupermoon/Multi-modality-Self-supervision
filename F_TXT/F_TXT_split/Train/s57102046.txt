As compared to the recent radiograph of earlier today, an orogastric has been placed, with tip visualized at least to the level of the proximal stomach. However, the side port could potentially be above the GE junction level. Given the difficulty in visualizing the tube tip and side poor, additional radiograph optimized to visualize the orogastric tube may be helpful.
