Tracheostomy tube remains in place. A feeding tube passes into the stomach and off the inferior margin of the film. In addition, a catheter passing over the right upper quadrant is of unclear etiology. There is a left IJ approach central line, extending to the upper SVC. The lung volumes remain low, with bilateral pleural effusions causing opacities of the lower lung fields. There is associated basilar atelectasis. Pulmonary vascular congestion and edema is worsened from one day prior. There is no new focal opacity to suggest pneumonia, though one could easily be obscured in the lower lung zones. There is no pneumothorax.
