Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, right internal jugular catheter and left internal jugular central line are unchanged position. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.

Improving aeration at the left base with minimal residual atelectasis. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. No large effusions.
