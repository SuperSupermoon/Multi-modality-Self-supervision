Large right pleural effusion roughly unchanged since ___, obscures much of the right lower lung but probably produces severe atelectasis in the middle and lower lobes. Left lower lobe is progressively more consolidated, either atelectasis or pneumonia. Mild pulmonary edema in the left lung may be due to redirection of blood flow from the hypoxic right hemithorax. Heart size is indeterminate. Progressive coronal narrowing of the trachea, usually an indication of COPD, is more likely a manifestation of increased trans pleural pressure in the right chest and perhaps mild tracheomalacia.
