Small bilateral pneumothoraces are similar to the prior study, with bilateral chest tubes remaining in place. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Left perihilar and basilar opacification are new, and could potentially represent an acute aspiration event and less likely asymmetrical pulmonary edema. Right lung is hyperexpanded but grossly clear except for a few scattered calcified granulomas. Unchanged widening of mediastinum in keeping with a history of aortic pseudoaneurysm, with aortic stent graft in place within the region of the ascending aorta. Interval removal of malpositioned left PICC since the prior radiograph.
