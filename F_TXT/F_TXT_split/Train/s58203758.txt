A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The lungs are well expanded without dense consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Subtle opacity at the right lung base is likely crowding of vessels but may represent infection in the appropriate clinical setting. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. No acute osseous abnormality is identified. A left pectoral intracardiac device tip projects over the right ventricle. An LAD stent is in place. A 10mm nodule over the right lung basemay be nipple.
