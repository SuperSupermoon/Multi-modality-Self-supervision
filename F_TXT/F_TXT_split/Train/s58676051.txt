Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates mild pulmonary vasculature engorgement possibly reflecting an element of mild fluid overload. Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is slight asymmetric increased opacifiction projecting over the left lower hemithorax, not clearly anatomical or intraparenchymal and may be due to overlying soft tissue or technique. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. Increased density projecting below the left hemidiaphragm likely relates to significant splenomegaly evident on ___ CT. No osseous abnormality identified.
