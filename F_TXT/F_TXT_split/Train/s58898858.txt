Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for marked rightward patient rotation, accentuating a tortuous thoracic aorta. Patchy and linear bibasilar atelectasis are present, slightly improved on the right but worse on the left. Remainder of lungs are clear, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
