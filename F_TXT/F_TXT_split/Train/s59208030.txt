AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Severe pulmonary consolidation in the right upper and perihilar left lung improved dramatically between ___ and ___ in a fashion indicating that much of that was due to asymmetric edema. Since ___, lung volumes have decreased and may account for some of the increased opacity in the lower lungs, but I think that pulmonary edema has returned. Hilar and mediastinal vessels are engorged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. Moderate cardiomegaly has worsened. ET tube in standard placement. Right subclavian or PIC line ends in the upper right atrium. Substantial intestinal distension is still present in the upper abdomen. No pneumothorax.
