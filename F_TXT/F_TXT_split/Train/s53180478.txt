AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 5:45 a.m.: Possible small right pleural effusion, collected apically in the supine patient. No definite pneumothorax. Right apical pleural drain in place. Angulation of the trachea is exaggerated in this position. ET tube ends at the thoracic inlet. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Left lung clear. Mediastinal widening is longstanding, more likely due to fat deposition and dilated tortuous vessels than mass, but really not diagnosable by conventional radiographs. Heart size is at least moderately enlarged.
