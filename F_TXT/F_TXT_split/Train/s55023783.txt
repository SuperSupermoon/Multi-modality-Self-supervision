Stable right upper lobe opacification likely representing a combination of tumor infiltration and collapse. New opacifications of the bilateral lung bases, right greater than left, possibly representing lymphangitic spread of tumor versus superimposed infectious process. Left border of the cardiomediastinal and hilar structures is unremarkable. Right border is not well assessed due to opacification.
