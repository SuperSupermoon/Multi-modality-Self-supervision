Diminished lung volumes with diffuse bilateral interstitial reticular opacities correlating with the extensive parenchymal fibrosis seen on recent chest CT dated ___. The fibrotic changes do not appear significantly changed but lower the ability to detect subtle abnormalities on plain radiography. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely not changed but again are difficult to assess due to the diffuse lung process. No large effusions. No pneumothorax.
