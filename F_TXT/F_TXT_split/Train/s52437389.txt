In comparison with study of ___, the postprocedural right apical pneumothorax is essentially unchanged. Extensive areas of perihilar and apical lateral parenchymal opacities are again seen on the right. The left lung knee is essentially clear except for hazy opacification at the base consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Layering pleural effusion is also seen at the right base with atelectatic changes associated.
