Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Small right apical pneumothorax has minimally improved. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged and shifted towards the right as before. Extensive right subcutaneous emphysema has minimally improved. An apical and a basal right chest tubes are in place. Small right pleural effusion has minimally increased. Multifocal peripheral opacities in the right lung are most likely atelectasis, minimally increased from prior. Multiple surgical clips project in the right hemithorax.
