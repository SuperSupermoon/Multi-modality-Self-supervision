In comparison with the study of ___, decreased opacification at the bases. Findings are consistent with residual pneumonia, especially at the right base, possibly with some improvement in pulmonary vascular status. Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Probable bilateral pleural effusions.
