Lung volumes are lower and yet generalized pulmonary opacification has improved, accompanied by decrease in persistent pulmonary vascular and mediastinal venous distension. This represents some improvement in cardiac function of volume overload. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. There is still more severe opacification in the right midlung. Whether this is fissural pleural fluid or focal consolidation due to pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate. Leftward mediastinal shift suggests that left lower lobe consolidation is largely atelectasis. ET tube and midline drain still in place. No pneumothorax.
