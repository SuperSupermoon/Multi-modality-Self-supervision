Endotracheal tube is in standard position with tip terminating approximately 5.6 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach. Right sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right atrium, unchanged. Lung volumes are low. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Linear opacity within the right lung base is worse in the interval compatible with progressive atelectasis. Minimal atelectasis is also noted in the left lung base. There may be a small right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. Several clips are seen projecting over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
