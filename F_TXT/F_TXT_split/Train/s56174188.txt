Lordotic positioning. Low inspiratory volumes, which accentuate the prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette. A right-sided chest tube is present. There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema. Allowing for this, no definite pneumothorax. However, curvilinear lucency at the right base is equivocal for a small basilar pneumothorax. Compared with ___ at 19:53 p.m. and allowing for differences in technique, there appears to have been increased opacification of the right lung as well as some new patchy opacity at the left base. This has also progressed compared with the film dated ___ at 4:01 a.m.
