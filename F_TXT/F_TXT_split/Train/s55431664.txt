Allowing for overlying soft tissues and low inspiratory volumes, heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged, with slight left ventricular configuration. Doubt CHF. Patchy opacity is noted at both bases medially -- this could represent atelectasis, but the differential includes early pneumonic infiltrates or early areas of aspiration. These are very slightly more pronounced than on the prior radiographs. Elsewhere, no focal infiltrates. No gross effusion.
