As compared to the prior study there is slightly different appearance of the right hilus which demonstrates to be less bulky although it might be related to substantial rotation of the patient and the question still remains of the potential lymphadenopathy. In the meantime the patient has been intubated with the ET tube tip being 5 cm above the Carina. Large right pleural effusion and moderate at least left pleural effusion are noted as well as bibasal consolidations and perihilar opacities
