Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates well expanded, clear lungs. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation. Right-sided PICC line ends at the cavoatrial junction. A vague linear opacity projects over the left axilla and is less concerning for retained foreign body on this radiograph.
