Moderate right pleural effusion is new, making it difficult to assess changes in the previous substantial right lower lobe consolidation. Left lower lobe consolidation, less severe than the right is no worse today. Findings suggest bilateral aspiration. Moderate cardiomegaly stable. No pneumothorax. ET tube, left subclavian line, nasogastric drainage tube all in standard placements.
