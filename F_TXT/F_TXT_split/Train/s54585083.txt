Transverse cardiomegaly. Widened superior mediastinum unchanged. Subsegmental atelectatic changes in left lung mid zone as well as bibasal areas. No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. No large effusions. Right-sided IJV CVP in situ with the tip at the cavoatrial junction/ in the proximal right atrium. The sternal wires demonstrate a slight scoliotic alignment with a widened interval between the superior 3 and inferior 3 sternal wires, but this appears stable compared to prior imaging. No new central lucency projecting over the mediastinum. Degenerative changes of the shoulder girdles.
