A tracheostomy tube is in place. A VP shunt catheter is seen passing through the right neck and hemithorax and into the abdomen. The lungs are well expanded and clear. Mild prominence of the right hilum is again noted, likely reflecting vascular dilation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
