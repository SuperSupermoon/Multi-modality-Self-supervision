In comparison with these earlier study of this date, there is little overall change. Large diaphragmatic hernia and extensive pleural effusion on the left are again seen with extremely low lung volumes. Displacement of the mediastinum to the right the is again seen, where there appears to be a smaller pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette cannot be precisely seen due to the previously mentioned abnormalities. Engorgement of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
