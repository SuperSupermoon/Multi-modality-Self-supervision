Right Port-A-Cath tip projects over of the expected region of the proximal right atrium, unchanged. No significant interval change. A small amount of fluid tracks in the minor fissure. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. Left lower lobe opacity likely reflects atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding setting of low lung volumes. Enlarged hilar nodes are again noted.
