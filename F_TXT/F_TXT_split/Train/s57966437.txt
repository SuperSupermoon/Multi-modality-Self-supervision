There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion bilaterally, slightly worse in the lower lung zones. There is mild interstitial edema. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is not significantly changed since prior, allowing for differences in positioning. The lower left heart border is obscured, as on prior. Imaged osseous structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen. Right PICC tip, sternal wires, prosthetic heart valve, and aortic arch calcifications appear similar compared to prior.
