Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. Heart is top normal in size in the setting of low lung volumes. Persistent enlargement of the pulmonary vessels suggests ongoing pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The right internal jugular central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
