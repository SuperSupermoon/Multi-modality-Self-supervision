In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Again there is increased opacification at the left base consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. Prominence of the right hilum persists. The curvilinear opacification extending from the hilum to the periphery is again seen, possibly slightly more prominent.
