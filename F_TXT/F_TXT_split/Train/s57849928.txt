In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed. Continued hyperexpansion of the lungs with hazy opacification at the bases silhouetting the hemidiaphragms and consistent with layering effusions with some compressive atelectasis at the bases. Overall, little change except for tube removal.
