A single portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained. A known right upper lobe mass widens the mediastinum. In addition, a right upper lobe ground-glass opacity is new. Elevation of the right minor fissure indicates volume loss. Linear opacities at both lung bases most likely reflects atelectasis. Rounded opacities at both lung bases are most compatible with nipple shadows. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions, apparent on the subsequent CT, are no well seen on this exam. Moderate cardiomegaly is exaggerated by AP technique but may be bigger compared with the prior exam. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is better seen on CT. Median sternotomy wires and valve prosthesis are intact.
