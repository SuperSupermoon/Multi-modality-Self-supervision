Right-sided PICC terminates in the distal SVC as before. A tracheostomy is in unchanged position. A moderate layering right pleural effusion is demonstrated as well as a small to moderate left layering pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. The heart is enlarged but stable from multiple prior exams. There is no pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is minimally engorged in and there is mild interstitial pulmonary edema, improved from the prior.
