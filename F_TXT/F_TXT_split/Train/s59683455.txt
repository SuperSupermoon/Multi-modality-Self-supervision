1. Orogastric tube is seen which courses below the diaphragm and the tip projects over the expected location of the stomach. Left internal jugular central line with its tip in the proximal SVC. There has been some interval improvement in bilateral airspace process associated with layering effusions. Given the interval change, this would favor resolving pulmonary edema, but superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
