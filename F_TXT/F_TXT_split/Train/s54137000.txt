ET tube and NG tube and right-sided PICC line are unchanged in position. Extensive patchy interstitial alveolar opacities in both lungs, similar to prior film. Possible slightly more confluence in the right mid zone, though this could also be accentuated due to differences in film technique. However, opacity in the right mid zone has definitely progressed compared with ___ at 18:10. There is blunting of both costophrenic angles, consistent with small pleural effusions and/or pleural thickening, not substantially changed. Calcifications are present along both hemidiaphragms. Right upper quadrant surgical clips noted.
