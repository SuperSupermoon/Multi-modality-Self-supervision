As compared to prior chest radiograph from several hr earlier, there has been worsening hemorrhage opacification in the left lung base. It is uncertain whether this might represent localized aspiration or rapidly developing pneumonia, and short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard. No other relevant change.
