Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained. A left chest tube has been removed. There is no appreciable pneumothorax. A right IJ terminates in the low SVC. There are persistent low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis, more pronounced on the left side. Persistent mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Cardiomegaly and postoperative mediastinal widening are stable.
