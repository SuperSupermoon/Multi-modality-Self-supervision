Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. An AICD device is unchanged in position with lead tip extending into the right ventricle region. There is pulmonary vascular congestion with Kerley B lines evident with ground-glass haziness in the lungs compatible with pulmonary edema. There may be tiny pleural effusions. No large pneumothorax is seen. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly within normal limits. Bony structures are intact.
