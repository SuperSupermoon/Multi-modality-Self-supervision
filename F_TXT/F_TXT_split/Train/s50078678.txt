There has been little change there since ___. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema in the mid and upper lungs zones has not changed very much over the past several days. The combination of dependent edema and atelectasis projecting over pleural effusions may explain apparent consolidation in the lower lobes, but I cannot exclude pneumonia. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is stable. No pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax.
