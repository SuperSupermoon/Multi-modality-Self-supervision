No pneumothorax, appreciable pneumomediastinum, or pleural effusion is present. Mediastinum is minimally wider today than it was in ___, probably due to vascular engorgement. Heart is mildly enlarged but there is no pulmonary edema. Consolidation or atelectasis projects over the medial aspect of the right hilus. Chronicity of this finding is indeterminate since no preoperative chest radiograph is available.
