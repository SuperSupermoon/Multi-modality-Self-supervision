AP chest compared to 3:32 a.m.: Small right pneumothorax, largely medial, has not increased. Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved minimally. Heart size has decreased. Opacity at the left lung base could be atelectasis or developing pneumonia. There is no longer any pulmonary edema. Pleural effusion is minimal if any. ET tube in standard placement. Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. If feasible, an upright or left decubitus view should be obtained to exclude the possibility of pneumoperitoneum which was questioned on an upright chest radiograph yesterday. Dr. ___ has been paged to discuss these findings.
