ET tube tip is in the mid thoracic trachea. Enteric tube tip is in the stomach with the side port near the GE junction. Low lung volumes again cause accentuation of the cardiac silhouette as well as bronchovascular crowding. Pulmonary vascular congestion and right basilar atelectasis are mild, similar to prior. Retrocardiac opacity appears minimally worse compared to prior. Pleural effusions are small if any. There is no pneumothorax. Imaged osseous structures are intact.
