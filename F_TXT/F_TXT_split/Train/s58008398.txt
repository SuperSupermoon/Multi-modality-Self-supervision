The left pleural effusion is smaller but persists with a subpulmonic component. Left basilar opacity also remains. There is no pneumothorax or right pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Again seen is a left anterior chest pacemaker defibrillator with tips terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle as expected.
