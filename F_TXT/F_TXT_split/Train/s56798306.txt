Assessment is limited due to patient rotation. Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the right atrium. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable. There is no pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities within the right lung base likely reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Previously noted osseous metastases are seen better visualized on the prior CT.
