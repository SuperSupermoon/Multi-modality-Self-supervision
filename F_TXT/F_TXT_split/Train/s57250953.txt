Support and monitoring devices remain in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Multifocal bilateral areas of heterogeneous consolidation have worsened in the interval, suggestive of a progressive multifocal pneumonia coexisting with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. A rounded lucency in the right upper lobe may reflect a region of spared lung parenchyma, but attention to this region on short-term followup radiograph would be helpful to exclude developing cavitation from necrotizing pneumonia.
