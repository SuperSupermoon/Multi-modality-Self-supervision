The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Focal opacity at the right lung base could reflect normal bronchovascular structures versus atelectasis. Upper lobes are clear. There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles, likely secondary to overlying soft tissues. If possible complete evaluation with frontal and lateral chest radiographs is recommended.
