Diffuse bilateral hazy opacities with perihilar fullness is compatible with moderate pulmonary edema, increased at the lung bases from the prior CT. Opacity at the right lower lobe may be due to edema, but underlying infection cannot be excluded. There is probably a small right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal silhouette is normal. A surgical clip projects over the left upper quadrant.
