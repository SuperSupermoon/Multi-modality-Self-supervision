There is a knee new ET tube which is 2 low, at the right mainstem bronchus. The right IJ line tip is at the distal SVC . There is increased size of the right pleural effusion layering posteriorly and surrounding the right lung. The 2 right-sided chest tubes are again visualized. There is increased opacity about the right lung centrally. It is unclear how much of this is fluid layering posteriorly and a how much is due to volume loss/infiltrate There is a small left effusion. There is volume loss at both bases.
