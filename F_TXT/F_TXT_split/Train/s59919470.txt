Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. Lung volumes are low, but right mid to lower lung airspace opacities may be due to infection or atelectasis. A left basilar retrocardiac airspace opacity may also be due to atelectasis or infection. The patient's chin and overlying soft tissues partially obscure the lung apices. But there is no obvious pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged.
