Since a recent radiograph from several hr earlier, a right basilar pneumothorax is newly appreciated with indwelling chest tube. Interval decrease in width of cardiomediastinal contours likely reflects provided history of evacuation of hematoma. Note is also made of improving bibasilar atelectasis and decreasing pleural effusions. Swan-Ganz catheter has been withdrawn to the level of the main pulmonary artery. No other relevant changes since the recent study.
