Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle is unchanged. The heart is mild to moderately enlarged, with mild pulmonary vascular congestion noted. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta are seen. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis or infection. Small left pleural effusion is relatively similar compared to the prior study, as is a tiny right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
