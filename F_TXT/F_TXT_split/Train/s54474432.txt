The intra-aortic balloon pump has been removed. There is again seen a Swan-Ganz catheter whose distal tip is near the main pulmonary artery trunk. There is a nasogastric tube with sideport above the GE junction and should be advanced several centimeters for more optimal placement. The endotracheal tube is 6.7 cm above the carina, unchanged. Heart size is normal. Lungs are clear. There are no pneumothoraces.
