Compared with the prior study, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed. The right IJ line is again seen, tip -- as before-- near cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax is identified. On the current study, the patient is markedly rotated, much more so than on the prior study. This makes direct comparison to the prior study difficult. There appears to be upper zone redistribution, with diffuse vascular blurring and interstitial edema, consistent with CHF. Patchy opacity at the right base with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm and blunting of the right costophrenic angle is probably similar, allowing for differences in positioning. The left hemidiaphragm remains distinctly visible. The possibility of some retrocardiac opacity at the left base would be difficult to exclude due to positioning. No gross left effusion.
