In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right IJ catheter again extends to the level of the cavoatrial junction. The endotracheal tube has been pulled back so that its tip is about 3.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube extends to the stomach although the side hole is just above the level of the esophagogastric junction. Little change in appearance of the heart and lungs.
