Compared to ___ radiograph, mild cardiomegaly is now accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion, mild interstitial edema, and increasing right pleural effusion, now small to moderate in size. 6.1 cm mass in the periphery of the right upper lobe with adjacent pleural thickening is similar to the recent radiograph but has substantially grown compared to outside chest CT of ___ and is consistent with progressive malignancy. Left lower lobe opacification and adjacent pleural effusion are again demonstrated. Poorly defined nodular opacities in the left upper lobe are partially obscured by acute edema and could be more fully characterized by CT if warranted clinically.
