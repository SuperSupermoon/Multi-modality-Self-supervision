Overall, there is no significant interval change in large left-sided airspace opacification consistent with pneumonia. A relative lucency in the left base likely represents a small amount of aerated lung adjacent to the consolidation. No definite pneumothorax is seen. There may be a small left pleural effusion. The heart size appears within normal limits. An endotracheal tube is in standard position. A right internal jugular central venous catheter tip reaches the upper SVC. An esophageal catheter is in place with tip in the stomach, however, side port likely within the distal esophagus or just at the gastroesophageal junction.
