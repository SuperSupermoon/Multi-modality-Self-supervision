The patient remains intubated with the endotracheal tube terminating at the thoracic inlet. An orogastric tube terminates in the lower esophagus. A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged. What is new, however, is a right internal central jugular venous catheter that terminates in the upper superior vena cava. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is similar opacification of the left lung base obscuring cardiac borders as well as the left hemidiaphragm, suggesting potential combination of consolidation or atelectasis, probably with some degree of pleural effusion. Hazy indistinct bronchovascular structures suggest mild fluid overload, but not increased. There is no pneumothorax.
