Single semi-erect frontal view of the chest demonstrates patient to be moderately rotated to the left, distorting cardiomediastinal silhouette. This likely accounts for apparent mediastinal widening, which is accentuated by semisupine position and AP technique. Lung volumes are low, accentuating bronchovascular crowding. Allowing for such, there is mild perivascular congestion. Streaky bibasilar opacity could represent aspiration, evolving infection, or a component of atelectasis. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax. A tracheostomy is in place. Mild diffuse osseous demineralization is present. Moderate right greater than left glenohumeral osteoarthritis is present.
