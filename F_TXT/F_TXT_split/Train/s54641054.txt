A right-sided Port-A-Cath is present with the tip likely at or just beyond the atriocaval junction. Surgical clips are present in the left apex. The lungs appear slightly hyperinflated, consistent with emphysema. There is no focal airspace consolidation or pulmonary edema. There are post surgical changes in the left hemithorax with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and pleural thickening. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac size is difficult to evaluate given the post surgical changes. The mediastinal contours are normal. Calcifications are noted within the aortic arch and the descending aorta.
