AP chest compared to ___: Right upper lobe pneumonia may have improved slightly since ___. Greater opacification in both lung bases could be explained by atelectasis and increasing moderate bilateral pleural effusions but radiographically, I cannot exclude other foci of pneumonia. Left upper lobe shows vascular congestion but no pulmonary edema. The heart is normal size. ET tube is in standard placement. Transvenous right atrial and ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective standard positions and upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
