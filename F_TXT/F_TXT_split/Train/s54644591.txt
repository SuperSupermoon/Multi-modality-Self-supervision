Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates stable massive bilateral widespread parenchymal opacities. There is a new small right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The endotracheal tube ends 3.7 cm from the carina. The right-sided subclavian central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of field of view.
