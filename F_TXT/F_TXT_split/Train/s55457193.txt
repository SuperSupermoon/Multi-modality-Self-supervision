The only appreciable change in the appearance of the lungs over the past several days, when a chest CT showed severe bronchiectasis primarily in the lower lobes and scattered ground-glass opacities elsewhere, has been an increase in retained secretions in the dilated right lower lobe bronchi. There are no findings to suggest new pneumonia or pleural effusion. Heart size is normal.
