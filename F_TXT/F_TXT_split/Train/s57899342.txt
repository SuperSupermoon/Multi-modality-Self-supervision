Single semi-upright AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity could be due to atelectasis or infection. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle is felt to most likely be due to overlying soft tissue. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. The aorta is tortuous.
