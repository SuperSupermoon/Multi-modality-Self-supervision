A dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium, as before. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is no overt evidence for fluid overload. There may be perhaps a vague opacity in the right lower lung that appears similar and may represent minimal chronic scarring or atelectasis. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Degenerative changes including fragmentation of the humeral head on the right appears similar.
