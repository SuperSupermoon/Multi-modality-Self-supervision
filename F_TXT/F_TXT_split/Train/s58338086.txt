In comparison with the study of ___, pigtail catheter is again seen at the right base. The degree of hazy opacification on the right has substantially decreased. Much of this presumably reflects drainage of the pleural effusion, though there may be some contribution due to the more erect position of the patient. There is some increasing opacification at the left base consistent with a pleural effusion and atelectasis. Otherwise, little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
