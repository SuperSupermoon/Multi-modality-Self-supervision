As compared to the previous radiograph, the current image shows no evidence of an endotracheal tube and a nasogastric tube. The size of the cardiac silhouette has slightly increased. Also increased are bilateral areas of atelectasis and additional parenchymal opacities that could reflect pneumonia or aspiration. No pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax.
