The endotracheal tube is 5.7 cm above the carina. Right chest tube is at the right apex. Multiple right-sided rib fractures are again visualized. There is a right subclavian line with tip at the cavoatrial junction. Opacity at both apices suggests effusions versus hemothorax. There is volume loss at both bases . NG tube is in the proximal stomach with the proximal port just above the GE junction the T4 fracture cannot be assessed on these images
