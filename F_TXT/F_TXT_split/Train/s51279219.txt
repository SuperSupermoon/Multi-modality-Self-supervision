Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Cardiac size is top normal. The aorta is tortuous. Left lower lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis is unchanged. Right lower lobe peribronchial opacities are unchanged. These in the appropriate clinical setting are consistent with pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The patient has known emphysema. The main pulmonary arteries are minimally enlarged. Nodular opacity described in prior study in the right apex is not clearly visualized in this examination.
