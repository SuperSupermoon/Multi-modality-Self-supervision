The study is limited due to patient's large body habitus and resultant underpenetration. Low lung volumes are present. The heart size remains moderately enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Retrocardiac opacification could reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. Additionally, a small left-sided pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No large pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
