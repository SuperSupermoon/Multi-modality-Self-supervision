In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is continued opacification involving the lower portion of the right hemithorax with pigtail catheter in place. No evidence of pneumothorax. Opacification at the left base most likely reflects volume loss in the left lower lobe. There is some poor definition of the pulmonary vessels, which is consistent with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
