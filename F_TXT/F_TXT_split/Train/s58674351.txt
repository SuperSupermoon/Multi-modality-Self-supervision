The patient is status post recent right upper lobe resection, with a chest tube in place. Moderate-sized right apical pneumothorax persists, but a previously present fluid within the pleural space at the right apex is less apparent, possibly due to positional differences between the radiographs. Widening of right superior mediastinum appears unchanged in the post-operative period. No short relevant interval changes from the prior study except for worsening patchy right basilar opacity and development of patchy left basilar opacity, most likely due to atelectasis. Aspiration or developing pneumonia are also possible, and short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
