A Dobhoff tube is coiled in the hypopharynx and its distal end is looped in the stomach. Consider repositioning the Dobhoff tube. Mild pleural effusion on the right side and mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion are unchanged. Given the low lung volumes, presence of mild pulmonary edema may be exaggerated. Mild-to-moderately enlarged heart size and widened mediastinal contour is unchanged since at least ___. There is retrocardiac density in the left lower lung reflecting atelectasis is similar. There is a left-sided PICC line, with its tip in the subclavian vein, unchanged since at least ___.
