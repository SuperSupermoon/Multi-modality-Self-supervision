Lung volumes are slightly decreased when compared to the earlier study. The endotracheal tube is unchanged in position. A nasogastric tube has been advanced slightly but still terminates above or at the level the gastroesophageal junction. A side hole in the tube is within the esophagus. This should be advanced at least 8 cm for better positioning in the stomach. No pleural effusion, consolidation or pneumothorax seen.
