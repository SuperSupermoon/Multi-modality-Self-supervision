The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with calcification of the aortic knob redemonstrated as well as a calcified aortopulmonary window lymph node. The heart size is normal. Redemonstrated are ill-defined patchy opacities in the right lung base as well as within the left lung diffusely, which are not significantly changed from the prior study. These findings again may represent a combination of multifocal pneumonia and/or pulmonary edema. Underlying emphysematous changes are redemonstrated, with sparing of opacification in the right upper lobe. No pneumothorax is seen. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is compatible with a small effusion. Inferior vena cava filter is noted. Small round calcific densities are noted in the right upper quadrant, possibly gallstones.
