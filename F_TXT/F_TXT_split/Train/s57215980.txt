Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Subtle perihilar opacities suggest mild vascular engorgement. However, there is subtle patchy opacity over the right upper hemithorax, and underlying infection at this location is not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are similar with the cardiac silhouette mildly enlarged. No pneumothorax.
