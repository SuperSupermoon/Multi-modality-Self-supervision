The patient is markedly rotated limiting assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours but they are likely unchanged, although the aorta seems somewhat unfolded and tortuous. Lungs are grossly clear. No focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions.
