Supine portable AP view the chest provided. Endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing 4.9 cm above the carinal. An NG tube courses into the left upper quadrant. There is right basal atelectasis and possible tiny right pleural effusion. There is retrocardiac opacity which could reflect the presence of left lower lobe consolidation and possible effusion. There is no supine evidence for pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly within normal limits. Bony structures are intact.
