Left PICC tip is seen at the origin of the SVC, no longer within the azygos vein. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Left basilar atelectasis is similar. Mild opacity in the right upper lobe may be residual infection. The previous right lower lobe abnormality has cleared. No effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are stable allowing for patient position. Degenerative change is noted within the right shoulder girdle.
