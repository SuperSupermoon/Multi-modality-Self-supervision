As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Despite intubation and correct tube placement, the lung volumes remain low. Extent of the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities, more expressed at the right lung bases, are constant. Constant moderate cardiomegaly without signs of overt pulmonary edema. Unchanged minimal right pleural effusion. The position and course of the left subclavian access line and the nasogastric tube are constant.
