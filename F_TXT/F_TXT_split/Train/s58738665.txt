The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits and unchanged. The lungs demonstrate retrocardiac opacities as well as an opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle. An area of linear atelectasis in the right mid lung has progressed or perhaps this opacity may represent fluid in the minor fissure. A widespread mild-to-moderate interstitial abnormality involves the right lung with sparing of the left mid and upper lung. Blunting of both costophrenic angles suggest small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
