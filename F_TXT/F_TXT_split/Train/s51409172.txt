The endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 2 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip possibly within the distal stomach or proximal small bowel. Right subclavian PICC line as it has tip in the mid superior vena cava. Lung volumes remain low with patchy, predominantly basilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis. Pneumonia or aspiration would be less likely. Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
