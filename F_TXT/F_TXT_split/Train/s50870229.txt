Endotracheal tube is seen with tip approximately 3.3 cm from the carina. Enteric tube passes below the field of view and the tip is not included. Low lung volumes are noted with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings. No large confluent consolidation identified. Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
