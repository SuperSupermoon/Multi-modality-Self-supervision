Mild to moderate pulmonary edema has changed in distribution, now more pronounced in the right lower lobe, but not in overall severity. Heart size is normal. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial. Previously questioned left upper lobe lung nodule is not seen as clearly. Evaluation for pulmonary metastases would require chest CT scanning. Indwelling right PIC line ends in the right brachiocephalic vein.
