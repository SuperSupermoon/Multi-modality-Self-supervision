Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Perihilar opacities may relate to pulmonary fibrosis in this patient with sarcoid with underlying traction bronchiectasis. There is persistent scarring at the left lung base, blunting of the left costophrenic angle and upright elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Superimposed edema is difficult to exclude. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
