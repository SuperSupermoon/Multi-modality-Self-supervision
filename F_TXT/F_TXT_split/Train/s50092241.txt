There are no old films available for comparison. The heart is severely enlarged. There is complete obscuration of the left heart border and left hemidiaphragm, it is unclear how much of this is due to overlying soft tissue or if an infiltrate or effusion is present. There is blunting of the right CP angle. Again, it is unclear if this is due to overlying soft tissue or an effusion. The upper lungs are clear. A lateral film and old films would be helpful for more definitive diagnosis.
