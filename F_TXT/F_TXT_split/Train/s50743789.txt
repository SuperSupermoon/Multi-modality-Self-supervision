1. Lung volumes remain markedly diminished and there is now a diffuse airspace process which may reflect moderate pulmonary edema, less likely a superimposed infectious process. Due to marked patient rotation and low lung volumes, overall cardiac and mediastinal contours cannot be adequately assessed. No pneumothorax. 2. Endotracheal tube is unchanged in position with its tip approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
