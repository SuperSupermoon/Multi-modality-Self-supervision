Endotracheal tube ends at the level of the clavicle, approximately 6.4 cm above carina. Consider advancing the endotracheal tube by approximately 2-3 cm for appropriate seating. Right internal jugular line ends at upper/mid SVC and right PICC line terminates at mid SVC. Given the history of recent pericardial window for pericardial tamponade, tip of a new line ending extending to the middle of cardiac silhouette may represent pericardial drain catheter. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions associated with lower lung atelectasis, left side more than right, and mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Enlarged heart size and widened superior mediastinum is stable.
