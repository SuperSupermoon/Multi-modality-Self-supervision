In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube remains in good position, approximately 5 cm above the carina. Left subclavian catheter is in the mid portion of the SVC. The Dobbhoff tube has been repositioned, so that the opaque tip lies at least in the second portion of the duodenum where it crosses the lower margin of the image. Areas of increased opacification are seen at both bases, especially on the left. This most likely represents atelectasis with small pleural effusion. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
