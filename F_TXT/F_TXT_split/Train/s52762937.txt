The PICC line and NG tube have been removed. There are bilateral pleural effusions with volume loss in the right lower lobe. There continues to be dense retrocardiac opacity consistent with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution, which is increased somewhat compared to the prior. The heart size is moderately enlarged.
