The lung apices are not included on this study limiting observation. There is no definite pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. There is subcutaneous emphysema on the left as on the earlier study. Extensive postoperative changes are present. There is a left chest tube and mediastinal drains are present. Endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. Right central line tip is in the superior vena cava. Nasogastric tube tip is in the stomach. There is better aeration of the left lung as compared to the earlier study. There is an area of density in the left apex medially which could represent atelectasis, but correlation with surgical intervention that region is recommended. This may be accentuated by slight patient rotation to the left.
