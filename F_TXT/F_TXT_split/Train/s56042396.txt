AP chest compared to ___: Severe opacification has developed in the left lung, less pronounced on the right. This could be asymmetric edema or large-scale pneumonia on the left and mild edema on the right. Moderate left pleural effusion has increased. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube is in standard position. Right internal jugular line has advanced further into the SVC, upper enteric drainage tube ends in the distal part of non-distended stomach. There is also the suggestion of one or two new nodules in the periphery of the right lung. If these nodules persist, they could be due to disseminated infection, particularly septic emboli. Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at the time of dictation.
