A new endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position approximately 3.5 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. Since the prior exam, the moderate-sized right pleural effusion appears slightly increased in size. Bibasilar consolidations appear slightly worse, particularly on the right. This is consistent with multifocal pneumonia, likely with a component of increasing pulmonary edeam given the rapid interval change. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
