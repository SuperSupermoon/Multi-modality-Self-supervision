The endotracheal tube tip seats just below the level of the clavicular heads, 2 cm above the carina (although this inferior position is exaggerated by flexion of the neck). The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There is bibasilar atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions, both of which are greater on the left than the right. There is no pneumothorax. These opacities have progressed compared to yesterday.
