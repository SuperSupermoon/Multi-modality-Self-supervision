In comparison with the study of ___, there again is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with aortic valve replacement. There is elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, though this appears slightly less than on the previous study. Hazy opacification at the right base most likely represents layering pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis. The right subclavian PICC line again extends to about the junction of the brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
