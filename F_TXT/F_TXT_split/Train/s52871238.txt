The comparison is difficult because the previous exam was in the semi-erect position and now it is on erect position. There are still bilateral moderate pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis. The mild pulmonary edema has slightly decreased. Mild cardiac enlargement is stable. The patient has been extubated. The right jugular line ends in lower SVC. Left lower lobe atelectasis has not changed significantly.
