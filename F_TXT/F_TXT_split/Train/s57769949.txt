Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The previously seen left-sided PICC is no longer seen and likely removed in the interval. There are relatively low lung volumes. Haziness at the left lung base is likely due to overlying soft tissue. There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. No large pleural effusion is seen. No definite focal consolidation is seen, although a retrocardiac consolidation would be difficult to exclude on this study. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
