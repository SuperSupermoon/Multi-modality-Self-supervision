Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the aortic knob. Moderate pulmonary edema is similar to that seen on the previous examination. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, perhaps minimally decreased in the interval. Ill-defined consolidative airspace opacities in the lung bases are re- demonstrated, potentially reflecting a combination of atelectasis and infection or aspiration. No definite pneumothorax is detected on this examination, and a previously noted air-fluid level within the right lung base is not clearly delineated on the current exam.
