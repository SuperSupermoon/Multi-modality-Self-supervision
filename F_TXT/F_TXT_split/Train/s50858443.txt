Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier. Large right pleural effusion is unchanged. Allowing the difference in positioning of the patient, cardiac size is obscured by the pleural effusion. Left lower lobe opacity is a combination of atelectasis and small effusion. There are no new lung opacities. Left IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. Sternal wires are aligned.
