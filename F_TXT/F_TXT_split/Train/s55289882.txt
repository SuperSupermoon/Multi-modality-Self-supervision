AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. The patient is intubated, the ETT terminates in the trachea some 4 cm above the level of the carina. An NG tube reaches well below the diaphragm. Single view chest examination does not demonstrate marked cardiac enlargement but there exist bilateral scattered parenchymal densities and thickening of the pleural space, most marked on the right side. As these scattered infiltrates may relate to the clinically coded endocarditis, further evaluation with CT is recommended.
