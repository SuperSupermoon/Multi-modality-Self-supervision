A right-sided chest tube is noted. No pneumothorax is detected. There are low inspiratory volumes, with bibasilar atelectasis, including patchy retrocardiac opacities, similar to prior. Mild vascular plethora is unchanged, likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. No gross effusion. Spinal fixation hardware is again noted, similar in configuration, not fully evaluated on this study.
