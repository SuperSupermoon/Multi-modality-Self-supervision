A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. An elliptical left perihilar mass-like opacity is not clearly seen on prior studies, although the patient was previously rotated on multiple priors. A chronic left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is similar to the prior study allowing for lower lung volumes. There has been interval removal of the right PICC. Right basilar atelectasis persists. No right pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. The patient is status post CABG.
