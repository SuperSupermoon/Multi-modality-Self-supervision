Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.5 cm above the level of carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. The left-sided chest tube is seen, similar in position. There is a right-sided subclavian central venous catheter in similar position, terminating in the right atrium. There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and overlying atelectasis. The overlying atelectasis and left basilar opacity is slightly increased, which could be due to atelectasis, although a developing infection is not excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
