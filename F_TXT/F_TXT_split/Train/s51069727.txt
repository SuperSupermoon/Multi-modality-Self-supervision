AP view of the torso centered at the diaphragm, excluding the lateral left upper abdomen shows an upper enteric drainage tube ending in a non-distended stomach as well as upper abdominal drains, skin ___ and a Swan-Ganz catheter ending in the right pulmonary artery. Small amount of perihepatic air is presumably residual surgery. The imaged portion of the lower lungs clear and heart size is normal.
