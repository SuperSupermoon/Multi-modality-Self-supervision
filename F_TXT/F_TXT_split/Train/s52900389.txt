A right-sided PICC is in place with tip in upper SVC in unchanged position. Visualization of the Dobbhoff tube is difficult due to limited beam penetration, however, the tube is visualized to course below the diaphragm with tip terminating in the expected location of the gastric body. Lung volumes are decreased in comparison with the previous examination with increase in bibasilar atelectasis. A small right-sided pleural effusion is unchanged. No pneumothorax. Osseous structures unchanged. Trace left pleural effusion is unchanged.
