In comparison to the most recent prior study, an endotracheal tube is seen terminating at the level of the thoracic inlet. A nasogastric tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip terminating in the left upper quadrant, likely within the stomach. A left internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged in position with the tip terminating at the confluence with the SVC. Areas of airspace opacity are again noted in the right lung apex and left lung base, which are gradually worsening over multiple prior studies. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are also unchanged.
