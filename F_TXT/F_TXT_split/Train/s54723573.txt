Postoperative pulmonary consolidation, particularly severe in the right perihilar and left upper lungs has worsened progressively. Cardiac portion of the postoperative mediastinal silhouette is stable but upper mediastinal widening suggests vascular congestion. It is difficult to distinguish worsening multifocal pneumonia from pulmonary edema on conventional radiographs but subsequent chest radiographs and chest CT scan available to time of this review show that much of the abnormality, subsequently improved, is edema. The more peripheral components could be small areas of concurrent pneumonia or even pulmonary hemorrhage. An upper enteric drainage tube ends in the lower esophagus, repositioned appropriately on conventional chest radiographs. Right jugular line ends at the superior caval atrial junction.
