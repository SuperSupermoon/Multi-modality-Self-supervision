The endotracheal tube terminates 5.4 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip in the stomach. Consolidation within the right base may reflect aspiration or pneumonia, and is better characterized on concurrent CT. Silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm suggests probable basilar atelectasis. The upper lungs are clear. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Moderately severe cardiomegaly is stable.
