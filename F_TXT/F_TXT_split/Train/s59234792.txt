CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW No pneumothorax is detected. There are small left-greater-than-right pleural effusions. On the left, the effusion is larger and on the right it is smaller than on ___ at 15:46 p.m. Again seen are sternotomy wires and moderate-to-moderately-severe cardiomegaly, with upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with mild CHF. The right IJ central line tip is again seen over the mid/distal SVC. There is underlying collapse and/or consolidation at the left base with new obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.
