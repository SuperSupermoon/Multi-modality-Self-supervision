One AP portable upright view of the chest. Previously seen bibasilar opacities have decreased, now with only left lower lobe linear opacities likely representing atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. No pneumothorax.
