AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in steep semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the frontal view of the PA and lateral chest examination of ___. A right-sided chest tube has been approached via the lower lateral chest wall and terminates in the right-sided apical area. There is a hazy density in the area of the previously described right superior mediastinal mass. There is a very small pleural separation in the upper lateral pleural space area but less than 2 mm. A significant pneumothorax in the apical area cannot be identified. Lung tissue remains well aerated and unchanged in comparison with the pre-operative examination. No evidence of new parenchymal infiltrates and no signs of pulmonary vascular congestion.
