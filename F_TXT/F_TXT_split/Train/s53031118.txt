Right Port-A-Cath remains in place. Interval decrease in the right pleural effusion with improved aeration at the right base and some residual atelectasis. There is a smaller basilar medial opacity which could reflect residual loculated fluid or pleural thickening. The smaller left effusion remains unchanged. Patchy opacities at the left base are suggestive of atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. Old right midclavicular fracture.
