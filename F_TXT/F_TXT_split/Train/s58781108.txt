Single supine AP radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube which appears to terminate 2.8 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube descends the thorax in an uncomplicated course, its tip projecting over the right upper quadrant in appropriate position. Relative to prior study, enteric tube has been advanced. Subtle left perihilar and lower lobe opacity could reflect aspiration. There is no pleural effusion identified. There is no pneumothorax.
