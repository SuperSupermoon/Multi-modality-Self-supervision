AP portable supine view of the chest. There has been interval intubation. The endotracheal tube tip is positioned fairly high in the trachea approximately 6.4 cm above the carina. An NG tube is seen coursing inferiorly along the thoracic midline to the upper abdomen though the tip is out of the field of view. Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted. Right upper lobe consolidations consistent with pneumonia. Hilar congestion and likely mild interstitial pulmonary edema present. Cardiomegaly again noted.
