A new consolidation in the left lower lobe obscuring the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with a pneumonia. There is a small left pleural effusion which is better seen on prior CT chest. Again seen is right basal atelectasis. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Severe cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pneumothorax.
