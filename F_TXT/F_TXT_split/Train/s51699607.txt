A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Bilateral, multifocal areas of consolidation appear relatively unchanged. Stable, small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Previously seen free intra-abdominal air is not identified on the current study, but given that this is not a true upright radiograph, pneumoperitoneum cannot be excluded. Recommend repeat upright PA and lateral radiographs or CT for definitive evaluation of intra-abdominal free air.
