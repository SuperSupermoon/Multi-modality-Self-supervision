In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure is suggested and there are atelectatic changes especially at the left base. In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of a supervening pneumonia in the lower left lung would have to be considered. Of incidental note is again evidence of previous trauma involving the distal right clavicle.
