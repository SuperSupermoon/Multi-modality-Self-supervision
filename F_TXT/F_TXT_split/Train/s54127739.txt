Subtle areas of lucency overlie the left lung which suggest that the pneumothorax is persistent. The extensive subcutaneous emphysema within the soft tissues of the neck, left shoulder and left flank is unchanged. A definite pleural contour is not seen. Multiple displaced right posterior rib fractures are unchanged. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is slightly worse. There is left basilar atelectasis obscuring the hemidiaphragm. The hilar and mediastinal contours are otherwise normal. There is no pleural effusion.
