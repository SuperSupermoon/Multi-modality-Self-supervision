As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the aortic balloon pump, are unchanged. The lungs continue to be overinflated but there is a minimal new left pleural effusion with subsequent atelectasis at the left lung bases. On the right, the costophrenic sinus is also blunted, which might be explained by a minimal right pleural effusion. Mild atelectasis at both lung bases. No overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
