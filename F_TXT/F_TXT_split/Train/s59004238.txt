Slightly increased density at the lung basez is may represent vascular engorgement or atelectasis. There is suggestion of increased density in the retrocardiac region, which also may be due to atelectasis. Heart size is enlarged. Aortic calcification is seen. No pneumothorax is detected. No frank pulmonary edema is detected but pulmonary vessels are engorged. Small effusion may be present. Dual-lead pacing hardware is noted. Hardware projecting over the right subcutaneous tissues is likely external to the patient.
