Single frontal view of the chest. Lung volumes are low, exaggerating heart size, which is top normal. Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable. Undulating contours of aortic calcifications could represent an ectatic aorta. Retrocardiac and right lung base linear opacities are compatible with atelectasis. Indistinct appearance of the left costophrenic angle suggests a small pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. No radiopaque foreign body.
