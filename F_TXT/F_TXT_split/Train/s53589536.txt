The endotracheal tube tip appears to have migrated more proximally and is now 6 cm above the carina above the clavicular heads. There is a right-sided chest tube, unchanged in position. Heart size is prominent but stable. Median sternotomy wires and numerous pericardial clips are seen. There are low lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings. There remains a right perihilar opacity but is slightly improved. Atelectasis at the lung bases are unchanged. There are no pneumothoraces. Partial resection of the right posterior fourth rib is again seen.
