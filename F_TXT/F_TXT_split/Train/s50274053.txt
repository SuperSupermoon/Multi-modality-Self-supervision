Compared with prior radiographs on ___, the PA catheter still positioned peripherally in the right descending pulmonary artery, and should be withdrawn approximately 5 cm for standard placement. A right PICC line terminates in the mid to low SVC. There is no change in a small right and a moderate left pleural effusion. There is mild vascular congestion, and possible edema in the left lower lobe versus atelectasis. Cardiomegaly is stable. Median sternotomy wires are stable in position.
