There has been interval placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter which projects over the lateral aspect of the right mid hemithorax on the frontal view with near-complete resolution of the previously seen pneumothorax. There has been interval re-expansion of the right lung. Hazy opacification within the right lung base might reflect an area of residual atelectasis. The left lung remains unchanged with emphysema again noted. Previously noted shift of mediastinal structures to the left has resolved. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
