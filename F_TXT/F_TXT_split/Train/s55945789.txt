CAROTID ARTERY STENT AND TRACHEOSTOMY TUBE REMAIN IN PLACE. SLIGHT DECREASE IN THE WIDTH OF MEDIASTINAL VASCULAR PEDICLE. ASYMMETRICALLY DISTRIBUTED BILATERAL ALVEOLAR OPACITIES CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE RIGHT LUNG TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN THE LEFT, AND MAY REFLECT ASYMMETRICAL EDEMA IN THE SETTING OF COEXISTING SEPTAL LINES SUGGESTIVE OF INTERSTITIAL EDEMA. FOLLOWUP RADIOGRAPHS AFTER DIURESIS MAY BE HELPFUL TO EXCLUDE OTHER UNDERLYING PROCESS SUCH AS PNEUMONIA. BILATERAL SMALL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS ARE ALSO DEMONSTRATED.
