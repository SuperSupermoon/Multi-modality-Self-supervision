Comparison is made to the previous study from ___. Endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and right IJ central line are unchanged in position. The distal tip of the right IJ line is again in the proximal right atrium and could be pulled back 1 to 2 cm for more optimal placement. There are no pneumothoraces. There remains minimal pulmonary edema.
