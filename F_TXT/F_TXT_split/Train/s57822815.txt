As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone spine stabilization surgery. According devices project over the spine and the mediastinum, partly obliterating the visualization of the endotracheal tube. Therefore, the tip of the tube cannot be directly visualized. The lower parts of the nasogastric tube project over the stomach. The left PICC line is in unchanged position. Unchanged is a moderate retrocardiac atelectasis, combined to minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small left pleural effusion. There is no convincing evidence of pneumothorax. Minimal atelectasis at the bases of the right lung. Known right clavicular fracture. No pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumonia.
