The endotracheal tube has been withdrawn with tip now lying approximately 3.8 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube again remains within the stomach. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Patchy opacities are present within both lung bases, likely atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
