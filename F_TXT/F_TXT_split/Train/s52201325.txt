Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There is no pulmonary edema. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, tortuous aorta, and mildly widened mediastinum are stable. Right pleural effusion tracking in the fissure and adjacent opacities, likely atelectases, are chronic. Left lower lobe opacities have improved. Remaining opacities reflect atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Calcified hilar lymph nodes are again noted.
