As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left-sided airway stent. The stent is barely visible on the chest radiograph. Areas of parenchymal opacities have newly appeared in the right upper lobe and at the left lung bases. The morphology and distribution of the changes suggests pneumonia. Post interventional hemorrhage would be an alternative differential diagnosis. The enlarged left hilus is less well appreciated than on the previous image. No pleural effusions. Unchanged normal cardiac silhouette.
