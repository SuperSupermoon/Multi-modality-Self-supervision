Since ___, the opacification of most the left hemithorax is unchanged with associated slight leftward shift of the mediastinum, corresponding to mucous plug and associated collapse of the left lower lung. The visualized aerated left upper lung is overall unchanged. An underlying left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. The appearance of the right hemithorax is overall unchanged. Hazy opacification of the right hemithorax in a semi-upright film, suggestive of a layering right pleural effusion. No pulmonary edema, focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia, or pneumothorax. No change in the position of the ETT tube, NG tube, and right PICC line.
