Endotracheal tube tip is 3.6 cm from the carina. Enteric tube seen with tip at the gastric fundus, side-port likely just past the GE junction. Linear opacities at the lung bases are most likely atelectasis. Given low lung volumes, lungs are otherwise grossly clear where not obscured by overlying lines. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities.
