Right subclavian central line with its tip in the distal SVC. Tracheostomy tube remains in place. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There continues to be a diffuse bilateral airspace process with layering effusions which is not significantly changed. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No obvious pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-erect technique.
