An ill-defined nodule in the right lower lobe corresponds to the biopsied spiculated nodule, better characterized on the PET-CT. A new clip is present. There is no new opacity, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Interstitial abnormalities and hyperinflation are likely related to emphysema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
