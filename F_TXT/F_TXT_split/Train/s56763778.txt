Since the prior study of 1 day earlier, the patient has been intubated with endotracheal tube in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Lungs are remarkable for new patchy left retrocardiac opacity, which may reflect atelectasis, contusion, or aspiration. Tiny left pneumothorax seen on recent CT is not well demonstrated on this portable semi erect chest radiograph.
