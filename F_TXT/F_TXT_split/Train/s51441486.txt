AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained nine hours earlier during the same day. During the interval, the right-sided chest tube terminating in the right apical area has been removed. The lower placed chest tube remains. There exists a pleural thickening in the apical area which was present before the tube removal. No newly developed pneumothorax can be identified.
