Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained on ___. After left thoracocentesis, there is substantial interval decrease in pleural effusion, currently small-to-moderate, with associated opacity, most likely reflecting re-expanding pulmonary edema. Right pleural effusion is moderate, potentially minimally increased since the prior study. Cardiomegaly is substantial. Upper zone redistribution of vasculature is noted that might reflect hypoxemia in the lower lobes with shift of the vasculature to the upper lobes. No pneumothorax is seen.
