As compared to the prior study, there has been progression of bibasal consolidation potentially associated with pleural effusion. Mild vascular engorgement cannot be excluded especially given the presence of distended azygos vein. The subsequent study obtained the same day later at 8:39 p.m. demonstrated resolution of vascular engorgement but persistence of bibasal consolidation thus concerning for infectious process, potentially in combination with progression of interstitial lung disease in the lung bases.
