Interval placement of a right basilar pigtail catheter with improved aeration in the right hemithorax consistent with resolving pleural effusion. There is persistent airspace opacity in the right lung likely reflecting persistent atelectasis, although pulmonary contusion or superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Patchy peripheral left upper lobe opacity and left retrocardiac opacity also likely reflect areas of pulmonary contusion, aspiration or atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Overall left-sided cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable. Stable thoracic scoliosis. No acute bony abnormality appreciated.
