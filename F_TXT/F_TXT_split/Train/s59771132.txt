Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___:44. Small right pleural effusion is likely. No right pneumothorax. Right basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter in place. Consolidation in the right lower lung is worsening, and there is new consolidation at the periphery of the left lower lung. As discussed previously pulmonary edema can distribute very asymmetrically in a patient with emphysema as severe as this, but pneumonia is the major concern. Heart size has increased slightly but mediastinal veins have never dilated. ET tube tip at the thoracic inlet is no less than 7 cm from the carina. It should be advanced 2 cm for more secure positioning. Nasogastric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
