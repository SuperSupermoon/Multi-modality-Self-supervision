A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained. Right basilar atelectasis has increased since yesterday's exam. A curvilinear lucent line is newly noted at the right lung apex. It is difficult to assess for lung markings beyond this line due to overlying rib shadows. Tracheostomy tube remains in the upper trachea. A left internal jugular catheter ends in the upper SVC. Dual-chamber pacing leads project in unchanged positions. A Dobbhoff tube is seen in the stomach. A mitral valve ring is in unchanged position.
