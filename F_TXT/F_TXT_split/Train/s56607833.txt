As compared to the previous radiograph, there are symmetrical bilateral parenchymal opacities that slightly increased in extent and severity. The morphology of these changes, however, is more likely to reflect pulmonary edema than pneumonia. A small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Moderate cardiomegaly. No changes at the level of the lung apices. Sternal wires and right internal jugular vein catheter in unchanged position.
