Single portable AP view of the chest demonstrates diffuse reticular and nodular opacities, not significantly changed since the prior study, and in keeping with a fibrotic chronic interstitial lung disease. There is evidence of linear atelectasis within the right mid lung, as well as bibasilar atelectasis. A small area of patchy opacification within the right lower lung, along the right hemidiaphragm, could represent atelectasis or pulmonary fibrosis alone, however a superimposed infectious process cannot be completely excluded. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is identified. Known hiatal hernia is not as well appreciated on this study.
