Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Right basilar opacity and patchy opacity projecting over the right mid lung are worrisome for pneumonia. There is also patchy lateral left base opacity, which may be due to chronic changes, although an additional site of infection is not excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable and stable.
