Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increased opacification of the bilateral bases, right greater than left, which likely represents atelectasis and/or aspiration, but pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. The mediastinum appears wide. The heart is not enlarged. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Endotracheal tube ends 4.9 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view.
