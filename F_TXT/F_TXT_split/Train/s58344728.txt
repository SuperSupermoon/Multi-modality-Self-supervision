The patient remains intubated. A right subclavian introducer catheter has been placed, which terminates probably at the level of the confluence of right internal jugular and subclavian veins. A left-sided chest tube has also been placed. Lucency projecting over the left lower chest is stable and perception of a possible pneumothorax is likely artifactual. A left lower mediastinal contour abnormality has been reduced. An orogastric tube courses into the left upper quadrant, its full course not visualized. Streaky left lower lobe opacity is worrisome for a contusion.
