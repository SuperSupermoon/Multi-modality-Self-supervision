A left-sided pacemaker generator is in unchanged position. Leads are intact and terminate in the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged from prior. There are diffuse increased interstitial opacities, which may be secondary to atypical infection or mild pulmonary edema. There are possible small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.
