There is a pleural catheter projecting over the right lateral sulcus, which is sharply folded and could be occluded. Clinical assessment is necessary. At the medial aspect of the right lung projecting over the mediastinum is an irregular contour, which could represent the pleural surface against the medial pneumothorax. This is of particular concern since there is more than previous leftward mediastinal shift, even though there is still small left pleural effusion. There is no pleural air along the other aspects of the right lung. Dr. ___ was paged at 8:30 a.m. and we discussed these findings by telephone at 8:32 a.m., including the indication for repeat conventional chest radiographs this morning. Fusion port ends in the low SVC. Heart is not enlarged. The visible portions of the left lung are normal. There could be subcutaneous gas in the left chest wall or the heterogeneity and radiodensity could be due to skin folds.
