As compared to the previous radiograph, the venous introduction sheath in the right internal jugular vein has been replaced by a right internal jugular vein central venous catheter. Tip of the catheter projects over the mid SVC, there is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. Pre-existing parenchymal opacity at the right lung base has decreased. The transparency of the lung parenchyma at the left lung base is also increased, potentially reflecting increased ventilation. However, moderate cardiomegaly with minimal fluid overload and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta persist.
