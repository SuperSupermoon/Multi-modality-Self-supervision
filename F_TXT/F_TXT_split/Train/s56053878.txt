Multiple intact sternal wires denote prior cardiac surgical history. A right IJ catheter is unchanged in position. There has been interval extubation and removal of an orogastric tube. A large gastric bubble is now present. The heart size is top normal. Hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. There is mild central bronchopulmonary crowding secondary to low lung volumes; however, no overt edema is seen.
