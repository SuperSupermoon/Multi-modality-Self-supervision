SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST CENTERED LOW TO EVALUATE THE NG TUBE. An NG tube is present -- the tip lies expected position of the gastric body. A right IJ central line is present, tip at SVC/RA junction, perhaps over upper right atrium. A drain or catheter overlies the upper right abdomen. There are low inspiratory volumes, with bibasilar atelectasis. Heart size is borderline. Allowing for low lung volumes, there is borderline upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. No gross effusion. Compared with ___ at 4:05 a.m., collapse/consolidation at the left base is slightly improved, the ET tube has been removed, and the NG tube has been placed.
