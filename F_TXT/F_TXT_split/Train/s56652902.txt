Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.3 cm above the carina within the mid thoracic trachea. There is a left chest Port-A-Cath with distal tip overlying the mid SVC. A right chest cardiac device with associated single lead appears in grossly appropriate configuration. An enteric tube courses inferiorly with distal tip projecting below the lower limit of the radiograph. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There are diffuse, bilateral nearly confluent multifocal airspace opacities. There is likely a small to moderate left pleural effusion. There may be a trace/small right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
