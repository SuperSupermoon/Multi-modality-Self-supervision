AP chest compared to ___, 2:16 a.m.: I do not see a Dobbhoff or other feeding tube in the neck or chest. An upper enteric drainage tube ends in the lower esophagus and would need to be advanced 15 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. Mild pulmonary edema unchanged. Greater opacification in the right lower lung could be either asymmetric edema or concurrent pneumonia, particularly aspiration, but after worsening between ___, it has remained stable over the course of the day. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, increased since ___, subsequently stable. Pleural effusion is small if any. No pneumothorax.
