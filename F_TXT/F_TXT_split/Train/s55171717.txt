1. Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. Interval placement of a left subclavian central line with its tip in the distal SVC. Nasogastric tube remains in place with the tip projecting over the stomach. There has been interval appearance of bilateral diffuse airspace disease with more opacity in the right lower and left upper lung. Although these findings may represent pulmonary edema, given the recent history of cardiac arrest, pulmonary hemorrhage and/or aspiration should also be considered. Lung volumes are diminished. The heart appears mildly enlarged with a somewhat globular configuration raising concern for a pericardial effusion. Clinical correlation is advised. Apparent lucency in the left deep costophrenic sulcus may be artifactual but would raise the possibility of an anterior pneumothorax. This can be better evaluated on followup imaging.
