Compared with the earlier film, the left hemidiaphragm is now completely obscured, with air bronchograms seen in the retrocardiac region, consistent with worsening left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Pulmonary vascular plethora is again noted. Possible mild interstitial edema. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be very slightly worse. Patchy opacity at the right base is again noted, not significantly changed, question atelectasis.
