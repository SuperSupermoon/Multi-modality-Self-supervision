The very tip of the ET tube is visualized at the thoracic inlet. The nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach. Lung volumes are low. Bibasilar consolidations are better visualized on the current CT torso. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to evaluate due to the AP lordotic projection, but the left heart border is straightened and the possibility of some leftward shoft cannot be excluded. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. No displaced fractures identified. (Please see other contemporaneous studies showing left humeral fracture, not directly imaged on this exam).
