AP chest compared to ___: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has changed in distribution, improved slightly, with particular clearing in the right upper lobe. Bibasilar opacification is probably a combination of atelectasis and small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion, but concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded radiographically. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. No pneumothorax. Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are in standard positions. Feeding tube ends at the gastroesophageal junction, would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. No pneumothorax.
