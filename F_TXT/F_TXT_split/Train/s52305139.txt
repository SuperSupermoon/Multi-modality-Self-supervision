Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is seen within the chest wall and neck. A left chest tube tip projects over the medial mid lung field. A small left pneumothorax is demonstrated, though the assessment of this is limited by the overlying extensive subcutaneous emphysema. Heart size is normal. No rightward shift of the mediastinum is demonstrated. Focal opacity within the left lung base could reflect infection or aspiration. Multiple left-sided rib fractures are re- demonstrated.
