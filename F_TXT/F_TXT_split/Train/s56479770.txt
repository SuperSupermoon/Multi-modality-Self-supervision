There is minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle suggestive of a trace effusion. No pneumothorax is seen, and there is no right-sided pleural effusion. Ill-defined nodular opacities are noted within the right mid lung field, which could reflect areas of infection or inflammation. No focal consolidation is demonstrated.
