Supine portable AP chest radiograph is obtained. Underlying trauma board limits evaluation. The lateral most aspect of the right CP angle is excluded. There is streaky opacity in the right upper lung which could represent a small amount of aspiration or atelectasis. The lungs appear otherwise clear, though lung volumes are low. No large consolidation is seen. No supine evidence of pneumothorax or effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable. Bony structures appear intact.
