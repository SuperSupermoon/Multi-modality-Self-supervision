Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There has been removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter. There remains a right IJ Cordis with the distal lead tip in the proximal SVC. Median sternotomy wires are seen. There has been removal of the right-sided chest tube at the base. There remains a left-sided chest tube at the base. There is cardiomegaly. There is a right-sided pleural effusion and right basilar opacity, stable. There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm partially due to a large gastric air bubble. This causes crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings at the left base causing atelectasis. There remains a mild pulmonary edema, stable.
