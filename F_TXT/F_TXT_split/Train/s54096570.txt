Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates stable left subclavian approach central venous catheter with tip in the lower SVC. A right transjugular catheter sheath is in stable position. The ET tube terminates 5 cm above the carina. A small caliber enteric tube traverses below the diaphragm and out of view. A previously seen left basilar pleural chest tube has been removed without obvious pneumothorax. Dense retrocardiac atelectasis or consolidation is unchanged, consistent with persistent left lower lobe collapse. The right lung is well aerated.
