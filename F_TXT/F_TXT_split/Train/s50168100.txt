Lung volumes are low, likely resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular structures an accentuation of heart size. Despite this, there appears to be new, mild pulmonary edema and increased, moderate cardiomegaly. There is no definite focal consolidation, but bibasilar atelectasis is possible. Pleural effusions are small, if any. A right-sided PICC remains coiled in the right internal jugular vein, but the tip has retracted somewhat and terminates within the internal jugular vein itself. A a presumed VP shunt is overall unchanged in position. A tracheostomy, median sternotomy wires, and valve replacement are again noted.
