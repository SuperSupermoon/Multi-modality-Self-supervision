A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC. A Dobbhoff tube is seen ending within the upper portion of the stomach, although the proximal portion of its floppy end is in the distal esophagus. Previously, the entirety of the Dobbhoff tube ended within the lower esophagus. Lung volumes remain very low, although slightly improved compared to the prior study from ___. There is minimal bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. Apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely at least partially attributable to low lung volumes. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. There are no definite pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.
