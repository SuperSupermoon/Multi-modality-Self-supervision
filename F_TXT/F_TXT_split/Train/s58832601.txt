AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained three hours earlier during the same day. The previously described two right-sided apical and lateral pneumothorax measuring 2-3 cm has diminished slightly. At least, there is certainly no new pulmonary collapse. No new increased pneumothorax or mediastinal emphysema can be identified. Previously described right-sided chest tube remains in unchanged position. Again previously described mitral valve prosthesis can be identified in unchanged position.
