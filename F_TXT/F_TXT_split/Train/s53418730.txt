The heart size is difficult to evaluate, but there is suggestion of a left ventricular configuration and possibly mild-to-moderate cardiac enlargement. There is mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left, and lung volumes are low overall. Patchy opacity obscures the left cardiac border and left costophrenic angle. In addition, there is diffuse mildly increased prominence of the pulmonary vascularity, including indistinct upper zone redistribution. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax, although a small pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.
