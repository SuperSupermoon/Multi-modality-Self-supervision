CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 5:11 a.m. and allowing for technical differences, there may be slightly increased opacity in the left mid zone. Otherwise, no significant change is detected. Again seen is opacity at the left base, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. The right lung and right costophrenic sulcus remain grossly clear. Also again noted is a fracture through the mid-shaft of the left clavicle and multiple left-sided rib fractures. No pneumothorax is detected.
