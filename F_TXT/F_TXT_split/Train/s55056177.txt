Left-sided PICC line tip terminates at the mid SVC. The tip of an additional catheter is seen terminating in the axilla on the right. Tracheostomy tube projects over the thoracic midline. As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is a dense consolidation in the right lower lobe extending superiorly towards the minor fissure. There has been interval increase of the right sided pleural effusion. There is a right sided perihilar opacity which may occupy the superior segment of the right lower lobe. A persistent left-sided pleural effusion precludes the ability to see through the heart, cannot exclude retrocardial atelectasis. There is mild superimposed pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
