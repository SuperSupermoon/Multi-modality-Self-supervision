As compared to the previous radiograph, there is now a near total opacification of the left hemithorax. Only a minimal known obliterated lung area is seen at the lung apex. Here, there is no evidence of pulmonary parenchymal structures, so that a pleural air inclusion could be present. The right hemithorax has decreased in volume and is otherwise unchanged.
