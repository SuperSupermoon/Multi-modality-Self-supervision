The ETT tip projects approximately 6 cm from the carina with the neck probably in extension. This could probably be further advanced 1-2 cm. An enteric tube tip projects over in the expected region of a distended stomach, but the side port is above the diaphragm probably in the distal esophagus or near the GE junction. This could be advanced by approximately 7-10 cm. No consolidation, effusion, edema, or pneumothorax. Elevation with tenting of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with atelectasis/ volume loss, likely related to prior right upper lobe wedge resection. The heart is top-normal in size.
