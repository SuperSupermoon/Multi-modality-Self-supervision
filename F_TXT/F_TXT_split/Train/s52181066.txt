Endotracheal tube ends 6.5 cm from carina, just above the level of clavicles. Consider advancing ET tube by 2-3 cm for appropriate seating. A right internal jugular line extends to mid/lower SVC and orogastric tube ends in the stomach. Both lungs are remarkable for bilateral perihilar opacities, left side more than right and mild-to-moderate right and minimal left pleural effusion. Though these findings favor pulmonary edema, concurrent pneumonia cannot be ruled out. Right renal nephrostomy tube is present. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
