A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates continued opacification of the lingula, superimposed on chronic left lower lobe collapse. Heterogeneous left perihilar opacities are unchanged from ___, but slightly increased from ___. Right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged, as is mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Engorgement of the mediastinal vessels is also unchanged and suggestive of elevated central venous pressure. There is no pneumothorax. A left-sided pleural effusion cannot be excluded. A left PICC has been advanced slightly, and now no longer abuts the lateral wall of the SVC, terminating in the mid portion of the SVC.
