There is no evidence of apical pneumothorax, but a minimal ventral pneumothorax could be present at the site of tube insertion. The right lung is better expanded than before, with an area of right basal postoperative atelectasis. Air collection in the right lateral soft tissues. Unchanged appearance of the left lung.
