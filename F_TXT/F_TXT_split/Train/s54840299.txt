Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. Pacer and lead tips are unchanged. The heart remains mildly enlarged. There is a clip at the right pulmonary hilum. The previously noted patchy consolidation within the right mid and lower lung appears slightly improved, though incompletely resolved. There is subtle retrocardiac left lower lobe opacity which could in part represent atelectasis or bronchovascular crowding in the setting of low lung volumes, though the possibility of a pneumonic consolidation is not excluded. No large pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
