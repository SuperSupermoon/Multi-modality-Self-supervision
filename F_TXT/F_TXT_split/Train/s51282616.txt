The nasogastric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm and terminates in the stomach. Compared with the prior study, lung volumes remain low with small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. There is associated bibasilar atelectasis. The heart is top-normal in size. Sternal wires are intact. No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
