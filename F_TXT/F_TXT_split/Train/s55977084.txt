An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position 4 cm above the level the carina. An enteric feeding tube is seen coursing midline with tip in stomach and side ports below level of the diaphragm. The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature and mild pulmonary edema. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis is present. Small bilateral, left greater than right, pleural effusions. A tiny right pneumothorax as well as mild right pneumomediastinum is present. Mild mediastinal widening is likely related to patient positioning and low lung volumes.
