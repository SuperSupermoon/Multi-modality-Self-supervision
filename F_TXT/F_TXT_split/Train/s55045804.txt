AP chest compared to ___: Moderate cardiomegaly has improved, and previous pulmonary edema has resolved. Mediastinal caliber is normal, and the mild dilatation of upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is less pronounced. All findings point to improved cardiac function. A supraclavicular dual-channel dialysis catheter ends in the right atrium. If there is a bilateral lower extremity edema, the explanation might lie in the inferior vena cava or both femoral veins.
