Overlying trauma board slightly limits assessment. The patient is status post median sternotomy and valve replacement. Heart size is top normal. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. The left sulcus appears deep compared to the right, concerning for a pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis though infection, aspiration, or contusion is not excluded. The right lung is clear. No right-sided pneumothorax is seen on the supine exam. Multiple clips are demonstrated projecting over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Right seventh lateral rib fracture is noted.
