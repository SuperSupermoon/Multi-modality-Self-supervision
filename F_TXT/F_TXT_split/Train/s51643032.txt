There is CHF, with interstitial edema. There is increased retrocardiac density, with obscuration of of left hemidiaphragm, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation, but note is also made that the left hemi diaphragm is probably slightly elevated. There is a probable small left effusion. There is also atelectasis at the right lung base. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The heart is mildly enlarged. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Gas seen along the upper abdominal wall on the right is not fully characterized, but could lie within the hepatic flexure of the colon.
