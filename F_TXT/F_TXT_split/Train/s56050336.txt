There has been interval increase in the bilateral parenchymal opacities, with more confluent opacities in the right lung. Appearances are consistent with worsening pulmonary edema although superimposed infection cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion seen. The heart size remains mildly enlarged even allowing for the projection. No pneumothorax. A left-sided PICC line terminates in the proximal SVC.
