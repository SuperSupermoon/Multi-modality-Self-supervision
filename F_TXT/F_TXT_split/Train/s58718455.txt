As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The patient shows bilateral areas of consolidation. At both lung bases. The extent of these areas is without major interval change. The location and symmetrical bilateral distribution of the changes favors atelectasis over pneumonia. The overall appearance of the lungs is constant. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged monitoring and support devices. Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
