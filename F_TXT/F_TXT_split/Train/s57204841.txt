Single AP view of the chest was reviewed. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with enlargement of the right pulmonary artery. Apparent slight blunting of both costophrenic angles may be due to overlying soft tissues. There is no pneumothorax. The lungs are well expanded with moderate pulmonary edema, worsened compared to the prior studies.
