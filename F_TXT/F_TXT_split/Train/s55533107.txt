As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is after bronchoscopy. There is relatively extensive presence of post-bronchoscopy right-sided parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting combination of edema and hemorrhage. Close radiographic monitoring for resolution is required. The changes surround the 3-cm nodule seen in the right upper lobe. There is no pleural effusion. The lung volumes are low. Moderate cardiomegaly with mild areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases.
