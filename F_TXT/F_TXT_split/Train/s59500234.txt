The right internal jugular Cordis catheter projects over the upper SVC. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea. The tip of the gastric tube projects below the level the diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph. A left PICC line is present, the tip projects somewhat well lateral to the expected location of the superior cavoatrial junction however this may be due to patient rotation. If there is ongoing concern for PICC small placement, PA and lateral chest radiographs could be obtained. Low bilateral lung volumes. Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect atelectasis and/or consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal.
