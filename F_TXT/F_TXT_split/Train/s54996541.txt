The examination is limited secondary to patient rotation. The tracheostomy tube projects in the craniocaudal dimension. Right PICC line terminates in the low SVC. Enteric tube appears to course beyond the diaphragm. Multilevel thoracic spine stabilization hardware is again seen. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are unchanged. There is apparent improvement in aeration of left lower lobe, although it is mostly obscured due to patient rotation. Mild interstitial edema is stable.
