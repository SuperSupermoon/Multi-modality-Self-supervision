IMPRESSION Orogastric tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, the distal end is beyond the radiograph view. An epidural catheter ends approximately at the level of mid thorax. Lung volumes are low. Increased retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung atelectasis and right infrahilar opacity suggesting mild right lung base atelectasis are unchanged since prior studies. There are no new lung opacities of concern. Top normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
