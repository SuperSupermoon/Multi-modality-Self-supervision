Possible small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. Left base opacity appears increased as compared the prior study and could be due to worsening consolidation, atelectasis, or combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. While left mid lung opacity may be slightly improved compared the prior study, there appears to be increased opacity in the right perihilar/ right mid lung which could be due to worsening infection or vascular congestion. Consider dedicated PA and lateral views for further assessment.
