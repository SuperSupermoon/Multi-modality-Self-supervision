No appreciable left pleural effusion or pneumothorax, pigtail pleural drain still in place along the lateral chest wall. Persistent left basal consolidation could be atelectasis but is concerning for possible pneumonia. Opacification at both lung bases is probably in part dependent edema. Small right pleural effusion is likely. Heart size normal. Right central venous infusion catheter ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
