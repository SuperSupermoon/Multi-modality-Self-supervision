Single upright portable frontal image of the chest. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is again noted. Pneumomediastinum is similar to prior exam. There has been interval decrease in the right apical pneumothorax. An opacity is again seen in the middle lobe area, likely related to known right middle lobe collapse. The lungs are otherwise clear. No large pleural effusion is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from prior exam.
