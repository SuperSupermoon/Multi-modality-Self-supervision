Endotracheal tube is in place, projecting 3.3 cm cranial to the carina in standard position. Lung volumes are extremely low, with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, exaggerating the cardiac silhouette and the pulmonary vasculature. There is associated compressive atelectasis, underlying aspiration not excluded. The lungs appear otherwise clear. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax. An NG tube passes into the stomach out of field of imaging.
