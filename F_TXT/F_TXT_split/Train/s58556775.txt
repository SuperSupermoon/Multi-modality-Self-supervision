Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carina. The pacemaker leads are in unchanged position. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged, but again the assessment of the heart is impossible due to bilateral pleural effusions overlying the cardiac border. The effusions are at least moderate associated with bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
