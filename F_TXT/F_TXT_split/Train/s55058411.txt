Again seen is a right subclavian PICC line, tip over distal SVC. Allowing for technical differences, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. The previously identified nodular densities are less pronounced than on the prior study, though faint residua are visible. Bibasilar opacities -- ? atelectasis -- prior again seen, last pronounced. No new nodular density, frank consolidation, or effusion is identified. Probable tiny calcified granuloma adjacent to the lower right trachea, unchanged.
