The heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion. There is persistent mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax appreciated. Patchy bibasilar opacity is likely related to the pulmonary edema, although atelectasis or an infectious process should also be considered. No large effusions.
