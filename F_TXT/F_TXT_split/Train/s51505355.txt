A right pectoral pacemaker sends leads to the right atrium and right ventricle. Two right-sided chest tubes, a right midline catheter, the left IJ central venous line, ET tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. There is no pneumothorax. Slightly increased opacification at the left base is most likely due to atelectasis. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits despite the projection.
