AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Hyperinflated right lung is good evidence for COPD, either small airway obstruction or emphysema or both. The relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is presumably eventration. Lungs are grossly clear. There is no pleural effusion. Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.
