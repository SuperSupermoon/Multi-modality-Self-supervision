In comparison with the study of ___, there is no evidence of mediastinal widening or significant change. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there is evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure as well as increased opacification in the retrocardiac area with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and possible small effusion. Central catheter tip remains in the lower SVC close to the level of the cavoatrial junction.
