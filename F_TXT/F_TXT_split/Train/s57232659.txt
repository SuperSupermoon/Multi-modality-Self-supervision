An 8 mm right upper lung nodule is again identified. A rounded 3.8 cm opacity at the left hemidiaphragm could represent diaphragm eventration or pleural/parenchymal nodule. Right PICC line remains unchanged in the mid SVC. Lung parenchyma is unchanged from prior. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Left costophrenic angle blunting stable since ___, likely represents pleural thickening rather than pleural fluid.
