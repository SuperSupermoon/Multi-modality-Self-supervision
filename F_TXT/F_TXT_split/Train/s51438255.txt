AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day with patient in supine position. Again, there is significant cardiac enlargement in this patient with a permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position and a single intracavitary electrode terminating in a position compatible with apical portion of right ventricle. There is significant cardiac enlargement as before. The configuration includes a prominence of the left atrial appendage contour resulting in a straightening of the left heart border rather typical for left atrial enlargement. Pulmonary vasculature is still congested but less so than on the preceding supine examination. On this image obtained with patient in upright position, there is no evidence of significant pleural effusion accumulating in the lateral pleural sinuses. No new acute parenchymal infiltrates can be seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.
