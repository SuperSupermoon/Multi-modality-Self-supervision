Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates the tracheostomy tube in stable satisfactory position. A right PICC is unchanged ending in the mid SVC. Consolidation in the left lower lobe persists with increased heterogeneous parenchymal opacities in the right lobe distant with multifocal pneumonia. Lung volumes remain low with likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
