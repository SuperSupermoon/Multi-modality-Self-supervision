Single semi-upright AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient's overlying chin partially obscures the right apex. There has been interval placement of a left-sided pigtail chest tube with interval decrease in patient's left pneumothorax, which is now small in size. Overlying left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is seen. There are low lung volumes. There is persistent left base opacity. Left subclavian central venous catheter is stable in position.
