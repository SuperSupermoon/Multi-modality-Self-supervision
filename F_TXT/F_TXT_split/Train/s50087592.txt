Patchy opacity at the right base would be concerning for pneumonia or aspiration, less likely atelectasis. Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema, large effusions or pneumothorax. Prominent dilated tortuous aorta raising the possibility of an aortic aneurysm. Heart is normal in size. Two faint 5 mm nodular opacities adjacent to the anterior right third rib could represent pulmonary nodules. Further imaging evaluation with dedicated chest CT or comparison to outside studies is recommended at this time.
