An apparent opacity overlying the left hemi thorax is due to a large hiatal hernia identified on the CT abdomen pelvis of the same date. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Bibasilar atelectasis is mild. The heart is mildly enlarged. Evaluation of the chest cage after trauma is not optimal on CT, but there are no apparent osseous abnormalities.
