Some of the apparent increase in heart size is due to differences in patient positioning. Cardiomegaly is mild to moderate. Low lung volumes exaggerate mild pulmonary edema, but increase in pulmonary vascular congestion in the upper lungs is easier to see. Bibasilar atelectasis is substantial and there may be small to moderate bilateral pleural effusion. Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
