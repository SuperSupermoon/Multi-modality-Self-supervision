Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates in the midtrachea 4.2 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen with the sidehole along the distal esophagus and can be advanced approximately 10 cm for optimal positioning. The lungs are well expanded and clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size with normal mediastinal contours. Calcified lesion in the upper abdomen corresponds to known calcified renal mass.
