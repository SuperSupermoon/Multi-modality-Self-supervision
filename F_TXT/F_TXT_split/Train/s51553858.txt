The endotracheal tube ends 7 cm above the carina in standard position. A right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. The NG tube is also in good position. The right chest tube could be fissural. There is no visible pneumothorax. The left lower lobe collapse and mild-to-moderate pleural effusion are stable. Less severe right base atelectasis has improved. Small pleural or extrapleural hematoma along right rib fractures and displacement of the right clavicle fracture are unchanged. The mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.
