A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends 3.5 cm above the carina. There is no large focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are within normal limits. No displaced rib fracture is seen. Biapical bullus emphysema is confirmed on the subsequent CT.
