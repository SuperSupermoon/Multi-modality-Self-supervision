Interval removal of bilateral chest tubes with unchanged small right apicolateral pneumothorax but slight decrease in size of small left apicolateral pneumothorax. Left PICC has changed in position, now making an abruptly angulated medial turn at the right tracheobronchial angle, most consistent with an abnormal course within the azygos vein. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema are again demonstrated, as well as worsening bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions. The PICC position has been communicated by phone to Dr. ___ at 4 p.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.
