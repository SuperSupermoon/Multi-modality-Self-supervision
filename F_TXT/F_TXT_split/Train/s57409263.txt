Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained. Nasogastric tube courses through the esophagus and into the stomach with tip in the distal body of the stomach. Left Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The lungs are well expanded and clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size with normal cardiomediastinal contours. Contrast is seen opacifying dilated loops of small bowel, incompletely assessed at the inferior aspect of the image.
