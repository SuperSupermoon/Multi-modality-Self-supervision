1. Endotracheal tube continues to lie 5.5 cm above the carina. There is a persistent opacification and consolidation at the left lung base which may represent an area of pneumonia, although it is possible that this could also reflect worsening lobar atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion as the pulmonary vasculature is now more ill defined consistent with superimposed pulmonary edema. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax is seen.
