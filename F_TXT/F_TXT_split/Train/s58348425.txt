Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There are persistent opacities in the bilateral bases, most likely atelectasis, but aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded. There has been interval improvement in the degree of interstitial pulmonary edema, which is now almost completely resolved. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. The superior mediastinum remains enlarged, likely secondary to tortuous vessels. Tracheostomy tube ends 4.3 cm from the carina. Note is made of multiple very dilated loops of bowel in the upper abdomen.
