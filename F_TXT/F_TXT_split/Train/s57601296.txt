Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Larger bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, unchanged allowing the difference in the positioning of the patient, are associated with adjacent consolidations. Right upper lobe consolidation has minimally improved. There is mild vascular congestion. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right IJ catheter sheath is in unchanged position.
