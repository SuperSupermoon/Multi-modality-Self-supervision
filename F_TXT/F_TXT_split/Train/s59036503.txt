As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal improvement of the parenchymal opacities at the left lung bases. On the right, the opacities have not substantially changed and tend to be more consolidated than on the previous image. Moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral basal atelectasis persists. The monitoring and support devices are constant. No larger pleural effusions.
