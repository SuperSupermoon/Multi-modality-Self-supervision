The lungs are well expanded. Bibasilar ill-defined opacities are present, more conspicuous in the right lower lung in a paramediastinal location, with mild peribronchovascular thickening in these areas. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable, allowing for slight high positioning of the aortic knob, unchanged, and probable scattered atherosclerotic calcification. Note is made of an old healed left posterior rib fracture and ? old healed right ___ rib fx. No obvious acute rib fxs detected on these lung technique films. A right-sided IJ line ends in the right atrium, approximately 5 cm below the cavoatrial junction.
