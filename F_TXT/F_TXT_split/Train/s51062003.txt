AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. During the interval, right-sided thoracocentesis was performed. The massive right-sided pleural density as identified on the previous examination has decreased moderately. Still the remaining pleural effusion obliterates totally the right-sided hemidiaphragm and reaches along the right-sided lateral chest wall. After the thoracocentesis, there is no evidence of any hydropneumothorax in the right hemithorax. Left-sided pulmonary changes which include a plate atelectasis in the left lung base remain unchanged. No new abnormalities are seen.
