In comparison to ___, there is worsening of the pleural effusion on the left, some of which may be loculated however CT would better make this diagnosis. The left PleurX catheter appears to curving downwards below the area of possible loculated pleural effusion if present; again, CT would be better to evaluate this. There is moderate effusion in the right side with volume loss in the right lower lobe, which may be worse than previous. Cardiac size cannot be fully assessed. No pneumothorax.
