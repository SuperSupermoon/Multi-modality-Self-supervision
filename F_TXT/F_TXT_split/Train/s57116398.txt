Single portable view of the chest was compared to CT scan from earlier the same day. Dense left basilar opacity is compatible with combination of left lower lobe collapse and parenchymal opacities in the left upper lobe. Left pneumothorax is demonstrated, both superiorly and at the lung base and along the mediastinum. Right lung is grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unremarkable, although shifted to the left. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
