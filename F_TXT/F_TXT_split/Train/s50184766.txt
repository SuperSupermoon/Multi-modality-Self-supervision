No previous images. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette though the pulmonary vessels on the left are within normal limits. On the right, there is hazy opacification that obscures the hemidiaphragm and is consistent with layering pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis. The vessels on this side appear engorged, consistent with asymmetric pulmonary edema. In view of the extensive changes on the right, in the appropriate clinical setting it would be impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
