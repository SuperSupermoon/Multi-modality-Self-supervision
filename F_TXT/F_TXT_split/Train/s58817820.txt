In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is no definite pneumothorax. Overlapping scapula somewhat obscures detail on the right. There is continued opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis and effusion and evidence of multiple old healed rib fractures. Somewhat low position of the endotracheal tube persists.
