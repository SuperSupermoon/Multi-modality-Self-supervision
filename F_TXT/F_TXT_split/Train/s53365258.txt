Heart size is difficult to discern given the presence of left basilar opacity which likely reflects a combination of small left pleural effusion with atelectasis or infection. The heart size is slightly increased, now appearing moderately enlarged. The aorta remains mildly tortuous. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. No right-sided pleural effusion is seen, and there is no pneumothorax. An osseous excrescence off of the left humeral head may be posttraumatic in etiology. There are no acute osseous abnormalities otherwise demonstrated.
