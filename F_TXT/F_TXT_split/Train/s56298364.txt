Compared to earlier the same day and allowing for differences in technique, the degree of opacification seen in both lungs appears to have progressed slightly, with more opacity now seen in the mid and upper zones on both sides. The possibility of some associated pleural fluid cannot be excluded, but much of this is likely accounted for by parenchymal opacification. The cardiac silhouette is now less well seen on both sides due to this opacification. The right paratracheal soft tissues are again noted to be prominent -- ? due to right-sided vascular engorgement. The ET tube lies approximately 5.3 cm above the carina and the right IJ central line overlies the distal SVC, both similar to the prior film.
