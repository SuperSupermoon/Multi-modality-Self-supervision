AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. Similar as on the preceding examination, there is almost a complete left-sided pulmonary whiteout in this patient who on recent chest CT showed large mass in left upper lobe area and almost complete atelectasis of left lower lobe. The right hemithorax demonstrates mostly well aerated pulmonary structures; however, in the apical area there is again evidence of a mass which also has been shown by CT. There is no evidence of new parenchymal infiltrate in comparison with yesterday's portable chest examination. For detail of pulmonary pathology, see CT chest report of ___.
