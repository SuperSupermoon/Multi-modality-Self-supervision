Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. There is interval development of mild interstitial edema. There is slight asymmetric increase in opacity in the right upper lobe, which could represent a superimposed consolidation/pneumonia. Mediastinal prominence could be due to portable AP technique. Bony structures are intact. Heart size appears grossly within normal limits. No large effusion is seen.
