The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with stable cardiac enlargement. There is possibly a small hiatal hernia. Overall, there is increasing opacity at the left base which is felt to more likely reflect an increasing left effusion, although airspace consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.

Prominent right hilum most likely reflects prominent vasculature suggesting underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension in the setting of known emphysema when correlated with a chest CT dated ___.
