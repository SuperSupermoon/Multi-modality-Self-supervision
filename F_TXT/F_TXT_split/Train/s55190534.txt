Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. Right IJ central venous catheter is seen with its tip in the mid SVC. Esophageal enteric catheter is seen with its tip in the region of the gastric body. Ovoid density projecting in the region of the gastric body likely represents enteric contrast from prior CT. There are low lung volumes bilaterally. There are bilateral pleural effusions, with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms bilaterally, likely reflecting bibasilar atelectasis/pneumonitis. No apical pneumothoraces are seen on this supine view. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is largely obscured by the low lung volumes.
