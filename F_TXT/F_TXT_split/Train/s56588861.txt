Interval decrease in size but residual small to moderate right pleural effusion status post thoracentesis. No pneumothorax. Heart remains stably enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Mediastinal contours are stable. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities at the left base and more focal patchy opacity at the right base likely reflect atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
