The endotracheal tube terminates 1.2 cm from the carina on the current study, though it has been repositioned on the followup examination and is in appropriate position. There is increasing density in the left lung base which may be due to developing pneumonia or an aspiration event. No pulmonary edema or large pleural effusion is identified. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits on this supine radiograph.
