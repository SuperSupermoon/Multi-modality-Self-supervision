Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. There was minimal blunting of the costophrenic angle suggestive of trace pleural effusions. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. There is mild pulmonary edema, minimally progressed since prior. Post-surgical changes related to the sternotomy wires and CABG are again noted. Multiple surgical clips are again seen projecting over right axilla. Partial imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
