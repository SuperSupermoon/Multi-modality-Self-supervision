Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There are layering effusions, left greater right. More patchy retrocardiac opacity most likely reflects compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. There is stable mild perihilar and interstitial edema. No pneumothorax.
