No previous images. In this patient with intact midline sternal wires related to previous CABG procedure, there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema. Hazy opacifications at the bases, more prominent on the right, are consistent with layering pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. However, there are also areas of more coalescent opacification, especially on the right. Although much of this could represent asymmetric pulmonary edema in a person lying on the right side, if there are appropriate symptoms this could well reflect regions of consolidation. The tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is coiled within the upper stomach.
