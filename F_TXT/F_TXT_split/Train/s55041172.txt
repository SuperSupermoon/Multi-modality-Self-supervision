Left jugular PICC line is unchanged and in standard position with tip ending at the mid SVC. The opacification of the lung bases is increased, especially at the right base, but without loss of volume. This is consistent with right lower lobe pneumonia. There is also an increased vascular congestion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
