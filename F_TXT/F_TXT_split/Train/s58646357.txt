In comparison with the study of ___, there again are bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the left, with underlying compressive basilar atelectasis. The configuration of the left effusion has change, so that empyema would be less likely radiographically. Air-fluid level at the right base is consistent with a small loculated region of hydro pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. In view of the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be impossible to exclude acute pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, an the absence of a lateral view.
