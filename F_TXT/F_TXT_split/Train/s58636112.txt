Lung volumes have decreased in the interim with associated bronchovascular crowding. Slight interval increase in retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms likely reflects atelectasis and/or vascular crowding in the setting of lower lung volumes. No pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly persists. Trace fluid in the center fissure is noted. Rounded opacity projecting just to the left of midline over the heart may be projectional. Nonspecific gaseous distension of bowel loops in the upper abdomen is noted. Mild dextroconvex scoliosis, unchanged.
