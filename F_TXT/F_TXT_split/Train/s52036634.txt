Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There are relatively low lung volumes. The patient is status post median sternotomy. Left base opacity is seen, which may be due to atelectasis; however, a small pleural effusion may be present, and a developing pneumonia is not excluded. There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and a trace right pleural effusion is not excluded there either. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Evidence of air seen under the right hemidiaphragm, presumed postoperative.
