In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the bilateral chest tubes remain in place. Again there are extremely low lung volumes that accentuate the prominence of the cardiac silhouette. The hemidiaphragms are more sharply seen, though this could merely represent a more erect position of the patient rather than clearing of the pleural fluid. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the bases. No evidence of pneumothorax. No abnormal gas in soft tissues in the region of the left chest tube insertion site.
