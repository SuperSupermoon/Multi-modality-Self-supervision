As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is noted. There is an improvement in ventilation of the lung bases, reflecting improved bilateral parenchymal opacities. A small opacity is still present at the right and left lung base as well as at the bases of the right upper lobe, substantially less severe than on the previous exam. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly. Status post CABG, the pacemaker wires and the central venous access device is constant in appearance.
