Single portable frontal image of the chest. ET tube is in adequate positions. NG tube passes into the stomach, but distal tip not included on the image. The lungs are well expanded. Bibasilar opacities are seen, likely representing atelectasis but cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
