AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging: Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the thoracic inlet, but the tube is angulated and the tip abuts the tracheal wall which may impede its function. No mediastinal widening, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. Heart is moderately enlarged. Lungs are grossly clear. Stomach is severely distended with air, presumably a function of intubation attempts.
