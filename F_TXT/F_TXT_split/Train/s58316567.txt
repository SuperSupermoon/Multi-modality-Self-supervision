Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Mild bibasilar opacities are noted, most likely consistent with atelectasis. No definite large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly indistinct with scattered regions of peribronchial cuffing, in the appropriate clinical context, could represent mild edema. No definite septal lines are identified.
