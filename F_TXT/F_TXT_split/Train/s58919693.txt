Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiac size is top normal. The aortic arch contour is better defined in the current study. There is persistent opacity in the right apex. As mentioned before, it should be evaluated with CT. ET tube is in standard position. The tip is 3.5 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. The left lung is grossly clear. Appearance of the right lung with some volume loss and elevation of the right hilum is unchanged. Ill-defined opacities in the right perihilar region are unchanged, of unclear etiology, could be due to infection or asymmetric edema. If any, there is a small right effusion. CT is again recommended for further evaluation.
