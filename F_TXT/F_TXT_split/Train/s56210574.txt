Study is slightly limited by underpenetrated technique. Heart size remains mildly to moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous with mild atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch. Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally is similar and suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. Retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis though infection is not completely excluded. Right lung is grossly clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
