The patient is after placement of a left pectoral pacemaker. The course of the lead is unremarkable, the tip of the lead projects over the right ventricle. There is no evidence of complications, notably no fracture or pneumothorax. Increased opacities at the right lung base might reflect atelectasis after the procedure and should receive attention on followups. No pleural effusions. No evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
