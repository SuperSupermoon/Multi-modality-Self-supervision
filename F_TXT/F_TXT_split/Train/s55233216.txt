AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-erect position. Comparison is made with a preceding pre-operative chest examination of ___. Normal heart size but markedly elongated and widened thoracic aorta as before. During the interval, the patient has undergone a right VATS procedure with wedge biopsy in the right lower lobe area. A right-sided chest tube has been introduced in the right lower chest wall and terminates in the apical area of the right hemithorax. No pneumothorax can be identified. In the area of the biopsy, a triangular-shaped well-demarcated local density is seen apparently representing the surgical intervention. No other pulmonary abnormalities are seen. Noted are relatively high-positioned diaphragms and poor inspirational efforts resulting in crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature. There is, however, no progression of significant pulmonary vascular congestion.
