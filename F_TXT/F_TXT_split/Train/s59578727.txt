As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a pigtail catheter inserted in the right pleural space. There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. The extent of the pre-existing pleural effusion on the right has decreased. The cardiac silhouette, the bilateral areas of partial lower lobe atelectasis and the known left pleural effusion are unchanged.
