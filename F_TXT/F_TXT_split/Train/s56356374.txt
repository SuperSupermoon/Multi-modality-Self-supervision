Patient is rotated slight to the left. The patient status post median sternotomy and CABG. There is persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Subtle right base opacity is seen which may be due to atelectasis, but a mild consolidation due to aspiration or infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation if patient able. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
