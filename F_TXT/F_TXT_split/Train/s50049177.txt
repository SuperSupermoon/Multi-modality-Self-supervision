In comparison with the study of ___, there is persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm without acute vascular congestion or pleural effusion. There is an area of increased opacification in the left perihilar region. In view of the clinical symptoms, this could conceivably represent a developing consolidation. There is also a small area of opacification in the right mid lung laterally that could be a consolidative focus. Little change in the position of the tip of the central catheter, which extends to lower portion of the SVC. Slight bending of the PICC catheter that could be merely positional.
