As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Extensive scarring in the lung parenchyma, with known bilateral pleural effusions and non-recent opacities in both lung apices and perihilar lung regions. In the longer followup, for example compared to ___, these opacities have the tendency to decrease in extent. The displaced right lateral rib fractures associated with pleural thickening, are constant in appearance. No new parenchymal opacity. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged course of the nasogastric tube.
