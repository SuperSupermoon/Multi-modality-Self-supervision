Patient has had interim median sternotomy and cervicothoracic incision. Mediastinal widening in the region of the aortic knob due to the ruptured left subclavian pseudoaneurysm is comparable to the preoperative appearance. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Heart size is normal and unchanged. New opacification in the left lower lung is presumably atelectasis. Right lung is very low in volume but essentially clear. ET tube in standard placement. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary artery.
