As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing signs indicative of pulmonary edema have increased. This is reflected by both an increase in vascular diameters and slight increase in peribronchial cuffing. New blunting of the left costophrenic sinus might reflect mild left pleural effusion. Areas of atelectasis at the lung bases are constant. The monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
