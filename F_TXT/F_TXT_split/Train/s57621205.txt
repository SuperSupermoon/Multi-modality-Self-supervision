There are increased interstitial markings with associated hilar fullness, consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Increased opacification at the medial right base and in the retrocardiac space is most likely due to edema, though an underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are normal. The heart is moderately enlarged.
