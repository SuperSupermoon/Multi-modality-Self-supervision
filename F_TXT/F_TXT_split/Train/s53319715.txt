AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right apical pneumothorax is noted, small unchaged since the prior CT torso (within the limitations of comparison between different modalities). Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. Bibasal atelectasis is noted. No appreciable pleural effusion is seen. Bilateral breast prostheses are noted.
