A tracheostomy tube is present with the tip in the proximal trachea approximately 8.5 cm from the carina. A right PICC is present with the tip in the mid SVC. Diffuse interstitial abnormalities are consistent with mild pulmonary edema. A more focal opacity at the right base is of uncertain etiology. There is likely a small right pleural effusion. No left pleural effusion is identified. The mediastinal contours are normal. The heart is moderately enlarged.
