1. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and left subclavian central line are unchanged in position. There are stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours in this patient status post a thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair. Overall, there is improving aeration in the left lung, although there is persistent retrocardiac opacity which may reflect lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is also patchy opacity persisting at the right base which may represent atelectasis, although an early infectious process cannot be excluded. Given overall interval improvement, this is felt to most likely reflect resolving mild pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pneumothorax. Small to moderate layering left effusion. No large right effusion is seen.
