A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph was obtained. The patient is rotated, limiting evaluation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions are likely unchanged, perhaps slightly worse on the left. No definite new focal consolidation is identified, although the right lower lobe opacity previously noted would be obscured by the patient's current positioning. The visualized upper abdomen is remarkable for a stent projecting over the right upper quadrant, unchanged compared to prior exam.
