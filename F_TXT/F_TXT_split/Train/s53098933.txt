An enteric catheter courses below the left hemidiaphragm and out of view. A Swan-Ganz catheter is likely positioned within the main pulmonary artery. An inferior, likely femoral approach, ECMO venous cannula terminates within the distal superior vena cava rather than right atrium. No definite arterial cannula is identified suggesting this is either ___ ___-___ ECMO technique or there is renal arterial ECMO access. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are not significantly changed compared to prior examination. There is stable if not slightly worsened pulmonary edema compared to ___, not an unexpected finding. However, there is a new retrocardiac opacification which may be due to a combination of edema, atelectasis and new small left pleural effusion.
