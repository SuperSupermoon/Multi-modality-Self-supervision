Supine portable AP view of the chest provided. The heart remains mildly enlarged. There is limited evaluation due to low lung volumes. Subtle left lower lung opacity is seen projecting behind the heart, which could represent early pneumonia. A lateral view would be helpful to confirm. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear without evidence of effusion or pneumothorax. The mediastinal contour is stable. Bony structures are intact.
