Assessment is limited by low lung volumes and kyphotic positioning. Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar with calcified mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes compatible with prior granulomatous disease. There is no overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, likely reflective of atelectasis. Calcified pleural plaque is again noted within the right lung base. Punctate calcified granuloma is seen in the right lung base. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. Mild to moderate degenerative changes and compression deformity of a mid/ low thoracic vertebral body are again seen in the thoracic spine. Remote right-sided rib fractures are re- demonstrated.
