In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside facility, there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with suggestion of some central pulmonary vascular congestion. The hemidiaphragms are not well seen, raising the possibility of a small pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. In the left mid to lower zone, there is a suggestion of a somewhat ill-defined area of increased opacification. This could possibly represent a pulmonary nodule. Extensive posttraumatic changes are seen in the right ribs as well as dislocation about the right shoulder joint.
