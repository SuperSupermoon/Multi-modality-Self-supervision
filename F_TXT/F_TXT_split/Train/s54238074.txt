AP chest compared to ___: Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions have improved. Left lower lobe remains largely airless, and cardiac silhouette is still severely enlarged. Right PIC line ends in the upper mediastinum, probably but not definitely in the SVC. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are in standard placements. No pneumothorax.
