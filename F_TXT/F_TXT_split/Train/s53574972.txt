There is markedly improved aeration of the right lower lung with persistent right mid lung consolidation, consistent with pneumonia, as seen on CT. Large right basilar pneumothorax is present. Mild left lower lung consolidation is slightly improved. New density tracking along the right apex likely represents pleural fluid or blood. A right chest tube coursing to the apex is again seen. There has been interval placement of 2 additional right-sided chest tubes. Right Port-A-Cath appears similarly positioned. No left pleural effusion is seen. Right hilar clips likely reflect prior surgery.
