AP chest compared to ___, most recently 2:29 p.m.: Lung volumes remain quite low with most severe atelectasis at the base in both lower lungs, slightly worse today on the left than it was yesterday. There has been some improvement in mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but there is no pulmonary edema. Heart size is top normal. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. Upper alimentary tube can be traced only as far as the gastroesophageal junction, but the tip is not visible.
