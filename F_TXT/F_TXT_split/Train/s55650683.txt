The tracheostomy tube is in standard position. There is a right-sided PICC line with the tip terminating in the mid SVC. The enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip beyond the scope of the film. Again, multiple calcified pleural plaques overlie the lungs with unchanged pleural thickening. There has been interval improvement of the left retrocardiac opacity compared to the exam performed earlier this morning, consistent with improving atelectasis. Non-specific opacity at the right lung base is unchanged. No new focal consolidations are seen. The small bilateral pleural effusions are stable. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding. The hilar and mediastinal contours are otherwise normal. There is no subdiaphragmatic free air.
