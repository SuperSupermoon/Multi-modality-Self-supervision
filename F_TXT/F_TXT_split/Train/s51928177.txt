The appearance is very similar to the prior examination with marked lobular circumferential pleural thickening in the right hemithorax. Aeration of the right lung appears perhaps mildly decreased, probably corresponding to increased volume loss, although a superimposed process or rapid progression of disease may explain the small change. The left lung remains clear.
