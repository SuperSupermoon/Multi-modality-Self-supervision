AP chest radiograph. As compared to the prior study, the intra-aortic balloon pump appears to be still relatively high, minimally lower than the aortic knob and should be pulled back for at least 1 more centimeter. The Swan-Ganz catheter is unchanged in position with its tip in the right interlobar pulmonary artery. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Lungs are essentially clear. Right basal opacity appears to be improved, although still present.
