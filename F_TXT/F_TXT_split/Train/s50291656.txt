An endotracheal tube has been advanced. It now terminates about 6.5 cm above the carina. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is persistent volume loss with partial collapse of the right upper lobe, but with some degree of re-expansion since the recent prior examination. The left lung remains clear. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
