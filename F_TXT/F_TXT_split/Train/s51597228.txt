AP chest compared to ___ and ___ at 8:13 a.m.: Course of the left PICC line is not standard. Although it ends over the head of the left clavicle, it has been withdrawn from more medial positioning, it is higher than expected and may be in a small vein rather than a central one. Determining precise localization would require either fluoroscopic venogram or CT scanning if it is not possible to confirm its location clinically. Normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum and pleural surfaces.
