AP chest compared to ___: Tip of the endotracheal tube is 6 cm or more from the carina. The chin is in neutral or elevated position. Since more flexion of the head and neck is unlikely, the tube could be advanced another 2 cm for a more secured seating. Based on the limitations of bedside radiographic technique of the patient of this size, I can say there is probably pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement and moderate cardiomegaly, and in comparison to ___, conceivably mild interstitial edema, unless of course there are posteriorly layering pleural effusions, which would simulate edema. There is no pneumothorax. A feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
