Single portable view of the chest. No prior. Endotracheal tube is seen with tip approximately 4.5 cm from the carina. Right lung is grossly clear. Left lung is obscured by overlying trauma board and clips. Increased lucency at the left lung base bilaterally is suggestive of a pneumothorax, better seen on CT performed subsequently. Multiple location left-sided rib fractures are also better characterized on CT scan. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
