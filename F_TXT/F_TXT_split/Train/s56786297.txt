Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a right PICC line terminates in the low SVC, unchanged from previous imaging. There is no pneumothorax or other complications. Interval removal of NG tube is also noted. There is a left pleural effusion and opacity in the left lower lobe associated with some volume loss. A catheter is seen overlying the liver. Calcified left hilar lymph nodes are again noted. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear and well expanded. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
