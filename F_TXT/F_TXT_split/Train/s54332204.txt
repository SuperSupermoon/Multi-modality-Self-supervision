An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.1 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip and side-port extending beneath diaphragm. Tip extends beyond the edge of the film. A right IJ central line is present, tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. There are low inspiratory volumes. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Again seen is dense retrocardiac opacity obscuration left hemidiaphragm, consistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Small left effusion is likely present. There is patchy opacity at the right base, similar to the prior film, with trace blunting of the costophrenic angle. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. No free air detected beneath the diaphragms on this supine film.
