In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes with bibasilar opacification, especially on the left, consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. Vague area of increased opacification at the left base medially could possibly represent a region of developing consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting.
