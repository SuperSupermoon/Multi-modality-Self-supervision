Single portable view of the chest. NG tube is seen with tip past the GE junction although side port is likely in the distal esophagus and should be advanced for optimal positioning. There is new right basilar opacity not seen on prior. Less conspicuous retrocardiac opacity is also seen but similar to prior. Superiorly the lungs are notable for biapical calcified likely pleural based scarring. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Dual lead pacing device again noted.
