There is a new left-sided chest tube with interval decrease in the left pleural effusion which is still moderate in size. There has been some interval partial improved aeration of the left lower lobe however volume loss is still present in that region. There is a small amount of volume loss the right lobe but overall the aeration is better than on the prior study. There continues to be vascular redistribution compatible with mild fluid overload
