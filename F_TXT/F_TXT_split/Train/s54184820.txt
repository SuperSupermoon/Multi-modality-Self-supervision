The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. A discrete nodular focus projects inferior to the left hilum near the left cardiac border. It may represent a normal vascular structure but at least raises some concern for a nodule. When clinically appropriate, repeat views with standard PA and lateral technique are recommended to assess further.
