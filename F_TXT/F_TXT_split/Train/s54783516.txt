Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The side hole of a new right pleural tube is positioned outside of the pleural cavity. The tip of a second linear body immediately inferior to this pleural tube is not visualized. Heterogeneous opacity overlying the right lung base is likely a combination of small effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Indistinct left costophrenic angle and retrocardiac opacity is consistent with a small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Mild cardiomegaly and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
