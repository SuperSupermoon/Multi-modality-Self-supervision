A left PICC line is seen malpositioned, unchanged from the prior radiograph with the tip most likely in the right brachiocephalic vein. There is otherwise no significant change from the prior study. Left basilar atelectasis is stable, and there are clips seen at the expected location of the GE junction. There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
