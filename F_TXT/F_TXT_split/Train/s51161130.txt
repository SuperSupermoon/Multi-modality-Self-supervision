As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in constant position. The lung parenchyma is minimally increased in the transparency, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, probably caused by a small left pleural effusion, persists in unchanged extent. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
