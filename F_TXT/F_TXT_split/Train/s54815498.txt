Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Right subclavian line tip is at the level of low SVC. The heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. Left basal consolidation has increased as well as there is slight interval increase in pleural effusion. Findings most likely consistent with atelectasis, but attention to this area to exclude the possibility of pulmonary edema is required. On the right, there is questionable minimal amount of apical pneumothorax, not substantially different from the prior study. The right chest tube is in place.
