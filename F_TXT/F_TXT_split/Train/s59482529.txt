AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes remain low, heart moderately enlarged, mediastinal veins dilated, and pulmonary vasculature only minimally engorged. Given the low lung volumes, it is very hard to determine if mild pulmonary edema is present, but there is enough vascular distention and new right pleural effusion since 9:40 a.m. on ___ to suggest at least some cardiac decompensation. ET tube is in standard position. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax.
