Overall, there is little interval change in comparison to the prior study. Endotracheal tube appears in place in mid-trachea. Right internal jugular central venous catheter appears in place with the tip at the lower SVC. Enteric tube traverses to the stomach. Again noted is persistent left lower lobe collapse and adjacent small to moderate pleural effusion. Right basilar opacities are also again noted and likely represent a combination of small pleural effusion and atelectasis. Right middle lobe opacities which may be representative of atelectasis versus pneumonia appear stable. Previously noted mild pulmonary edema appears improved at the apices.
