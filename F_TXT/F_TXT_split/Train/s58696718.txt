No relevant change as compared to the previous image. Decreased lung volumes cause slightly more atelectasis at the lung bases. However, there is no evidence of an increasing parenchymal abnormality, making the presence of pneumonia unlikely. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions.
