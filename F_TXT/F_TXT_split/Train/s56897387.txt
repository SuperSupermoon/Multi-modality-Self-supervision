In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. There has been substantial aeration of the left mid and upper zones with residual opacification at the bases consistent with some combination of pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Pleural effusion and volume loss at the right lower lobe lung is again seen.
