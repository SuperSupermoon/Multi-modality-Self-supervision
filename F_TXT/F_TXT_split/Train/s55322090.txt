There is an interval placement of the nasogastric tube with the tip terminating in the expected location of the gastric antrum. The right-sided PICC line terminates in the mid SVC. The low lung volumes are low. The right costophrenic angle is excluded in this study. There is interval increased of veil-like opacity in the right hemithorax, likely representing layering of enlarging moderate right-sided pleural effusion. The left lung remains clear. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains mildly prominent.
