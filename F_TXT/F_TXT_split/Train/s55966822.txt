Compared to prior radiograph from 1 day earlier, mediastinal drains and chest tubes have been removed. The very small right apical pneumothorax and minimal left apical pneumothorax both appear smaller compared to the prior radiograph. Exam is otherwise remarkable for bibasilar atelectasis, with interval worsening on the left, and persistent small to moderate left pleural effusion.
