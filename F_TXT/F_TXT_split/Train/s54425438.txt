The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Volume loss with traction bronchiectasis and calcified granulomas in the left upper lobe are unchanged, with the remainder of the lungs appearing clear. No focal consolidation is seen. Lungs are hyperinflated suggestive of underlying COPD. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
