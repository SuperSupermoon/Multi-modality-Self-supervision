Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is stable. Smaller right pleural effusion has decreased. Mediastinal vascular distention has improved, but the contour of the periaortic hemiatoma widening the left upper mediastinum is unchanged. ET tube in standard placement. Right jugular line ends in the SVC and a nasogastric tube ends in the mid stomach. No pneumothorax.
