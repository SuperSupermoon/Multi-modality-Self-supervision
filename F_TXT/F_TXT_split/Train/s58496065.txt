Interval placement of bilateral pigtail pleural catheters with decrease in size of the pleural effusions and overall improved aeration of the lungs, particularly at the bases.

Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits given portable technique. Left internal jugular central line and left subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position.
