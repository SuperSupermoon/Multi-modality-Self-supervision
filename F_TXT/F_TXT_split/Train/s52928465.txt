1) Possible slight worsening of opacity at the right lung base. 2) Vertical opacities along the right lung most likely represent artifact due to skin folds. If clinically indicated, a repeat view with less rotation and attention to potential skin fold could help for additional assessment of the right lung. 3) Otherwise, allowing for positioning, I doubt significant interval change. 4) Some plethora at the left lung apex is similar to the prior film. Otherwise, no definite increase in CHF findings.
