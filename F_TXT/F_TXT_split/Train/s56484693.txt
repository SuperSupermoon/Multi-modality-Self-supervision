Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with slight interval improvement of widespread pulmonary opacification, most notable in the right lung. Persistent opacification of the left lower lung represents a combination of pleural effusion and consolidation. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. ET tube is 3 cm above the carina. Right-sided central venous line ends in the distal SVC. Nasogastric tube is in the stomach and off the image. No pneumothorax.
