Since the chest radiograph obtained approximately 7 hours prior, there has been interval improvement in the large, now moderate, right pleural effusion and an interval increase in pulmonary edema, most evident looking at the left lung fields. Moderate left pleural effusion unchanged. Heart size and cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged. Interval placement of NG right-sided PICC, which terminates in the lower SVC. The ET tube terminates 6 cm above the carina. Enteric tube is in the stomach and terminates outside the field of view.
