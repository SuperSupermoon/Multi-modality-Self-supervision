Small region of opacity at the apex of the right lung is presumably resection artifact. Right upper thoracic pleural drain in place. There may be a very small right pleural air collection medial to the lower part of the pleural drain. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall is commonly seen after Chest surgery. Extensive left-sided pleural thickening and scarring are presumably post traumatic given the presence of multiple healed left rib fractures. Heart size normal.
