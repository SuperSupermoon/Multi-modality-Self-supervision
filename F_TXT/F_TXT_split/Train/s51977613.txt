Mild cardiomegaly unchanged. Borderline pulmonary vascular engorgement persists. New septal lines are seen in the lower lungs, probably mild edema. Pleural effusion is minimal if any. Widening of the upper mediastinum and mild narrowing of the trachea at the thoracic inlet could be due to fat deposition and/or a large goiter.
