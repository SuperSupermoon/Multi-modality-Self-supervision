An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position approximately 5 cm from the carina. Opacification of the left base is likely due to layering fluid from a moderate left pleural effusion, as well as atelectasis. There is a small right pleural effusion. No focal opacity is identified to suggest pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. Sternal wires are intact, consistent with a prior CABG. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
