Right sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour is likely due to low lung volumes. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, however infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Large hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated.
