Evaluation is limited by overlying trauma backboard. Endotracheal tube is visualized with the tip in the mid trachea. An enteric tube is visualized with the tip coiled within the stomach. The lungs are hypoinflated which exaggerate the pulmonary vascular markings. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no pneumothorax or focal consolidation.
