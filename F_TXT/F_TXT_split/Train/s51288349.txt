The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, consistent with known pericardial effusion. There is a pericardial drain overlying the heart. Known left upper lobe spiculated mass, seen on outside chest CT, cannot be visualized on this examination. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is related to a small pleural effusion. There is mild atelectasis at the right lung base. The right lung is otherwise clear.
