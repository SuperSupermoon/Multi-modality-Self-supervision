Subsegmental atelectasis projects over the diaphragmatic region of the left chest, making it impossible to exclude pneumoperitoneum, but this is probably the splenic flexure. Repeat upright radiograph is recommended, when feasible. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
