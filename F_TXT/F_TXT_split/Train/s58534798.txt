An ET tube is present --___ tip lies in satisfactory position approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present --___ tip overlies the gastric fundus. A left subclavian central line is present --___ tip lies at the expected site of confluence with the proximal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. There is background hyperinflation suggestive of COPD. There is probable mild cardiomegaly, not significantly changed. There is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is probable left-sided volume loss, as the cardiomediastinal silhouette is shifted to the left. There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. There is atelectasis at the right lung base. Possibility of changes due to aspiration would be difficult to exclude in this setting. No gross effusion. No pneumothorax detected. Density seen in the left upper zone are probably related to overlying materials.
