Again low lung volumes contribute to bibasilar opacities which could be atelectasis, but certainly pneumonia should be considered. Right IJ line terminates in the low SVC. No pneumothorax. Median sternotomy wires, mediastinal clips, and cardiac silhouette are all stable. Possible small bilateral pleural effusions may be present. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures persists, and mild pulmonary vascular engorgement may be present. Patient is status post CABG and median sternotomy.
