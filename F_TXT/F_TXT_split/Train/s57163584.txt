Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Leads of a left chest wall pacer terminate in the right atrium and ventricle. Lung volumes are decreased, exaggerating heart size, which appears mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are otherwise stable. Pulmonary edema has increased since the prior exam with small bilateral pleural effusions. Increased retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis or aspiration. No pneumothorax.
