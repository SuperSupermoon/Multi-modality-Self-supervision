An endotracheal tube and right upper central venous line are in unchanged position. An extremely large hiatal hernia continues to cause rightward shift of the mediastinum. Tip of the nasoenteric catheter is above the left hemidiaphragm within the hernia sac. Apparent widening of the mediastinum is similar to prior and likely due to a combination of mediastinal shift and patient rotation. Opacity within the right medial lung base has slightly progressed and is likely due to progressive middle lobe atelectasis. Increasing right pleural effusion is likely, now moderate. A small left pleural effusion persists. Left lower lobe atelectasis is also likely. Upper lungs remain clear.
