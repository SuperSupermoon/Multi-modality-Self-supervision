A new enteric tube has been place with tip relying the distal stomach. ET tube is seen in standard position. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with mild cardiomegaly. Opacification at the right lung base may perhaps be slightly improved compared to the prior study, indicating perhaps lessened volume loss and decreased pleural effusion at the left base. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.
