Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest and upper abdomen demonstrates that the nasogastric tube courses into the stomach, loops on itself, and terminates in the cardiac fundus. The lung apices are not imaged. Aside from minimal left basilar atelectasis, the imaged lung fields are clear. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion and no large pneumothorax, although assessment is limited by the lack of coverage of the apices. Pulmonary vascular markings are normal. There is residual contrast within the colon. Multiple healed bilateral rib fractures are redemonstrated.
