Left pleural basilar pigtail catheter remains in place. No definite pneumothorax is seen. There is persistent retrocardiac opacity with an associated layering effusion likely reflecting lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Faint opacity at the right base appears somewhat improved suggestive of resolving atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. No pulmonary edema. Stable cardiac enlargement.
