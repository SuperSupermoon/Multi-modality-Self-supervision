Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate interval removal of the left-sided PICC line. There is no pneumothorax or other complication seen. The left IJ central catheter remains in unchanged position. There is significant volume loss on the left side again noted. A significant right-sided pleural effusion is again seen, unchanged from previous imaging. A left-sided pleural effusion may also be present. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by the pleural effusion and lung volume loss.
