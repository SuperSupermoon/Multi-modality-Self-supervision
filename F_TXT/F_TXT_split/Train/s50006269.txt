Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, likely secondary to poor inspiration. There is asymmetric, right greater than left, diffuse opacification of the lungs which is consistent in appearance with vascular congestion and pulmonary edema, though in the appropriate clinical context pneumonia cannot be completely excluded. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiomegaly is again seen.
