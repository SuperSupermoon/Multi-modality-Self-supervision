PA and lateral views of the chest were provided. There is poorly defined airspace consolidation in the left lower lung which is concerning for pneumonia. The right lung appears essentially clear. No large effusions or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. There is a nodular opacity projecting over the head of the right clavicle, which could represent superimposed overlapping structures, though a true nodule would be difficult to exclude. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
