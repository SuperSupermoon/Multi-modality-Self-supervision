Lung volumes remain low with persistent linear left basilar atelectasis. There is new airspace opacity in the left mid and lower lung. There are background changes of mild congestive heart failure however the appearances are suspicious for infection given the asymmetry. Alternatively, this could represent asymmetric pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion seen. No pneumothorax.
