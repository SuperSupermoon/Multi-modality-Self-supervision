Assessment is limited due to low lung volumes and significant artifact from trauma board. Allowing for this limitation, the endotracheal tube is seen ending approximately 4 cm above the carina and the esophageal tube ends below the gastroesophageal junction, with the tip out of view. Low lung volumes accounting for bronchovascular crowding. No cardiomegaly is identified. Apparent widening of the vascular pedicle is likely due to position and low lung volumes.
