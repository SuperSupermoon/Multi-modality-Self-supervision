Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The right internal jugular line has been placed with its tip being at the level of mid SVC with no evidence of post-insertion pneumothorax. Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged. Left retrocardiac opacity and right basilar opacity are unchanged, but there is slight interval improvement in pulmonary edema.
