Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. There is mild central pulmonary vascular congestion. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no evidence of a large pleural effusion although a small left pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude due to overlying soft tissue. No pneumothorax is seen.
