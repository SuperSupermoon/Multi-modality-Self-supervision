Tracheostomy tube has been replaced. The new tube is shorter and smaller than the previous one but the tip is midline. There are no mediastinal changes to suggest complications. Lungs are low in volume but clear and there is no pleural abnormality. Moderate cardiomegaly stable. Left PIC line can be traced as far as the upper right atrium, but the tip is obscured by an EKG lead.
