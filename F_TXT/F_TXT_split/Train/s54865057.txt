Interval removal of feeding tube. Central venous catheter unchanged in position. Stable cardiomediastinal contours. Lung volumes remain low, with slight improvement in bilateral heterogeneous lung opacities, with residual reticular and ground-glass opacities remaining, possibly due to pulmonary edema, but followup radiographs would be helpful to document resolution and to exclude other causes of interstitial lung disease. Small right pleural effusion has decreased in size with adjacent improving area of atelectasis. Possible new small left pleural effusion.
