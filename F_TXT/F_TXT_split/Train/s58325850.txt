AP upright chest radiograph obtained. A metallic clip at the right medial lower lung resides within a known pulmonary nodule. There is a retrocardiac opacity, compatible with large hiatal hernia. Compared with the prior chest radiograph, there is interval development of micronodular opacity within the right lower lung which could reflect treatment-related change or possibly aspiration. Otherwise, the lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures appear intact.
