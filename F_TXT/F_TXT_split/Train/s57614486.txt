In comparison with study of ___, the patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration. Opacification in the right mid and lower zones is again seen, though the increased inspiration makes it less coalescent than on the previous study. Atelectatic changes are again seen at the left base and there is continued blunting of both costophrenic angles. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
