Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given marked patient rotation, but are likely stable. Lungs remain low lung volumes with overall improvement in aeration, suggesting that interstitial edema has resolved. Basilar patchy opacities are unchanged and may reflect chronic changes. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity for detecting pneumothorax is somewhat diminished given supine technique.
