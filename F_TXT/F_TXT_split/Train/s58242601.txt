An endotracheal tube has been placed, terminating 2 cm above the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip in the left upper quadrant, likely within the stomach. The inspiratory lung volumes are low with resultant bronchovascular crowding. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacification most likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
