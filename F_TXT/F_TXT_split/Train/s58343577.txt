Swan-Ganz catheter has been placed via a right internal jugular approach, and terminates in the interlobar portion of the right pulmonary artery. It could be withdrawn approximately 3 cm to terminate more centrally in the right hilar region. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance with prominent main pulmonary artery contour, likely due to provided history of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Mild interstitial edema is present within the lungs. Previously reported basilar lung opacities have improved.
