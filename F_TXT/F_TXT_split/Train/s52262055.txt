An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present and extends beneath the diaphragm, off film. Compared to ___ and allowing for technical differences, a small portion of the left hemidiaphragm is now visible, suggesting a degree of interval improvement. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
