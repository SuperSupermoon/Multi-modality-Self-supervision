Please note that the extreme lung apices are excluded from the field of view, and the right costophrenic angle is obscured by the patient's hand projecting over this area. Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. Punctate calcified granuloma is noted in the right lung base. No displaced fractures are evident.
