Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and worsening diffuse airspace opacities throughout the right lung. Although potentially due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema, considering history of interval thoracentesis, pneumonia should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Within the left lung, left perihilar haziness has improved, and may have been due to pulmonary edema. Left retrocardiac opacity is minimally improved, and small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions are persistent.
