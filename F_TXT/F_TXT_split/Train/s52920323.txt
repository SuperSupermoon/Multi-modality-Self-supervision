The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. There is unchanged double contour to the right hemidiaphragm. Although difficult to completely exclude, there are no definite pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacity has improved. Right basilar opacity has also improved. There is mild coarsening of lung markings, but not necessarily an acute finding. Patchy left mid lung opacities suggest residual atelectasis. The patient is status post incompletely characterized cervical fusion. The patient is also status post right shoulder replacement.
