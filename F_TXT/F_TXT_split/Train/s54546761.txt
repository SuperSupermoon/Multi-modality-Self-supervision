Heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities are noted obscuring the hemidiaphragms bilaterally. There appears to be a small right pleural effusion. Assessment for a left pleural effusion is limited as the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. No large left pleural effusion is demonstrated. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
