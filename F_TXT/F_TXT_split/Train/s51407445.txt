Left Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified on the current study. Worsening bilateral airspace disease more likely representing moderate pulmonary edema, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Followup imaging after diuresis may be helpful. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient rotation. No obvious pneumothorax.
