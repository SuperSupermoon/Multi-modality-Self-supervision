Since the prior study, the patient has been intubated, with the endotracheal tube terminating 4.9 cm above the carina. There are persistent signs of mild decompensated congestive heart failure but atelectasis at the left lung base has improved with mechanical ventilation. The size of the effusion is likely unchanged and appears more diffuse due to supine positioning.
