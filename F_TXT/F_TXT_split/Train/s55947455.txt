As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new right internal jugular vein catheter. The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip of the catheter projects over the mid SVC. The parenchymal opacities that pre-existed, notably at the right lung base, are more severe and extensive in distribution. Unchanged mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. The presence of small pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
