Compared to the prior film, the overall appearance is similar. Again seen is the tracheostomy. Heart size is probably unchanged. Patchy density the left base consistent with collapse and/or consolidation is again noted, overall similar. The possibility of a small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. The right lung and costophrenic sulcus are grossly clear. No overt CHF. Balloon related to G tube noted. Old healed right clavicular fracture again noted.
