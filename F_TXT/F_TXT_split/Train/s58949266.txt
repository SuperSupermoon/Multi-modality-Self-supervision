1. Right internal jugular Port-A-Cath, left internal jugular central line, nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube are unchanged in position. 2. Interval improvement in aeration throughout both lungs with persistent bilateral airspace process suggesting resolving pulmonary edema. There is persistent retrocardiac consolidation which may represent partial lower lobe atelectasis. There are likely layering bilateral effusions. Given the interval change, a diffuse infectious process or ARDS would be less likely. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No evidence of pneumothorax.
