Lungs are clear. No pleural abnormality. No progression of preexisting mediastinal widening. Of note, continued severe dilatation azygos vein, usually an indication of elevated central venous and/or right heart pressure, and persistent moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. On yesterday's chest CTA right atrium and ventricle were dilated, left ventricle was small with a thin wall and there was at least a small pericardial effusion. Echocardiographic follow-up is recommended.
