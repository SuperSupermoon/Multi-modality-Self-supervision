There is moderate interstitial pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Aortic calcifications are seen. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the region of the cavoatrial junction. Multiple nodular opacities, largest projecting over the right lung field, may represent metastases and should be further evaluated with CT.
