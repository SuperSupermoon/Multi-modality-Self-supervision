Compared to the prior study, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen are left-sided pacemaker, with lead tips over the right atrium right ventricle. There are low inspiratory volumes. The enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Opacification at both lung bases with obscuration of both hemidiaphragms is unchanged. Band of density in the left mid zone, extending cephalad towards left chest wall is also unchanged. Vascular plethora, compatible with CHF, is also grossly unchanged.
