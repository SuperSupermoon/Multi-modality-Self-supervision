Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. A suspected vessel coursing towards the right lower lobe is prominent. Linear opacities in the right greater than left lung bases could be due to atelectasis or scarring. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Multiple surgical clips overlie the superior mediastinum in the midline, unable to be definitively localized without a lateral view.
