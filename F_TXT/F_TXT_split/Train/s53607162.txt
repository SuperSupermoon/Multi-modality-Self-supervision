Since prior, there has been interval placement of a right-sided pleural pigtail catheter. There is some persistent component of pneumothorax seen inferolaterally. The patient is now positioned more optimally without significant rotation, and the mediastinum is in expected location. There is some right basilar opacity seen medially, potentially atelectasis; however, continued followup is suggested especially given history of patient's lung cancer. Surgical chain sutures again seen in the left paramediastinal region. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
