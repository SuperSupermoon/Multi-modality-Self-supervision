The lung volumes are low. Hazy opacities overly the lower lung fields bilaterally possibly representing a combination of effusion and consolidation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. The ET tube terminates 4 cm from the carina. The NG tube is seen below the diaphragm but the tip is beyond the imaged field.
