AP chest compared to ___: Tip of the new endotracheal tube is in standard position. New nasogastric tube is looped in the upper portion of a non-distended stomach. Lung volumes are quite low but unchanged. There is moderate degree of atelectasis at the left lung base. The high diaphragm due in part to splenomegaly, exaggerates heart size which is probably mildly enlarged. Mediastinal vasculature is also engorged, but I do not see pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
