AP portable upright view of the chest. Lung volumes are low. Overlying leads limits of best evaluation. Linear densities in lower lungs most compatible with atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding. Furthermore, subtle ground-glass opacity in the right lung base raises concern for an early pneumonia, possibly with a small right pleural effusion. Heart size appears mildly enlarged. The aorta is unfolded. An anchor at the right humeral head noted. Bones appear demineralized.
