1. The nasogastric tube still projects with its tip over the stomach. The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position with its tip in the proximal to mid SVC. Left chest tube remains in place. There is persistent patchy opacity at the left base likely with an associated effusion. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated. There is interval improvement in appearance of the interstitium consistent with resolved pulmonary edema. Consolidation at the left base may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Clips in the right upper quadrant are consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
