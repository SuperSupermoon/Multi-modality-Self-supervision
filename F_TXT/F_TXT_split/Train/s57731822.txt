There has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff feeding tube with the tip in the stomach. A smaller caliber nasoenteric catheter has been removed. A right PICC terminates in the low SVC. Bilateral pigtail chest tube drains are in unchanged expected position. The left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. Bibasilar opacities are similar to prior and likely reflect ongoing atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased in the interval. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The heart size remains mildly enlarged.
