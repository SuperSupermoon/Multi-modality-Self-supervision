A portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube which terminates approximately 9 cm above the carina. This could be advanced 3-4 cm for more optimal positioning in the mid trachea. The orogastric tube is appropriately positioned within the stomach. The lungs are clear. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
