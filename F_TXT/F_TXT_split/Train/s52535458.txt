AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained two hours earlier during the same day. Previously observed large needle instrument in right axillary area pointing towards right-sided mid mediastinum at tracheobronchial angle remains in unchanged position. Partially superimposed by a wide caliber sheath that terminates in the right-sided upper mediastinum just below the lower edge of the clavicle. A new flexible instrument has been advanced through the right lateral chest wall at the level of the fourth or fifth intercostal space and terminates overlying the right-sided perihilar area. The single view examination cannot determine whether this tube advances into the posterior or anterior pleural compartment. The lung remains well aerated without evidence of atelectasis and there is no pneumothorax in the apical area. The heart size is unchanged and in mitral position, the metallic component of a mitral annuloplasty repair is identified.
