Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragms. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged. Lung volumes are relatively low and there are increased interstitial markings bilaterally suggesting mild-to-moderate vascular congestion/edema. Blunting of the costophrenic angles is seen, which may relate to overlying soft tissue, although small pleural effusions may be present.
