There has been interval development of relatively extensive airspace opacity in the left mid lung. No silhouetting of the left heart border likely reflecting left lower lobe consolidation. There is a probable small left pleural effusion. The right lung appears grossly clear. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged compared to the prior study allowing for differences in imaging technique. No pneumothorax seen.
