Tracheostomy tube again noted. Right subclavian PICC line tip at SVC/RA junction, slightly more distal than on the prior film. Compared to the prior study, the biapical pneumothoraces are both slightly smaller, with residua small right apical and tiny left apical pneumothoraces. Mid zone opacities are again noted, but slightly fainter on today's exam. In part, however, this difference likely relates to differences in technique. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No effusions.
