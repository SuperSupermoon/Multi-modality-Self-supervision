Since prior, there has been interval placement of left-sided pigtail catheter projecting over the left costophrenic angle. There is no visualized pneumothorax on the current exam noting that the chin obscures portion of the lung apices bilaterally. Left basilar opacity is at least partially due to atelectasis. Fiducial marker now projects over the left mid upper lung focal opacity as seen on prior. Known spiculated right upper lung nodule is also noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
