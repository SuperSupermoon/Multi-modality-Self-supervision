AP chest compared to ___: Substantial worsening of left lower lobe consolidation, accompanied by increasing small pleural effusion. Since there is leftward mediastinal shift despite the concurrent development of right infrahilar atelectasis, the bulk of the left lower lobe abnormality is atelectasis. It could be due to aspiration or retained secretions and therefore predispose the patient to infection. Of more concern for pneumonia are several relatively well-circumscribed consolidative opacities, new in the right perihilar lung. Since there is new mild edema more evenly distributed in the lower right perihilar lung, the upper component could be asymmetric edema as well but should be entertained clinically as possible pneumonia. The heart is top normal size as before. There is no right pneumothorax. Tiny left apical pneumothorax is smaller today than yesterday. Of note, the stomach is moderately-to-severely distended with retained food. I discussed these findings, alternative explanations, and clinical significance with Dr. ___, by telephone at 9 a.m.
