As compared to the previous radiograph, a semi-supine portable radiograph is now provided. There are signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Size of the cardiac silhouette has slightly increased, as have the diameters of the vascular structures. The known hiatal hernia is unchanged. There currently is no evidence of pneumonia or pleural effusions. The lung volumes remain low, with areas of atelectasis at both lung bases.
