As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, likely as a result of increased an improved ventilation. There is an area of atelectatic opacities at the level of the right lung base, better seen than on the previous image, the left lower lobe remains partly atelectatic. The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Unchanged increase in diameter of the hilus at the level of the left pulmonary artery. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No new focal parenchymal opacities.
