Severe cardiomegaly is chronic, but larger recently. Pulmonary edema is mild. Left hilar enlargement is presumably vascular since it has progressed over the last 5 days concurrently with increased vascular ___ elsewhere. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes as far as the distal esophagus and out of view. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax.
