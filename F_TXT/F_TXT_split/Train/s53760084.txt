Tracheostomy project over the upper trachea. Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam. Increased opacity projecting over the left hemithorax compared to the right is compatible with persistent large pleural effusion. More dense retrocardiac opacity is noted, potentially from the effusion and atelectasis noting that infection would certainly be possible. There is also a suspected persistent right pleural effusion. Right PICC is identified although tip of the catheters not clearly delineated. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Median sternotomy wires are intact.
