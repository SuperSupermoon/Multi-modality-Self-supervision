In comparison with the study of ___, there are improved lung volumes. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with left ventricular prominence and mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The hemidiaphragms are quite well seen and there are residual atelectatic changes at the bases, more prominent on the right. The costophrenic angles are quite well seen, though this does not exclude the possibility of pleural fluid. If this is an important clinical determination, a lateral view could be obtained if the condition of the patient permits. If not, lateral decubitus views with horizontal beam could be obtained. The left PICC line is been pulled back. The appearance of the tip raises the possibility of extension into the azygos vein.
