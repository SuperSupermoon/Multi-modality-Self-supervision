Single frontal view of the chest again demonstrates multifocal pneumonia which has worsened from prior. The bilateral consolidations are denser and have resulted in obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and left heart border. Probable worsening of pulmonary edema is seen as well. The small left pleural effusion is unchanged and there is no pneumothorax.
