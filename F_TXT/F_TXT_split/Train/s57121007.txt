There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube. There is a persistent moderately large pleural effusion similar to slightly increased in size when compared to the prior study. There is a small amount of air within the pleural fluid. The right hilar mass is less clearly seen, partially obscured by a atelectasis related to the pleural fluid. The left lung appears grossly clear. The known pulmonary nodules are not clearly visualized. No pneumothorax seen.
