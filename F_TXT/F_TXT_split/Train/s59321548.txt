An enteric tube is in unchanged position with the tip in the stomach. A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged with the tip in the mid SVC. Again, there is bibasilar atelectasis, greater on the left than the right. No new opacities identified. There is no definite pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The pneumatocele at the right base is unchanged. The mediastinal contours are normal in size. The heart size is at the upper limits of normal. Again, there is a small amount of pneumomediastinum, though it appears to have decreased since the prior exam.
