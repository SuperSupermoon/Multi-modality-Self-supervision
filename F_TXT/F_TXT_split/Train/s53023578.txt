As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The lung volumes have slightly decreased. Areas of atelectasis at the lung bases are still present. The position of the right chest tube is constant. Constant blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, likely caused by a minimal pleural effusion. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax. The lucent line crossing the right lung apex is caused by a skin fold.
