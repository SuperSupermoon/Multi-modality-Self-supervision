A left PICC line tip is at the level of lower SVC. Left pigtail catheter is in place. Right central venous line tip is at the level of lower SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Pulmonary edema is demonstrated, similar to previous examination, mild. Tracheostomy is in place with its tip terminating approximately 6 cm above the carinal. Given the lordotic projection of the current study the precise positioning is difficult.
