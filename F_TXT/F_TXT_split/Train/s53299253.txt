Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is again seen a left retrocardiac opacity, likely due to a combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid. A small right-sided pleural effusion is also seen. Tracheostomy and right-sided central line are unchanged in position. There is unchanged cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pneumothoraces are present.
