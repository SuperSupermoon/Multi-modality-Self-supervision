The patient is status post recent median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery. Postoperative widening of cardiomediastinal contours is stable compared to recent radiographs. Worsening left retrocardiac opacity is likely a combination of substantial left lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion. Patchy and linear atelectasis is also present at the right lung base. No visible pneumothorax.
