Bilateral small pigtail catheters are visualized at both bases. There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left. The right effusion is increased in the interval since the prior day and the left effusion is decreased. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. There continues to be minimal pulmonary vascular redistribution. The upper lobes do not have an infiltrate. The lower lobes cannot be adequately assessed due to the overlying infiltrate, but volume loss is likely present. There is no pneumothorax.
