A chest tube again projects over the right hemithorax. There is a similar small quantity of associated subcutaneous emphysema along the right lateral chest wall and base of the neck. There is apparently a trace right apical pneumothorax but not substantial noting an in situ chest tube. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Increased volume loss and retrocardiac opacification are noted in the left lower lobe with a new small possible pleural effusion.
