Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates bilateral pleural effusions with linear opacity at the left lung base, which is new since the most recent examination, and likely represents atelectasis. Again noted are bibasilar, patchy opacities, which are not significantly changed since at least ___, except for some more nodular regions in the right peripheral lung. A possible retrocardiac opacity is present, which in the appropriate clinical context, may be consistent with pneumonia. No pneumothorax is identified. Tracheostomy tube is appropriately positioned.
