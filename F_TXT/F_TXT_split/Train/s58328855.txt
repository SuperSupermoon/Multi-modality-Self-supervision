Since the most recent examination, there has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube and a transesophageal tube. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina. The transesophageal tube terminates in the region of the stomach. Again seen are extensive bilateral multifocal opacities, unchanged since recent CT.
