In comparison with the study of ___, there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with pulmonary edema. The possibility of superimposed pneumonia or pulmonary contusion would be difficult to exclude on this single image. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2.7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the level of the esophagogastric junction, where it crosses the lower margin of the image. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid portion of the SVC. No evidence of pneumothorax.
