Since the most recent chest radiograph performed on ___, there has been slight interval progression of multifocal airspace consolidations, which affects all lungs lobes. However, note that this is also exaggerated by low lung volumes. Pleural effusions are present bilaterally, new on the right. No pneumothorax. Tip of the right Port-A-Cath is unchanged and terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Remote right sixth rib fracture.
