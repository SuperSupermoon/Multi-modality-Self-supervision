There are bilateral chest drains in-situ. These are unchanged in position when compared to the prior study. The side hole of the right-sided chest strain is close to the chest wall but appears to be within the pleural space. Small amount subcutaneous emphysema has decreased when compared to the prior study. Lung volumes remain low. No pneumothorax seen. Apparent widening of the cardiomediastinal contour is likely due to the projection.
