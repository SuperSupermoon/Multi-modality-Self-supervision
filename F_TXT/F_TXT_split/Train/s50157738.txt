Prosthetic aortic valve in the proximal aorta has been placed. Cardiac silhouette is somewhat enlarged and there is mitral valve calcification. There are probable layering effusions with some atelectatic change at the base, especially at the left lower lobe. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure and kyphoplasty procedures are evident. The endotracheal tube is at the orifice of the right main stem bronchus and must be pulled back about 4 cm. This information was telephoned by Dr. ___ to clinical team .
