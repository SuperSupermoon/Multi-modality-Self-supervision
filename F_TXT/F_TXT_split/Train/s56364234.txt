Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is present. The aortic knob is calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Moderate pulmonary edema is slightly worse in the interval. There are increased bilateral lower lobe opacities, likely reflective of worsening atelectasis, with moderate to large right and small to moderate size left pleural effusions, increased in size compared to the previous study. No pneumothorax.
