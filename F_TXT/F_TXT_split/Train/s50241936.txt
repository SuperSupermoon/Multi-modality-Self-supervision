The endotracheal tube seats 3.5-4 cm above the carina. A left-sided central line tip is within the upper right atrium/lower cavoatrial junction. An endogastric feeding tube demonstrates its tip sitting in the distal portion of the stomach/early portion of the duodenum. Four metallic coil/clip densities project over the expected region of the stomach. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Bibasilar opacities persist, more extensive on the right than the left, and progressed from prior studies. Mild pulmonary edema is present. Bilateral pleural effusions, small, also persist. There is no pneumothorax.
