Single frontal view of the chest. A tracheostomy is seen in adequate position. Bibasilar opacities are seen, which may represent atelectasis but cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting. There is moderate right pleural effusion. The left costophrenic angle is not included on this exam, but no left pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
