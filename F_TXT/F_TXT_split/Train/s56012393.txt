No previous images. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with left ventricular prominence. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia. Dual-channel pacemaker/ICD leads are in good position. There is mild opacification in the retrocardiac region. This most likely reflects atelectasis, though superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
