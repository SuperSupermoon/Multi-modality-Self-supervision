Right sided PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC. The patient is status post median sternotomy and closure hardware with CABG clips. Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is compatible with a small pleural effusion, decreased in extent compared to the prior exam. Small right pleural effusion also appears smaller compared to the prior exam. Streaky left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax, though the patient's chin slightly obscures evaluation of the extreme lung apices. No pulmonary vascular congestion is seen. Right curvilinear subdiaphragmatic lucency is compatible with pneumoperitoneum, which is not unexpected in this patient on peritoneal dialysis.
