Dextropositioning appears similar to the prior examination. Lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including moderate tortuosity of the aorta, a large epicardial fat pad, and substantial hiatal hernia. There is no definitive pleural effusion, but blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus suggests there may be a small effusion. Streaky basilar opacities are more prominent in the right lower lung than left, but not striking and compatible with atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, although early infection could be considered. There is no frank congestive heart failure.
