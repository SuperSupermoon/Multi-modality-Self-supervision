CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. A Dobbhoff-type tube is present, with stylet apparently in place. Althugh midline over the upper mediastinum, it courses to the left of the lower mediastinum. The radiopaque tip overlies the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. This could lie within the gastric fundus, though is difficult to confirm on this single view. Cardiomediastinal enlargement, bilateral L>R effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation, as well as diffuse vascular blurring are similar to a film obtained ___ at 14:26 p.m. Clips again over left lower neck.
