AP chest compared to ___: No pneumothorax or pleural effusion and the slight increase in upper mediastinal caliber is due to lower lung volumes and more vascular engorgement, not mediastinal bleeding. Mild cardiomegaly is also worse and both hila are more engorged, attesting to volume overload or mild relative biventricular heart failure. Pleural effusion is not appreciable and there is no pulmonary edema.
