Heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged, with unfolding of the thoracic aorta. The right basilar atelectasis and consolidation which was seen previously has improved in the interval. There is persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and minimal plate-like atelectasis at the left lung base. Minimal increase in prominence of the upper zone pulmonary vasculature suggest borderline pulmonary vascular congestion. No pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. The osseous structures appear unchanged.
