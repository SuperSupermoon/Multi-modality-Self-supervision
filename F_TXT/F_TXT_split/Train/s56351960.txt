Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained yesterday. Widespread parenchymal consolidations are unchanged and currently in addition to the pattern of pulmonary edema, there is potentially more focal opacity in the left perihilar area although partially obscured by overlying device that might reflect developing infectious process. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
