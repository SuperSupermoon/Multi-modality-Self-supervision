Tip of endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above the carinal with the neck in a flexed position, and side-port of nasogastric tube as above the level of the gastroesophageal junction. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal considering low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities are suggestive of atelectasis and note is also made of small left and possible small right pleural effusion, but no visible pneumothorax.
