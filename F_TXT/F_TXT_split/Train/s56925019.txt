There has been interval placement of a left-sided PICC line, with tip projecting at the mid SVC. The tracheostomy tube appears unchanged in position. Lung volumes remain low, with persistent mild cardiomegaly. Crowding of bronchovascular structures with pulmonary vascular congestion is again noted. Patchy opacities in the bilateral lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, aspiration, or infection. No larger pleural effusions.
