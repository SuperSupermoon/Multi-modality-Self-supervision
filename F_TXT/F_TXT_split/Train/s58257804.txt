Single AP view of the chest. New compared to priors is dense retrocardiac opacity. There is also a right basilar opacity silhouetting the costophrenic angle. Findings may be due to pleural effusions with underlying atelectasis or infection also possible. Pulmonary vascular markings are indistinct. Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged, unchanged given differences in technique and rotation to the left. Left chest wall dual lead pacing device is again noted as well as median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips.
