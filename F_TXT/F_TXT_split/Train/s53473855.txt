As compared to the previous image, the monitoring and support devices are constant, with the exception that the right PICC line was removed. In the interval, a right basal small pleural effusion, combined to a small parenchymal opacity has newly developed. The findings would be consistent with developing pneumonia or aspiration. Low lung volumes persist. Unchanged mild fluid overload. Constant appearance of the left pleural effusion.
