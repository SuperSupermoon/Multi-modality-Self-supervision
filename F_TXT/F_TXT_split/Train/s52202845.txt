Compared with the prior film, the right IJ central line tip has been retracted and now lies at the level of the SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax is detected. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Incidental note is made of a widened right AC joint and tapered distal clavicle, ? related to prior surgery.
