AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made to the next preceding similar study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day. Patient has now been intubated. The ETT is seen to terminate in the trachea 5 cm above the level of the carina. A right internal jugular approach sheath appears unchanged in position. Permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position connected to two intracavitary electrodes as before. Additional right-sided pacing wire advanced from the right subclavian vein which is in similar ventricular location probably used for temporary pacing. No pneumothorax is identified,. The previously described scattered parenchymal densities have progressed and appear rather widespread. The pulmonary vasculature again shows distended vessels with perivascular haze. Thus, the findings appear to be a combination of pulmonary vascular congestion and scattered superimposed infiltrates.
