Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.9 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach, and off the inferior borders of the film. Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC, unchanged. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob. Patchy opacity within the right mid lung field persists. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
