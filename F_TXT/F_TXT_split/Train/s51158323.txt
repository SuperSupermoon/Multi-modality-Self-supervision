The single lead of a left chest wall generator has a different course compared to the most recent prior chest radiograph. The pacer wire previously extended linearly from the right atrium to the right ventricle but currently appears coiled predominantly to the right of midline. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
