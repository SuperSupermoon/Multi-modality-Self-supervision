There is marked cardiomegaly, with upper zone redistribution and interstial and some pulmonary edema. There is more confluent opacity at R>L basess, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation. No gross effusion, though small effusions could be present. The mediastinal contours and hila appear prominent on this exam.
