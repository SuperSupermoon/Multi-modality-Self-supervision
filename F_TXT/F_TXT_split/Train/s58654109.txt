The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with aortic knob calcifications. Right infrahilar opacity is also again noted, slightly less dense than on the most recent prior study, which may represent scarring. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The lungs are well expanded without focal consolidation. Two punctate opacities projecting over the right apex are consistent with calcified granuloma. The upper abdomen is unremarkable.
