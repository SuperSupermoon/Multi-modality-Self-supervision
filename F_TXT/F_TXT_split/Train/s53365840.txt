With the chin slightly flexed, tip of the endotracheal tube, approximately a cm from the carina is 2 cm below optimal placement. Opacification at the left lung base is probably atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion may be present. There is no evidence of right pleural effusion. Right lung is low in volume but clear. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax.
