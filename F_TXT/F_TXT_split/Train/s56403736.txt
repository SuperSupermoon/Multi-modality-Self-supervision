Lordotic positioning and low inspiratory volumes. An ET tube is present, tip lies approximately 5 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present -- the tip is not well delineated but appears to overlie the stomach. A left-sided chest tube is present at the left lung base. Left subclavian central line tip overlies the proximal SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. There is upper zone redistribution, pulmonary vascular plethora, and vascular blurring, suggesting CHF, but likely also accentuated by technique. There is patchy retrocardiac opacity. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, with slight atelectasis at the right base. No gross effusion identified. No pneumothorax detected. Subcutaneous emphysema noted along the left chest wall. Compared with ___ at 3:42 a.m., the vascular plethora is worse. Retrocardiac density may also be slightly worse.
