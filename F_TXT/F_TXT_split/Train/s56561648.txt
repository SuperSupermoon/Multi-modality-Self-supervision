As compared to previous study of 1 day earlier, left pigtail pleural catheter has been replaced or repositioned, with apparent slight decrease in size of small left pleural effusion. Small to moderate right pleural effusion appears slightly larger although positional differences may contribute to this apparent change. Bibasilar atelectasis has also apparently slightly worsened in the interval.
