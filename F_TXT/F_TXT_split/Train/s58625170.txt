Compared with the prior study and allowing for differences in technique, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is chest tube at the right lung base, with a small effusion and underlying atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected. The tip of a presumed NG tube overlies the medial right lung inferiorly, in this patient with a neo esophagus. Minimal atelectasis and mild patchy retrocardiac opacity are similar to the prior film.
