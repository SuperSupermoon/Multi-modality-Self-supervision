The left PICC line is malpositioned, terminating within the right brachiocephalic vein. The linear opacities within the left midlung likely represent atelectasis, although the previously visualized bibasilar atelectasis has significantly improved. There is mild vascular congestion, but no frank pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. There are no large pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
