AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in semi-upright position. The patient is now mildly rotated to the right. Still one can identify a tracheostomy cannula that has entered the trachea and terminates some 4 cm above the level of the carina. No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. Also noted is the presence of an NG tube that has reached far below the diaphragm including its side port. There are multiple cables and external structures that are overlying the chest. In the chest itself, no evidence of acute infiltrates or pulmonary vascular congestion.
