Single AP supine view of the chest was obtained. Allowing for differences in technique and positioning, cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Heavy calcifications are again noted in the aortic arch and the tracheobronchial tree. The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Deviation of the trachea may relate to an enlarged thyroid gland.
