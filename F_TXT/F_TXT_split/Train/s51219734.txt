Bilateral lung volumes remain low. Tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 6 cm from the carina, ending above the level of the clavicular head. Consider advancing the endotracheal tube by additional 2 to 2.5 cm for better seating. Left subclavian line tip is at mid SVC and an orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach, but its distal end is off the radiographic view. Since yesterday, bibasal lung opacities reflecting atelectasis and/or consolidation have improved, more so on the right side. Given the low lung volumes, mild pulmonary vascular congestion may be exaggerated. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Small right pleural effusion is stable.
