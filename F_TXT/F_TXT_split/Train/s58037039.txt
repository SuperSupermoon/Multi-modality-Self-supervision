A tracheostomy tube is in place, 4.8 cm from the carina. A VP shunt catheter is seen overlying the left chest, unchanged from prior exams. The lung volumes are low. A linear opacity at the right base and mild volume loss is consistent with atelectasis. Left basilar atelectasis is also present. This is similar in appearance to the prior chest radiograph in ___. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
