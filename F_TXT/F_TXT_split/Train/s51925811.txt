A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the superior vena cava. The lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. A retrocardiac opacity appears increased. Atelectasis or developing pneumonia are differential diagnoses for this appearance. Known pulmonary nodules are not optimally visualized on the portable radiography. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
