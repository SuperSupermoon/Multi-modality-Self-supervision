Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. Patient has respiratory failure. Mild pulmonary edema has increased. There are low lung volumes. Right lower lobe opacity was likely atelectasis. Left perihilar opacity is unchanged could be due to fluid in the fissure or residual of previously larger consolidation. Cardiac size is top normal. Right chest tube tip in the apex is unchanged. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid to lower SVC. HD catheter tip is in the right atrium; there is no pneumothorax. NG tube tip is in the stomach; the side port is distal to the EG junction can be advanced few centimeters for more standard position.
