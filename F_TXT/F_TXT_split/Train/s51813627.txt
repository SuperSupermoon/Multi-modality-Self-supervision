As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. There is increased crowding of the bronchial and vascular structures at the lung bases and an increase in pulmonary hydration. However, no overt signs of pulmonary edema are present. The region of the left hilus looks minimally denser than on the previous image, but this might be consequence of patient rotation and technical factors. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
