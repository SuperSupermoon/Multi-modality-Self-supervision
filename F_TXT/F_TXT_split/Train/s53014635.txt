Endotracheal tube, central venous catheter, nasogastric tube, and ICD remain in standard position. Heart is enlarged, and is accompanied by pulmonary vascular engorgement and improving perihilar edema. Dense left retrocardiac opacity corresponds to left lower lobe collapse on companion CTA study of the chest, dictated separately. Confluent opacity at right base is slightly improved and could relate to dependent edema, but coexisting infection is possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Small right and moderate left effusion are again demonstrated, slightly improved on the right.
