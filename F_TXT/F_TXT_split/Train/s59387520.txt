As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The lung volumes are normal. Known calcified 1.5 cm structure in the left lung. No parenchymal scars, notably around the left hilus. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pulmonary edema, no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. A hyperlucent line, bilaterally paralleling the pleura, is caused by the breast shadow.
