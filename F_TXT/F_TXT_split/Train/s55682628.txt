ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Leftward mediastinal shift suggests opacification in the left lower lobe is largely atelectasis. Right Lung clear. Left pleural effusion small if any. No pneumothorax. Right pic line ends in the low SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette unremarkable. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such abnormalities. If the demonstration of a fracture or other trauma is clinically warranted, the location where there are focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
