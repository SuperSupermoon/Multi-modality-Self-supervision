In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a right pigtail catheter with apparent drainage of a large amount fluid from the right pleural space. There may be a tiny apical pneumothorax. Monitoring and support devices are unchanged. There is now hazy opacification of the left hemithorax with obscuration hemidiaphragm, consistent with substantial layering pleural effusion on this side.
