Portable AP upright radiograph through the chest demonstrates a right-sided internal jugular vein which terminates at the low a SVC. This appears in unchanged position when compared to most recent radiograph. Patient is status post extubation and enteric tube removal. Patient is status post sternotomy with median sternotomy wires intact. Surgical clips are noted projecting over the left hemithorax. Chest tubes have been removed. New since prior examination, there is increased opacification at the left lung base with obscuration of the left costophrenic angle concerning for pleural effusion and most likely atelectatic changes. There is mild shift of the trachea rightward which may reflect projectional differences. There is improved aeration and increased lung volume within the right hemithorax. No pneumothorax is visualized.
