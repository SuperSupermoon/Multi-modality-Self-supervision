AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip most likely passes below the diaphragm and not seen on the current examination.

Right lower lung consolidation is unchanged. The upper lungs are grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax.
