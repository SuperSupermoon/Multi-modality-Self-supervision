Single AP portable chest radiograph was obtained. Right upper lung opacity is slightly more evident than on the previous examination. Otherwise the lungs are low in volume giving the appearance of bronchovascular crowding with mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt edema. Linear retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is top-normal in size with tortuous thoracic aortic contour.
