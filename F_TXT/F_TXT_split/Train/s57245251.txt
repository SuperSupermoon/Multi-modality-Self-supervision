A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged with dual leads terminating in the right atrium and the right ventricle with the ventricular lead oriented superiorly towards the free wall of the right ventricle, as before. There is increased interstitial thickening bilaterally on the right greater than the left consistent with worsening interstitial pulmonary edema. There is substantial atelectasis if not complete collapse of the right lower lobe from ___. Increased opacification of the right lung base silhouetting the diaphragm suggests increased small to moderate right pleural effusion. There is slightly improved aeration at the left lung base with a persistent small pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present. Prominence of the aortic knob widening the mediastinal contour is unchanged, likely related to an unfolded thoracic aorta; however, aneurysmal dilatation of the thoracic aorta or dissection is not excluded. This appearance is new from the remote prior ___ study but unchanged from ___. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable.
