As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is now severely rotated towards the right. A direct comparison of the pulmonary artery catheter therefore is not reliably possible. The size of the cardiac silhouette as well as the bilateral pleural effusions with subsequent areas of atelectasis and the signs of mild to moderate pulmonary edema have not substantially changed.
