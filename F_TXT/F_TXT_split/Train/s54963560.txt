Lordotic positioning may artificially change the appearance of the lung base pathology. Allowing for this, the opacification of the right lower lung is slightly improved compared with ___, and residual right pleural effusion is small if present at all. The persistent opacification of the more medial right lung base is concerning for consolidation. Retrocardiac opacification is increased compared to prior studies, also concerning for a focus of consolidation. Taken together, this could represent multifocal pneumonia, which is more prominent as pleural effusions recede. The postoperative changes in the left lung apex are unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
