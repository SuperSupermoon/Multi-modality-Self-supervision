Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. Lower lung bandlike opacities are noted bilaterally which could represent atelectasis, less likely aspiration. Otherwise the lungs appear clear. Limited evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is unrevealing. The mediastinal contour appears normal. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Subtle deformities along the poster lateral arch of left ___ and 10th ribs appear chronic.
