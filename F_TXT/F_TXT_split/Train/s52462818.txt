Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. A right central venous line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. Bibasilar consolidations are unchanged, right more than left. Mild vascular engorgement is noted at the edge of pulmonary edema. Right lower consolidation might potentially reflect part of the edema but infectious process is a possibility, with similar appearance on the left. No new abnormalities demonstrated.
