As compared to previous radiograph from approximately 2 hr and ___ min earlier, there remains near complete collapse of the remaining right middle and right lower lobes in this patient status post recent right upper lobe resection, with only a small amount of aerated lung superiorly bordered by the apical pleural surface. Right main bronchus appears better aerated proximally compared to the recent radiograph, with abrupt termination located more distally than on the prior radiograph. Substantial right hydro pneumothorax is unchanged during the short time interval with chest tube remaining in place.
