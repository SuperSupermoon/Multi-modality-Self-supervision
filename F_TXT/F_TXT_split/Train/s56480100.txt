Single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained. Since the prior exam at 6:00 a.m., rightward mediastinal shift has significantly increased. There is increased atelectasis in the right middle lobe and partial collapse of the right lower lobe. A vague opacity projecting over the bronchus intermedius may represent a mucus plug. A tracheostomy tube is in stable position. An enteric catheter extends inferiorly off the edge of the film. The left lung is clear.
