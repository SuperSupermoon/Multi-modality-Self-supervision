Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal contour is unremarkable with atherosclerotic calcifications demonstrated at the aortic knob. Moderate pulmonary edema appears slightly worse in the interval. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis. Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine as well as within the acromioclavicular joints bilaterally.
