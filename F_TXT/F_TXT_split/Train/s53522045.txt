As compared to the prior examination dated ___, there has been interval progression of multifocal airspace opacities. Bilateral pulmonary edema is now moderate. A small right pleural effusion is noted. The left costophrenic angle is blunted and may be secondary to a small left pleural effusion or consolidation. A large, left, subpleural opacity is consistent with known metastatic rib lesions. Moderate cardiomegaly is noted. The mediastinum is minimally widened as compared to the prior examination, likely secondary to patient positioning and mediastinal vein distension. Monitoring and support devices are unchanged in position.
