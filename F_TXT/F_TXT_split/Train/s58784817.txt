An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position approximately 6.3 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of field of view. A right internal jugular catheter is unchanged with the tip in the mid-to-upper SVC. Extensive parenchymal opacities throughout the entire left lung and in the right middle and lower lung zones are similar to the prior exam. There is no new opacity. There are likely tiny bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
