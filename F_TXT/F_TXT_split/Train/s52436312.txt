1. Feeding tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right basilar chest tube remains in place. There is still a pneumothorax but it is difficult to assess for interval change given supine technique on the current study. However, it is likely not enlarging. There is improved aeration at the left base suggesting resolving atelectasis. Small left effusion is likely still present. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
