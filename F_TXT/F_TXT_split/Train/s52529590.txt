A single portable semi-erect frontal view of the chest was obtained. An endotracheal tube is approximately 3 cm above the carina. The enteric tube is within the stomach. A right central venous (IJ) catheter terminates in the right atrium. Prominent streaky opacifications in the left and right bases could reflect atelectasis or aspiration. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no large pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
