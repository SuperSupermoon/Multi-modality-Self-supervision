Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. Lung volumes are low which causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is re- demonstrated. There is no pneumothorax. No large pleural effusion is identified although the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view as the patient could not cooperate with positioning instructions.
