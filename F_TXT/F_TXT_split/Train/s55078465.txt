Heart size is normal, compared 2 mild cardiomegaly on ___ indicating that some of the by lateral lower lobe predominant pulmonary opacifications since ___ is pulmonary edema. However this was preceded by consolidation in the right lower lobe and atelectasis in the left suggesting aspiration. Currently left basal opacification probably a combination of atelectasis and residual edema is unchanged over night, but there is more opacification on the right. It is hard to say whether this is due to more pleural effusion or developing consolidation in the right lower lung. The upper lung is clear. Overall lung volumes are hyperinflated and emphysema would explain basal predominant edema, if any. Esophageal drainage tube is still looped in the hypopharynx alongside what I think is an intended esophageal probe for either temperature or pressure, before it passes into the stomach and out of view. ET tube in standard placement.
