As compared to the previous radiograph, the stomach continues to be overinflated. In addition, there is an increase in diameter of the pulmonary vasculature, an increase in size of the right upper mediastinum and newly appeared perihilar haze. Finally, areas of basilar atelectasis are seen. Overall, the findings are highly suggestive for moderate pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
