Rightward shift of the postoperative mediastinum looks more pronounced today, even though there is opacification at the base of the lung medially where previously there was a pleural line with air on both sides. I suspect this is collapse of the right middle lobe. Apical component of persistent pleural space is slightly larger. Left lung is clear. Heart size normal. Stomach is considerably distended with air and fluid. Dr. ___ was paged at 11:55 a.m. as soon as the study was reviewed.
