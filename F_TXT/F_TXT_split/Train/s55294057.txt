In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube, with its tip approximately 6.5 cm above the carina. There are lower lung volumes. The left hemidiaphragm again is obscured, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small pleural effusion. No evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
