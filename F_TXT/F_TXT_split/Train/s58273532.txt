Single frontal portable view of the chest was obtained. The heart is enlarged and its right border is silhouetted by right lung base consolidation, which is increased since ___ and compatible with pneumonia, pleural effusion, or a combination of both. The left lung is clear. No pneumothorax is identified. A right central catheter terminates in the low SVC. Left humeral hardware is similar to prior and right humeral hardware is incompletely imaged.
