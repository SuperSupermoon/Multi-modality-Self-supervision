AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided. There are low lung volumes with vague opacities in the lower lungs, which could represent atelectasis; however, early pneumonia is not excluded. No large effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable. Bony structures are intact.
