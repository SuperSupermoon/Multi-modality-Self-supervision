Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.5 cm from the carina. Heart size appears borderline enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. There is no pulmonary edema. Attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices suggest underlying emphysema. Scarring within the lung apices is noted. Streaky right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified although the left costophrenic angle is not completely included in the field of view.
