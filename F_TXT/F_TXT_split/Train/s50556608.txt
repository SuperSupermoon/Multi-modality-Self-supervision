Post pyloric feeding tube is noted with tip coursing off the right inferior border of the film. The cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged, increased compared to the previous exam. Mediastinal contours are unchanged and compatible with known mediastinal lymphadenopathy. There is new perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. A moderate size left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion are unchanged from the chest CT from ___, but new from ___. Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Mutliple pulmonary nodules seen on the prior CT are somewhat obscured by the pulmonary edema on the current exam. Expansile lytic lesion of the right 8th rib is re- demonstrated. Other known lytic lesions within the thorax are not well assessed on the current exam.
