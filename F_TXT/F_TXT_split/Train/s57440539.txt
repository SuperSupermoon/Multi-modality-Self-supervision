Bedside AP radiograph of the chest re-demonstrates the patient's longstanding chronic left lower lobe collapse. Between ___ and yesterday, a segment of aerated lung overlying the left heart border has become uniformly opacified. This may be due to atelectasis of the lingula. The lungs are otherwise clear. Heart is top normal in size and chronically leftward shifted. Once again, the left PICC terminates within the right atrium and would need to be withdrawn 5.5 cm to ensure placement in the low SVC.
