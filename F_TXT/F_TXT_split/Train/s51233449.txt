Single AP view of the chest was reviewed. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax. Dense parenchymal opacities, especially in the lower lung zones, are consistent with severe pulmonary edema. There is no large pleural effusion. Displacement of the trachea to the left may be the result of a goiter in the right lobe of the thyroid.
