Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is present. There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema. A right hilar opacity is likely exaggerated secondary to patient rotation and overlap with the mediastinum. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. The descending thoracic aorta is noted to be somewhat tortuous. A chronic, left humeral fracture is incidentally noted.
