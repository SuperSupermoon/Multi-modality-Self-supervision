The patient is status post mitral valve replacement. A three-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged. The heart is similarly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, including a prominence of right hilar structures suggesting mild enlarged central pulmonary arteries. Vague opacification, particularly prominent in the mid and lower lungs, suggests mild vascular congestion. In addition, the left hemidiaphragm is obscured by retrocardiac opacity and a suspected pleural effusion. The retrocardiac opacity would be typical for atelectasis associated with a pleural effusion, but pneumonia is an additional consideration in the appropriate clinical setting.
