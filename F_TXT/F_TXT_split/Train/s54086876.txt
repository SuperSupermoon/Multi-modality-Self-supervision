Right apical pleural drain is still in place. There is no appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusion. A wedge shaped area of radiopacity is more discrete today than earlier postoperatively, but I suspect it is a region of atelectasis that previously occupied a more superior location in the chest. Without details of surgical resection however an at a loss to explain exactly what it is. I am also concerned that it could be loculated fluid which the patient might benefit from draining, presuming that surgery did not and tail a pleural tenth. As such, CT scanning would be definitive in distinguishing between consolidated or atelectatic lung and fluid collection. Borderline cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are chronic but there is no pulmonary edema. Right internal jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC. I have asked Dr. ___, covering this patient, to discuss these findings together.
