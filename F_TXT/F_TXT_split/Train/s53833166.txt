A right PICC is present with tip terminating in the mid SVC. There has been a change in contour of the left pleural drainage catheter, with slight retraction of the distal aspect of the tube and an area of kinking, which may be outside the patient. A small left pleural effusion is slightly smaller than on the most recent prior study. There has been improved aeration in the left lower lobe. Increased haziness in the left mid lung may also reflect some pleural fluid. Small right pleural effusion slightly increased compared to prior, and mild right base atelectasis persist. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax. Lung volumes are normal, and there is no new focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. There is no pneumoperitoneum. Gaseous distension of the stomach is again noted. A CBD stent is in stable position.
