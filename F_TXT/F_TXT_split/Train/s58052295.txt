The left lower thorax is not imaged. Stable bilateral moderate pleural effusions, worse on the left. Slight improvement of pulmonary edema from yesterday. Stable cardiomegaly. The endotracheal tube is in appropriate and stable position, approximately 4 cm above the carina. A left internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC. There is no pneumothorax. A nasogastric tube can be seen coursing through the stomach, duodenum, and terminates below the plane of the image in the jejunum. There is an unchanged pigtail catheter over the expected location of the pancreas.
