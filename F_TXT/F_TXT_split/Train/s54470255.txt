As compared to prior chest radiograph of 1 day earlier, cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and worsening bibasilar opacities superimposed upon chronic interstitial lung disease and emphysema.

Small to moderate right hydropneumothorax with apical and basilar components has slightly increased in the interval and the fluid component is new.
