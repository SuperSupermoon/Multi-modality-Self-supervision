Compared to the prior study, there is continued right upper lobe volume loss with increased opacification, consistent with superimposed pneumonia. A left-sided pacemaker is in place. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured, suggesting substantial left lower lobe volume loss. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
