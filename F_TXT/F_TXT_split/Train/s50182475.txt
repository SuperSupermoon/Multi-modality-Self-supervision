A semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating appropriately in the mid trachea, approximately 5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube traverses the esophagus, enters the stomach, and passes inferiorly out of the field of view. There are bilateral perihilar opacities and indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature. The heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
