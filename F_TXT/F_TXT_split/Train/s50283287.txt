There is moderately severe pulmonary edema predominantly in a perihilar distribution. Superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude, particularly at the lung bases. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests at least a small pleural effusion. No sizable pleural effusion on the right. No pneumothorax. Heart size is enlarged. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
