Portable upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval increase in right pleural effusion, tracking along the fissures. Underlying right lower lobe atelectasis is also present, and super-imposed infection cannot be completely excluded. Multifocal consolidations in the left lung are also concerning for infection. The right heart border is obscured and there is slight deviation of the mediastinal structures to the left. Multiple surgical clips are present in the left upper quadrant.
