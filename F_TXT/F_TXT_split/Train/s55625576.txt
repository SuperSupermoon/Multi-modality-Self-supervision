As compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, pulmonary vascular congestion is now accompanied by moderate pulmonary edema. Moderate to large right and small left pleural effusions have apparently increased in size. There remains postobstructive collapse of the right lower lobe and partial atelectasis of the right middle lobe.
