In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of 2 chest tubes following vats decortication on the left. The degree of opacification related to pleural effusion has substantially decreased, though some fluid and atelectasis is still seen at the left base. Specifically, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Otherwise, little change.
