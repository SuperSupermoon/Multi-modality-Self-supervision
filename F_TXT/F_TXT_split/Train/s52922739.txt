Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. New nasogastric tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm, which is elevated. Diffuse opacities overlying both lungs has increased since ___. Opacity overlying the left base is compatible with a moderate to large pleural effusion with probable underlying consolidation. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle persists, compatible with a moderate pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly may be exaggerated by patient rotation.
