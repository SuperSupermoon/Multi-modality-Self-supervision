A single AP portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter with its tip in the mid-to-upper SVC. No pneumothorax is seen. The exam is otherwise unchanged compared to the radiograph from earlier today, approximately hours ago.
