Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions appear larger than on the prior study, but differences in positioning could potentially contribute to this apparent change. Adjacent areas of increased opacity at the lung bases probably represent atelectasis.
