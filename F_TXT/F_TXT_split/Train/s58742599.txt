AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 15 hours earlier during the same date. The density in the left hemithorax ascribed to pleural effusion has increased and results in an apparent mediastinal shift towards the right. Unfortunately, the patient is slightly rotated towards the right which to be taken into consideration as it can simulate at least in parts a right-sided mediastinal shift. The evidence of some deviation of the trachea towards the right, already seen on the previous portable chest examination, however, makes increasing pleural effusion as the cause of the mediastinal shift most likely. Cardiac Surgery was alerted via telephone of these findings. Telephone message was rendered to telephone ___ and attending physician, ___ who received the message expressed in this report.
