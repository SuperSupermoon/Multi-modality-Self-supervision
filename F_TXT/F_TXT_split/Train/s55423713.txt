In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with minimal elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Increased opacification at the right base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. The nasogastric tube can only be followed to the lower esophagus, where it is obscured by the density of the abdomen. Further evaluation would require a repeat study using abdominal technique and centered at the carina.
