AP chest compared to ___: Previous mild pulmonary edema has resolved, moderate right and small left pleural effusions persist and opacification at both lung bases is most commonly atelectasis, but I cannot exclude pneumonia, particularly on the left. The severely enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable postoperatively and comparable to the preoperative appearance. Feeding tube passes into the proximal duodenum. Left subclavian line ends at the junction of brachiocephalic veins. No pneumothorax.
