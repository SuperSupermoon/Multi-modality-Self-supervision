There is an ET tube terminating approximately 4.7 cm above the Carina. Pacemaker with pacer wires, LVAD device, enteric tube remain unchanged compared to the prior radiograph. Right-sided PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Low lung volumes with bilateral pleural effusions and marked cardiomegaly with hilar vascular prominence is again noted. New linear opacities in the right upper and paracardiac region likely represent atelectasis. No interval change in bony thorax.
