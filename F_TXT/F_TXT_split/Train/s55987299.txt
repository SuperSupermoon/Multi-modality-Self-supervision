In comparison to chest radiograph earlier today, there has been interval improvement in the right basilar opacity. The left basilar opacity is grossly unchanged and likely reflects atelectasis, though infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no new consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No pulmonary vascular congestion.
