In comparison with the study ___ ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with poor definition of the pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The left hemidiaphragm is poorly seen and there is blunting of the costophrenic angle, both suggesting a combination of volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Again, some of the hazy opacification at the bases could reflect scatter radiation related to the size of the patient.
