Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided. In this patient with known metastatic disease to the right hemithorax, there is overall no significant interval change in appearance of vague opacity within the right mid lung, right lung apex and right lung base, with suture material again noted projecting over the right upper lung. These findings are overall stable and likely reflect unchanged metastatic disease. The left lung remains clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures appear intact.
