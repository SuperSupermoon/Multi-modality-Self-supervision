AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. Right chest tube is in place. There is no interval development of pleural effusion or increasing pneumothorax. Packing material is projecting over the abdomen. Tubes and lines are in unchanged position except for the left subclavian line with its tip currently projecting over low SVC.
