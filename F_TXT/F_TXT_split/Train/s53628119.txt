AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Endotracheal tube ends above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 8.5 cm from the carina and should be advanced 4-5 cm for standard placement. New opacification in the right upper paramediastinal hemithorax is accompanied by mild rightward mediastinal shift and therefore is probably not a mediastinal hematoma. It could be upper lobe atelectasis or bleeding, since the minor fissure is not displaced. A right pleural tube traverses the right chest horizontally. Whether it is fissural or in the pleural space or has traumatized the lung is radiographically indeterminate. Left apical cap does, however, raise possibility of upper mediastinal bleeding. Dr. ___ was paged at 1:35 p.m., when the examination was reviewed.
