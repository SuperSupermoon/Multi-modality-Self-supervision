A left pectoral AICD has a single lead in unchanged position. The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. The mediastinal contours are stable. There is pulmonary vascular congestion with increased bibasilar opacities from the prior study suggesting increased dependent pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated.
