An endotracheal tube and enteric tube are unchanged in position. There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter ending in the low SVC. The appearance of the chest is otherwise unchanged with low lung volumes and diffuse parenchymal opacities in the left lung as well as probable small bilateral pleural effusions. No large pneumothorax is seen on this single view. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
