Comparison is made to a chest radiograph from ___. There has been placement of a nasogastric tube whose tip is in the lower esophagus. This could be advanced several centimeters for more optimal placement. However, the catheter appears to be coursing towards the right side but is not within the right main stem bronchus. The left-sided subclavian catheter has its distal lead tip in the distal SVC. Heart size is upper limits of normal. There is a very large hiatal hernia. No pneumothoraces are identified.
