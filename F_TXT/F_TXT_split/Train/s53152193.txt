As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. As a consequence, there is minimal crowding of the vascular and interstitial structures at the lung bases, right more than left. The size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased. No evidence of pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.
