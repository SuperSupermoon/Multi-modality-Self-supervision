Lung volumes are low with crowding of the vasculature and bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflecting atelectasis rather than aspiration or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. Probable small layering left effusion. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina. No pneumothorax.
