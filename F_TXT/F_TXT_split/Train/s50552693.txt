Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged, similar to the previous study. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Streaky opacities are seen in both lung bases without focal consolidation. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is present. Sclerotic serpiginous lesion within the left proximal humeral diaphysis is unchanged, possibly an enchondroma or bone infarct.
