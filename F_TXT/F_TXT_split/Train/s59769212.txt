The endotracheal tube has been pulled back and the distal tip is now appropriately sited, 3.3 cm above the carina at the level of the aortic knob. Nasogastric tube tip and side port are below the gastroesophageal junction. There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities throughout both lung fields, which are unchanged and can be due to multifocal pneumonia versus ARDS. No pneumothoraces are present.
