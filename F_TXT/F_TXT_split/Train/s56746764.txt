There is minor streaky opacification of the lung bases suggesting minor atelectasis. No definite consolidation is present. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A rounded dense 2.9 cm lesion projects over the right mediastinal border and is consistent with a relatively large but highly calcified mediastinal lymph node. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise normal.
