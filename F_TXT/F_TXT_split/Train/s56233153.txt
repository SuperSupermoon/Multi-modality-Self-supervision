As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 4.5 cm above the carinal. The right internal jugular vein catheter as well as the nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. The lung volumes have slightly increased, causing improvement of the pre-existing areas of basilar atelectasis. No pneumonia, no pneumothorax.
