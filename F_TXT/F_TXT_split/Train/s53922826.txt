CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 6.1 cm above the carina, at the levels of the upper clavicular heads. An NG tube is present, tip and side port beneath the diaphragm, with tip extending off film. A right IJ central line is present, tip at SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax is detected. Possible background hyperinflation. There is slight prominence of the hila, with a tapered appearance, raising the question of pulmonary hypertension. Allowing for technique, heart size is probably borderline or minimally enlarged. There is upper zone redistribution and mild prominence of interstitial markings. Given supine positioning, this is of indeterminate significance. No frank consolidation or effusion is identified. Compared with ___ at ___ p.m., I doubt significant interval change. Although the upper zone vessels are more pronounced, the prior film was obtained as an upright film, while the current study was obtained supine.
