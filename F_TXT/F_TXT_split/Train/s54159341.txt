The NG tube is still too high, with proximal port at the gastroesophageal junction. There continues to be moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular redistribution, bilateral effusions and hazy alveolar infiltrates, lower lobe greater than upper lobe. The overall impression is that of CHF. An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
