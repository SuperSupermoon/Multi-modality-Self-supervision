Portable semi erect frontal image of the chest. A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC. A tracheostomy tube is seen in place. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted. An additional catheter is seen overlying the abdomen. An opacity is seen in the left lung base, concerning for pneumonia. Increased mild opacity in the right mid lung may represent developing pulmonary edema. There is a moderate to large left pleural effusion and a moderate right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by adjacent opacities. Lucency is seen projecting over the mediastinum, which may represent air in the esophagus which would be concerning for a possible tracheoesophageal fistula.
