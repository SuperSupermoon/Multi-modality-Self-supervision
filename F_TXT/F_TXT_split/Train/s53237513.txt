There are no prior chest radiographs available for review. Uniform opacification at the base of the left lung is probably atelectasis, accompanied by small left pleural effusion. Atelectasis is also seen in the right middle lobe. Aspiration is not excluded, but is not suggested by these findings. Upper lungs clear. Heart size top-normal. No pneumothorax. Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC.
