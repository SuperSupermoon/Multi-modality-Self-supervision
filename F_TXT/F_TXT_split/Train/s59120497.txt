Lung volumes are low causing crowding of the central bronchovascular structures. The heart is normal in size given the low lung volumes. There is a right internal jugular central venous line which terminates in the proximal right atrium. An enteric tube terminates below the view of this radiograph. There is an endotracheal tube which terminates approximately 1.9 cm above the level the carina. Gaseous distention of bowel loops is noted in the upper abdomen.
