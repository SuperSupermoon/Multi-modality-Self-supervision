Endotracheal tube tip is 4.7 cm above the carina, orogastric tube ends into the stomach, Swan-Ganz catheter tip extends to the right main pulmonary artery, and two mediastinal drain tubes are seen approaching from the inferior aspect. Mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion and probably a small right pleural effusion, accompanying bibasal atelectasis, left side more than right, has not changed much since yesterday. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and postoperative mediastinum, which has an expected appearance, is stable. No acute changes in the chest.
