The patient is status post extubation. Bilateral lungs are remarkable for prominent vascular markings. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are slightly prominent. Pleural effusion if any is minimal on the left side. Comparison for changed or new appearance of left effusion could not be made with the previous radiograph because of the external devices obscuring the left lower lung and the costophrenic angle region.
