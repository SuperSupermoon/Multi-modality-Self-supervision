Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs are somewhat low in volume, with resultant mild basilar linear atelectasis. Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally is likely due to overlying soft tissues rather than pleural effusion. Mild cardiomegaly persists without overt edema. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable.
