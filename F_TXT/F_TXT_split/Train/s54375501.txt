Mildly decreased lung volumes. The patient continues to demonstrate several features of asthma, including peribronchial thickening and increased interstitial markings. However, upon review of numerous prior chest radiographs, there is no evidence of lung hyperexpansion at times when the pulmonary parenchyma appears most pathologic, mass making asthma an unlikely primary diagnosis. Additionally, there is an apparent focal airspace opacity overlying the left lower lobe. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Chronic, mild cardiomegaly. Slight differences in mediastinal contours are likely secondary to patient rotation.
