There is prominence in the region of the right hilum and infrahilar region. A PA and lateral film in the radiology department would be recommended when the patient is stable to better evaluate this finding. If this persists, then a dedicated chest CT would be recommended. There is no pneumothorax, effusion, consolidation or CHF.
