An ET tube is noted with tip approximately 3.7 cm above the carina in appropriate position. A feeding tube is noted to pass below the diaphragm with side holes and tip not clearly visualized. Study is limited by patient body habitus. Additionally, portions of the left hemithorax are excluded from the field of view. Within these limitations, bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of bronchovascular markings. Underpenetrated study limits evaluation for edema or focal consolidations. Cardiac silhouette appears accentuated by low lung volumes. No acute rib fractures are identified. If there is clinical concern for rib fractures, then a dedicated rib series can be obtained.
