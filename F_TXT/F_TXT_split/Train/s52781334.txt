The right pleural effusion is more pronounced than on the earlier study and obscures observation of the right base, and it would be difficult to exclude consolidation/ atelectasis in this region. There is cardiomegaly, upper zone redistribution and blurring of vascular detail suggesting CHF. There is no pneumothorax. The PICC line on the right is unchanged.
