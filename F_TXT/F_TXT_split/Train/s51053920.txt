Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Low lung volumes are present. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. New small right pleural effusion appears decreased in size compared to the prior study. Patchy opacities in the lung bases, more pronounced on the right, are not substantially changed in the interval, and likely reflect areas of atelectasis. Infection or aspiration in the right lung base however cannot be completely excluded. No pneumothorax is detected. Radiopaque focus projects over the right dome of the liver, perhaps a coil, unchanged.
