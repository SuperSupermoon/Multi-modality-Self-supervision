Endotracheal and enteric tubes, as well as a catheter projecting over the lower thoracic spine remain in unchanged positions. Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with leads in similar positions. The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, with coronary artery stenting noted. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Lung volumes are low, but slightly improved compared to the most recent previous study, with crowding of bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases are re- demonstrated, likely areas atelectasis as these findings were not present on the initial radiographs. No pneumothorax is present.
