As compared to the previous radiograph, the very extensive left-sided parenchymal and pleural changes are constant in appearance and distribution. On the right, however, the predominantly apical consolidations and opacities as well as the peribronchial right basal opacities all appear to have slightly increased in severity and extent. As noted on previous occasions, CT might be helpful to clarify the nature of these opacities. The size of the cardiac silhouette can no longer be reliably determined. No pneumothorax.
