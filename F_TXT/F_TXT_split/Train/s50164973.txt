One AP single chest view has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made to the next preceding similar study of ___. Findings are grossly unchanged demonstrating again markedly reduced lung volume in the left hemithorax with marked shift of the mediastinal structures towards the left, indicating volume reduction, probably caused by chronic infections with large bronchiectatic changes on the bases as well as in the apical left upper lobe area. The right lung is hyperinflated. A previous preoperative chest examination of ___ is reviewed, compared with today's findings. The dense bronchiectatic changes and scarring in the left hemithorax is grossly unaltered. When comparing the hyperinflated right lung, comparison demonstrates that there exists some new mostly linear changes in the right lung base that did not exist previously. Comparison with the next preceding single view chest examination of ___ demonstrates grossly unchanged findings as these linear densities existed already on the right base at that time.
