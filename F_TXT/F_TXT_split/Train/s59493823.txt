A left lateral chest tube remains in place. No pneumothorax. Feeding tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Persistent low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities and likely associated layering effusions. Findings suggest partial lower lobe compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No pulmonary edema.
