As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a massive increase in extent and severity of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities. The opacities are perihilar and symmetrical in distribution, very likely reflecting acute centralized pulmonary edema. This would be consistent by the increase in size of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
