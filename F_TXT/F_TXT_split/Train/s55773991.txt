Evaluation is very limited due to poor patient positioning and technique. The endotracheal tube terminates 5.5 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. There is increased opacification of the right lung base from a most recent prior study and worsening left basilar atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is seen without overt pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion is appreciated. The imaged cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits and unchanged.
