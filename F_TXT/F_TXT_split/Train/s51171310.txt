There are low lung volumes, resulting in bronchovascular crowding and exaggeration of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is pulmonary vascular engorgement, without frank edema. Increased bibasilar opacities are likely consistent with atelectasis, however pneumonia or aspiration could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. The heart remains enlarged. No pneumothorax.
