A right internal jugular venous catheter ends in the lower SVC, also unchanged. Lung volumes remain low. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are overall unchanged. The heart top-normal in size, unchanged. The right pleural effusion tracks into the minor fissure. The mediastinal and hilar contours are also unchanged. No pneumothorax. No obvious focal consolidation within the limitations of large pleural effusions.
