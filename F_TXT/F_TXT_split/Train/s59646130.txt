As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are constant. The lung volumes have minimally increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressure. Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis persists. The bilateral basal areas of parenchymal opacities are constant in appearance. No new parenchymal changes. No pneumothorax.
