A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval repositioning of the endotracheal tube, which now terminates in the mid thoracic trachea. A nasogastric tube again courses below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image. The remainder of the exam is unchanged, with patchy opacity at the right base which could represent a combination of pneumonia and vascular congestion.
