Lung volumes are low, and increased bronchovascular crowding may account for some of the apparent changes, but I think there is increasing pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema, accompanied by increase in moderate cardiomegaly. Pleural effusion is presumed, but not substantial. No pneumothorax.
