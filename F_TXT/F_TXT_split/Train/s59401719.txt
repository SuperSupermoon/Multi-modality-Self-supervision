Compared to ___ lung volumes have improved and mediastinal engorgement has decreased. This could be a function of increased positive pressure ventilation or improved hemodynamics. The most dense consolidation is still in the right upper lobe, but consolidation in the perihilar left lung which was nearly as dense, has improved. Differential diagnosis definitely includes asymmetric pulmonary edema, particularly with mitral regurgitation responsible for greater edema in the right upper lobe. It also includes noncardiogenic edema with or without concurrent pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage. New NG tube passes into the stomach and out of view, ET tube is in standard placement, new right jugular line ends in the upper SVC, with no associated mediastinal widening, new pleural thickening or effusion, or pneumothorax.
