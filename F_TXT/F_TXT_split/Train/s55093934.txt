Previous mild pulmonary edema has redistributed and improved. There is new atelectasis at the left base, conceivably due to splinting. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. The only visible rib fracture, left seventh posteriorly, is nondisplaced and there is no associated hematoma.
