In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular level, approximately 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube again extends well into the stomach. There are continued low lung volumes. The previous opacifications on the right are decreasing in extent and severity, consistent with improvement in pulmonary venous pressure. Poor definition of the right hemidiaphragm suggests pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
