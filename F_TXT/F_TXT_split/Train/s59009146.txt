As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices, including the left-sided chest tube, are in constant position. Also unchanged is the small left basal PICC line. The separation of the pleural layers is unchanged as compared to the previous examination, the change is indicative of a left pneumothorax. An additional, newly appeared linear structure paralleling the left lateral chest wall corresponds to a skinfold. No evidence of tension. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. No pulmonary edema. Unchanged minimal right pleural effusion.
