This is a very limited exam due to low lung volumes and obscuration of the apices by the patient's chin. There is a right-sided IJ whose tip is difficult to definitively visualize. Aside from bilateral atelectasis, the small visualized portion of the upper-to-mid lungs is unremarkable. No definite pneumothorax is identified. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
