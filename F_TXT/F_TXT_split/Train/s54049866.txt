Improved visualization of the right hemidiaphragm border with residual linear atelectasis of the right lower lung. No pneumothorax. Elevated right hemidiaphragm noted. Retrocardiac consolidation may be combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis but cannot exclude pneumonia. Probable small layering left pleural effusion. Cardio mediastinal contours unchanged. Achy ostomy seen.
