AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The pacemaker leads terminate in the right atrium, right ventricle and most likely left ventricular epicardial vein. As compared to the prior study, there is no change in the appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The bibasal linear opacities reflect areas of scarring. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen. Small amount of pleural effusion is present on the right.
