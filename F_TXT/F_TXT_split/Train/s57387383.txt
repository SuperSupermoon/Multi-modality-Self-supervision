An endotracheal tube is in place, approximately 6.6 cm from the carina. A feeding tube is seen with the tip and side port within the stomach. There is a subtle 1 mm new soft tissue contour adjacent to the calcification of the aortic knob which was not present on the prior radiograph, and is likely due to patient positioning. Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. New mild hazy opacity at the left base is present, which likely represents atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation.
