As compared to the previous radiograph, there is mild coarsening of the known left lower lobe parenchymal opacity, potentially reflecting pneumonia. The monitoring and support devices are unchanged, with the exception of the nasogastric tube that is now visible in its entire course, with the side-hole projecting approximately 5 cm be low the gastroesophageal junction. No pneumothorax. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No pulmonary edema.
