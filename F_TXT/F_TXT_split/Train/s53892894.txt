Again seen are multiple suture lines throughout the right lung, reflecting recent VATS. There is no pneumothorax. A small right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, suggestive of a small left pleural effusion. No superimposed focal consolidation is detected.
