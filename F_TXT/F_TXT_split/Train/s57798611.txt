Left PICC line tip terminates at the level of lower SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance but there is interval development of right basal atelectasis, that might represent worsening hypoxia. It may represent also a combination of atelectasis and infection. Minimal left basal atelectasis is new as well. There is no interval increase in pleural effusion or development of pneumothorax.
