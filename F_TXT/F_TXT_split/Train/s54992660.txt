Two chest tubes remain in good position. Increased opacification of the right lung likely due to either redistribution of right pleural effusion or slight worsening of the pleural effusion. Left pleural effusion is stable. The left basilar atelectasis is slightly improved, and the right basilar atelectasis is stable. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
