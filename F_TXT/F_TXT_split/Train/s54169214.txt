In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a pigtail catheter at the left base with removal of a large amount of free pleural fluid from the hemithorax. No evidence of pneumothorax. The opacification at the right base has substantially decreased. Although some of this may be clearing consolidation, there also appears to have been improvement in the pulmonary vascular status. Continued opacification adjacent to the aortic arch, consistent with prior radiation therapy.
