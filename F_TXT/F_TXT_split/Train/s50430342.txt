There is an ET tube, which is advanced too far and terminates at the origin of the left mainstem bronchus, with opacification of the left lung, which may represent atelectasis. Alternatively, the left lung opacification may represent pulmonary edema or layering pleural effusion. The right PICC line terminates in the distal SVC. There is a PA catheter and left chest tube, which appear in appropriate positioning. Although the image is severely rotated, the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.
