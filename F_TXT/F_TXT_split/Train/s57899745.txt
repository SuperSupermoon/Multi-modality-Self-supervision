A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube is low, ending 1.1 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube follows the expected course ending below the diaphragm, although the tip is not visualized. There is bibasilar atelectasis, more significant on the right. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
