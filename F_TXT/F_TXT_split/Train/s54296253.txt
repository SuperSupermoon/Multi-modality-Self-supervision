The endotracheal tube terminates. 4.1 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and terminates outside of the field of view within the stomach. Dense opacification of the right lung base with associated rightward mediastinal shift disc consistent with right lower lobe collapse. Granular opacification of the left mid lung corresponds to airspace opacity seen chest CT concerning for aspiration pneumonia. There is no left-sided pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Chain sutures project over the right wall of suggesting prior lobe wedge resection. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured by the right basilar opacity. The osseous structures are notable for partially evaluated severe degenerative change of the cervical spine. Known osseous metastatic disease is better evaluated on same day CT. The upper abdomen is unremarkable.
