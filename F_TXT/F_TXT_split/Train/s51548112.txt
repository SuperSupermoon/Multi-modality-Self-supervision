An endotracheal tube tip terminates at the thoracic inlet, approximately 5.2 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube tip and side port are both below the diaphragm, within the stomach. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is demonstrated. Aortic knob calcifications are present. Diffuse alveolar opacities are noted in both lungs, most reflective of moderate to severe pulmonary edema. There are likely trace bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. Retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis, though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
