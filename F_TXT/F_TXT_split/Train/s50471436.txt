There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, worse from ___. There is a small left and moderate right pleural effusions, unchanged. Overlying consolidation at the right lung base is presumably atelectasis, however, infection cannot be excluded. Heart size is difficult to assess with the ongoing parenchymal changes. Mediastinal contours and hilar structures are unremarkable. No pneumothorax.
