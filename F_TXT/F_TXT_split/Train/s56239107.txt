As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above the carina. The tube could be advanced by 1 cm. The very widespread and severe parenchymal opacities, diffusely distributed in both lungs, has further increase in radiodensity. There is unchanged evidence of moderate cardiomegaly with shape, potentially suggesting the presence of a pericardial effusion. An echocardiographic verification should be performed. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
