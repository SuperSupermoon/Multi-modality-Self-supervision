The endotracheal tube terminates in the mid trachea. There has been interval placement of an enteric tube although the tip appears to course out of the field of view of this exam. A superiorly projecting tube over the mediastinum is likely external to the patient given adjacent contiguous tubing. Multiple EKG leads are noted overlying the chest externally. No focal consolidations identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
