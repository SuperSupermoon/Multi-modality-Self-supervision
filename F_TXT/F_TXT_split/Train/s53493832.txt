Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is a left-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the mid SVC, stable. Heart size is enlarged but stable. There is a moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion with opacification of the right lung base. This is stable. There is also likely a small left-sided pleural effusion. No overt pulmonary edema is seen and the visualized left upper lung field is clear. There are degenerative changes of the right AC and glenohumeral joints with high-riding of the right humeral head suggestive of supraspinatus tendon rupture.
