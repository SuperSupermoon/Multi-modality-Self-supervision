Portable AP view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the most recent prior study. A new endotracheal tube ends 2-3 cm above the carina. Upper enteric tube ends within the stomach. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged. Increased opacity in the right upper lung could be due to aspiration or developing infection. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. Old right-sided rib fractures are noted.
