A right Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position with the tip terminating at the level of the cavoatrial junction. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Widespread extensive air space opacities with lower lobe predominance are redemonstrated. There is a moderate right pleural effusion silhouetting the right hemidiaphragm. No significant left pleural effusion is seen with a left pleural pigtail catheter in stable position compared to the most recent prior study. There is lucency at the left cardiophrenic angle compatible with a small left basilar pneumothorax seen on the prior chest CT of ___. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis is better appreciated on the prior chest CT. Overall, there is no substantial change from the most recent prior study.
