Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest shows low lung volumes and mild to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with adjacent atelectasis. Underlying infection cannot be completely excluded. Median sternotomy wires and Corevalve are in place. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. The pulmonary vessels are prominent and ill defined with hazy opacities bilaterally, compatible with pulmonary edema. Emphysematous changes are redemonstrated with scattered rounded lucencies throughout both upper lungs. There is no pneumothorax. The osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
