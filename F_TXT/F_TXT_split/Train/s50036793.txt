Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Slight blunting of the costophrenic angles likely relates to low lung volumes, although trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. Right perihilar opacity is seen, which could be due to underlying consolidation, prominent vasculature, underlying mass is not excluded. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation. Old right-sided rib fracture is again seen. Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
