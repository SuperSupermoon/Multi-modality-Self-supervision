A feeding tube with a weighted tip terminates in the stomach. A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The patient remains intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. The course of a left-sided PICC line is somewhat difficult to follow within the superior vena cava, but it seems to terminate in the superior vena cava. Aortic stents projecting along the arch and upper abdominal aorta are noted. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is persistent retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm. Parenchymal opacification is non-specific but most frequently due to atelectasis, particularly in this location. More patchy parenchymal opacities throughout each lung, appear unchanged.
