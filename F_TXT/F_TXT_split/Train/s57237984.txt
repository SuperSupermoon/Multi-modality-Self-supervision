Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The ET tube tip is approximately 3 cm above the carina. Heart size is enlarged. Mediastinum is widened, but there is no comparison to prior studies to suggest chronicity of this finding. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and linear atelectasis in the left mid and lower lung are noted.
