The endotracheal tube is in appropriate position approximately 4 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube passes inferiorly into the stomach out of view, with the side port overlying the expected location of the stomach. A right subclavian central venous catheter terminates at the estimated location of the superior cavoatrial junction. The lung volumes are lower. Chronic collapse of the left lower lobe is again noted due to overlying moderate pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. There is new heterogeneous opacification of the right lower lobe. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax. The pulmonary vascular markings are normal.
