AP chest read in conjunction with a chest CT dated ___: The ___ of the severely widened mediastinum are comparable to the appearance on chest CT six days ago. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion, but low lung volumes are very low making it difficult to exclude mild edema. I would recommend conventional chest radiographs when feasible. Small right pleural effusion may be present, but there is no indication of pneumothorax. Heart is top normal size.
