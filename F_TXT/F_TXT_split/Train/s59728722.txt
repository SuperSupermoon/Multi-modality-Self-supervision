The patient has had interval esophagectomy. The postoperative appearance of the mediastinum, including a right-sided ___ drain, mediastinal drain, and nasogastric tube, is unremarkable. A right pectoral power port terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. New perihilar haziness and mild peribronchial cuffing are probably due to mild pulmonary edema. New retrocardiac airspace opacification may be due to atelectasis or aspiration. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged.
