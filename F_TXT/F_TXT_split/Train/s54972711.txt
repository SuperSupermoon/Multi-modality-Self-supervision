A left-sided PICC line courses into the chest. Its tip is not well visualized but it appears to terminate in the left brachiocephalic vein, similar to prior findings. Partly visualized cervicothoracic fusion shows no definite change. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear state unchanged. An increasing opacity is noted in the left retrocardiac area with bronchograms. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs appear otherwise clear.
