Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. There continues to be a layering left effusion with patchy associated airspace opacity which could reflect compressive lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. A more subtle patchy opacity the right medial lung base is suggestive of atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Multiple left-sided rib deformities consistent with remote trauma.
