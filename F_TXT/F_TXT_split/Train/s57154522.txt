The lung volumes are low. Allowing for rotation, low lung volumes and AP portable technique, the cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged, including suspected mild cardiomegaly. The aortic arch is calcified. There is patchy left basilar opacity suggestive of minor atelectasis, but otherwise the lungs appear clear. Although difficult to entirely exclude, there is no definite evidence for pleural effusion.
