A left lateral approach chest tube remains in place within a loculated left pleural effusion, which is not appreciably changed. The right lung remains clear. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable. A cortical irregularity with step-off in the lateral rib cage at the level of the chest tube insertion site is due to an acute rib fracture. In addition, the side port of the chest tube is setting in the rib cage, which is suboptimal for drainage purposes.
