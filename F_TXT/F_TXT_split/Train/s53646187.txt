The patient remains intubated, with an endotracheal tube terminating approximately 3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach by at least 8 cm, its tip not visualized, lying below the confines of the film. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. The lung volumes are low. Allowing for differences in technique, there is persistent vague left perihilar and lower lung opacity that is probably attributable to minor atelectasis, but attention in followup is recommended.
