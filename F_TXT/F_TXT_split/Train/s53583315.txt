There are no prior chest radiographs available for review. Lung volumes are low exaggerating mild to moderate pulmonary edema and the caliber of the moderately widened upper mediastinum. Significance of mediastinal widening would depend upon clinical history, could be due to benign causes such as mediastinal vascular engorgement, fat deposition, and exceedingly low lung volumes. CT scanning would provide more information about the mediastinum particularly vascular structures. Heart size is top-normal. No appreciable pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. ET tube in standard placement. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
