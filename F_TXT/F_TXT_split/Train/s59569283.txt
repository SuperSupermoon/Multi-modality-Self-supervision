The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including mild cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration. There is again a poorly visualized substantial, possibly large, hiatal hernia with streaky left basilar opacification suggesting associated minor atelectasis. Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear. There are no definite pleural effusions. The bones appear demineralized. Thoracolumbar curvature appears stable with loss in height of one or more upper lumbar vertebral bodies, probably unchanged.
