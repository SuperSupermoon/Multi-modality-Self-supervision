A right central line terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There has been interval placement of an endogastric tube whose side port projects over the gastric bubble, well below the GE junction. The heart size is large, but stable compared to prior exams. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Again are seen multiple air space opacities, upper and lower portions of the right lung, but worsening in the retrocardiac space. Pulmonary edema has worsened. Blunting of both costophrenic angles suggests bilateral pleural effusions, with portions of fluid tracking along the right lateral pleural space. Assessment of pneumothorax is limited by the exclusion of the lung apices on this exam. A single distended loop of bowel is present below the diaphragm.
