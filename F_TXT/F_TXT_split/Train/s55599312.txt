1. Persistent right layering pleural effusion and smaller left effusion. Patchy right basilar opacity essentially stable. Interval improvement in aeration at the left base. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Heart remains enlarged, most likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded. Prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissues is most likely related to vascular structures which are exaggerated due to the patient's marked rotation on the current examination. No pneumothorax.
