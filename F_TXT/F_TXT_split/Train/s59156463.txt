Portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal and hilar contours. Rounded opacity projecting over the right heart border likely represents combination of rounded atelectasis and prominent pericardial fat pad evident on the ___ CT. Bibasilar atelectasis is evident. Minimal blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles likely due to small pleural effusions. The sideport of the NGT is at the GE junction.
