As compared to the previous image, the PICC line has been pulled back. The tip of the line now projects over the mid SVC. No evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. The known mid and lower lung opacities are unchanged in extent and severity. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No pleural effusions.
