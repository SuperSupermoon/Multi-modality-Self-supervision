1. Left basilar chest tube remains in place. Small left apical pneumothorax still persists but has decreased in size. A nasogastric tube is seen projecting over the stomach. A left subclavian central line is unchanged in position. Small layering bilateral effusions are again seen and there is patchy bibasilar airspace disease, unchanged, most likely reflecting atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Multiple bilateral rib fractures are again seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant are consistent with prior cholecystectomy.
