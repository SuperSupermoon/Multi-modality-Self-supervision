Patient is status post surgical fixation of left clavicular fracture. There is no pneumothorax. Right chest tube is in unchanged position. Bibasilar opacity is slightly more increased compared to 1 day prior, probably due to increased atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette is top normal size. Lung volumes are low. Subcutaneous emphysema is similar to prior. There is increased opacity around the left lung base where chest tube enters. Multiple left-sided rib fractures are again noted.
