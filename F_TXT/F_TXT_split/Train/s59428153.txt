As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Moderate fluid overload and low lung volumes and extensive areas of atelectasis, notably in the retrocardiac lung regions. Mediastinal widening, slightly exaggerated by the slight rotation of the patient. Nevertheless, change requires radiologic followup. In the interval, the patient has received a vertebral stabilization device in the cervical region. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
