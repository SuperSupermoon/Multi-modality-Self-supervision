Left PICC tip is at the junction of the left and right brachiocephalic veins. ET tube tip is approximately 2.9 cm above the carina. Side port of the NG tube is just below the GE junction, with the tip in the stomach. Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and cause bronchovascular crowding. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion is similar to prior. Retrocardiac atelectasis and silhouetting of the medial left hemidiaphragm are similar to prior. There is no pneumothorax. Borderline edema, left lung unchanged. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen. Heart is moderately enlarged. Trace pleural effusions, if any.
