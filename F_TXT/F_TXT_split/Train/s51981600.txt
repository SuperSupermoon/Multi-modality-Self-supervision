AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Moderate cardiomegaly has been present throughout, though today, there is no pulmonary edema. Consolidation in the left lower lobe has worsened, now obscuring nearly the entire diaphragmatic interface. Whether this is pneumonia or atelectasis is difficult to say since the appearance has been similar on many of the chest radiographs over the past 10 days. Small left pleural effusion may have developed, often seen with persistent lower lobe collapse. Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. No pneumothorax.
