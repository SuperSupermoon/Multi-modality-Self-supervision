Endotracheal tube terminates 3.8 cm from the carina. Enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach, and off the inferior borders of the film. Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the low SVC. Heart size is normal. The aorta markedly tortuous. Ill-defined alveolar opacities are noted in the the left lung base, right upper lobe, and right lung base, findings which may reflect multifocal pneumonia and/or asymmetric pulmonary edema. Hilar contours are prominent which could suggest underlying lymphadenopathy. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. High-density material seen within the collecting systems bilaterally likely reflective of contrast from previous CT exam.
