Lung volumes have improved since earlier in the day, but there is still moderate bilateral pleural effusion, greater on the left as well as bibasilar atelectasis, also worse on the left. Upper lungs are clear. Right supraclavicular dual channel hemodialysis catheter ends in the right atrium. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.
