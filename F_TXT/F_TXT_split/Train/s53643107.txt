Single AP image of the chest was reviewed. ET tube and enteric tubes are in standard position. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Linear opacities at both lung bases, left greater than right, may represent atelectasis. As the pulmonary vasculature is mildly prominent, these linear opacities may also represent a small amount of edema.
