AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Position of previously described HD catheter is unchanged. Previously existing PICC line has been removed. There is now increasing density on the left lung base obliterating the left-sided diaphragmatic contour and clouding of the mid portion of left hemithorax. Considering that patient is in semi-upright position tilting significantly backwards, the described density most likely indicates further progression of the on previous examination suspected beginning pleural effusion. A semi-circular line running parallel to the chest wall circumference in the upper portion of the left hemithorax represents a skinfold. It is traversed by vascular lungs structures and thus not indicative for a pneumothorax. There are also some densities of lesser degree on the right lung base.
