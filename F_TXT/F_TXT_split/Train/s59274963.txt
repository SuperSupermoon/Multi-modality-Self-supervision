Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. In the interval since the prior study, there has been development of a right basilar opacity felt to most likely represent pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis though underlying consolidation is not excluded. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation if/when patient able. Aside from minimal left basilar atelectasis, the left lung is clear. No evidence of left-sided pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The aorta is slightly tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
