A new pleural drainage catheter has been inserted in addition to the two pre-existing pleural catheters. Moderate-to-large partially loculated right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size. Small right apical pneumothorax is noted. Known juxtahilar right lung mass is again demonstrated as well as adjacent post-radiation changes. More confluent opacities involving portions of the right middle and right lower lobe have slightly worsened. Minimal interstitial edema within the left lung appears unchanged.
