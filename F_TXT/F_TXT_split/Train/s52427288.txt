No pneumothorax or change in the appearance of probable small residual right pleural effusion 05:00 today. PleurX catheter unchanged in intrathoracic course. Moderate left pleural effusion stable. Heart is top-normal size but pulmonary vasculature is engorged and some of the diffuse interstitial abnormality is probably acute edema. Nevertheless the remainder of the Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality and particularly right upper lobe consolidation are long-standing and raise the question of pulmonary drug toxicity.
