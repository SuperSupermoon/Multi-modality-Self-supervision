Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval decrease in a previously large left pleural effusion, with some residual fluid layering along the lateral chest wall. There is no evidence to suggest pneumothorax. Right pleural effusion with fissural loculation appears similar in configuration as compared to preceding exam. There is persistent plate-like atelectasis in the right lung base and in the left base retrocardiac region. Patient is status post esophagectomy with pullthrough, accounting for prominent right paramedian contour. Gaseous distention of bowel loops is redemonstrated under the diaphragm, similar as corroborated with preceding CT from three days ago.
