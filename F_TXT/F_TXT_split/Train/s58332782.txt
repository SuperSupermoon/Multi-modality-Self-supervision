1. Left-sided Port-A-Cath remains in place. There has been interval removal of a right basilar chest tube. There is a catheter overlying the base of the heart, presumably related to a recently placed pericardial drain for a pericardial effusion. There continues to be a right pleural effusion and soft tissue opacity in the right hilar and paratracheal areas, which could represent fluid which is layering dependently given patient's positioning on the study as well as in combination with a decrease in right lung aeration. The medial opacities also could represent tumor progression or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. The left lung remains grossly clear with the exception of some streaky and patchy opacities at the base which likely reflect atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult due to the right-sided opacities. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
