Comparison is made with prior study ___. ET tube tip now is in appropriate position, is approximately 5 cm from the carina. Allowing the difference in positioning of the patient, there has been interval increase in left lower lobe opacity consistent with increasing pleural effusion and atelectasis. Moderate right pleural effusion with large right lower lobe atelectasis is grossly unchanged. Cardiomegaly cannot be evaluated. The main pulmonary arteries are enlarged consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. There are no new lung abnormalities. ET tube tip is in the stomach.
