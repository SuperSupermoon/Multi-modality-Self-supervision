Right PIC line still passes into the right neck and out of view. Mild right basal atelectasis and small right pleural effusion, some loculated, are unchanged. With the patient rotated severely leftward, the mediastinum obscures the left lower lung which is probably atelectatic and makes it hard to assess how much if any residual left pleural effusion is present. Mediastinal contours are also difficult to discern, much less evaluate mediastinal contents. There is no left pneumothorax. Apical and basal pleural tubes are still in place.
