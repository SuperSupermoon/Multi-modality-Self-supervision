1. Left subclavian PICC line continues at its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Nasogastric tube does not appear to be changed in position with the tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach although the sideport may be near the gastroesophageal junction. Clinical correlation is advised. Interval appearance of streaky, patchy bibasilar and left mid lung opacities likely reflecting areas of atelectasis in the setting of diminished lung volumes. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large effusions. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac and medistinal contours are stable.
