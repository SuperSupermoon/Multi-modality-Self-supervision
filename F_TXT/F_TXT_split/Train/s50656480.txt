CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Lordotic positioning. There are low inspiratory volumes. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged. There is atelectasis at the left lung base, similar to ___. If there was high suspicion for a left lower lobe pneumonia, then further assessment with a lateral view would be recommended. There is upper zone redistribution, but given low lung volumes, I doubt overt CHF. Minimal atelectasis is seen at the right lung base. No gross effusion is detected on either side. Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is again noted.
