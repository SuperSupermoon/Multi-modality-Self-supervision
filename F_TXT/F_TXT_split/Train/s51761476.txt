CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW, SUPINE. A tracheostomy is in place. A Dobbhoff tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm, overlying expected site of the upper stomach. A right subclavian central line is present, tip over mid/lower SVC. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, suggesting interstitial edema. Plate-like atelectasis is noted at the left base. Right base atelectasis noted. No gross effusion. Compared with ___ at 12:39 p.m., the left lower lobe retrocardiac density is significantly progressed and the CHF findings also appear more pronounced.
