Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip 5.5 cm above the carinal. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below this diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. Left internal jugular central line, right internal jugular central line and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably enlarged. There are moderate to large bilateral layering pleural effusions and increasing perihilar fullness and vascular indistinctness suggestive of mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive lower lobe atelectasis given the effusions. No obvious pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
