Patient is slightly rotated. New pneumomediastinum is present with extensive subcutaneous emphysema tracking into the neck and chest wall bilaterally. Assessment for pneumothorax is somewhat limited given the presence of extensive subcutaneous emphysema, though no large pneumothorax is detected. Lung volumes remain low with coarse interstitial opacities noted diffusely compatible with history of severe fibrosing chronic lung disease. Heart size remains mildly enlarged with a small hiatal hernia again noted. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with crowding of bronchovascular structures and increased interstitial opacities compared to the previous chest radiograph suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no shift of mediastinal structures. Increased airspace opacities within the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. Retained barium is noted within multiple diverticula in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
