AP portable upright view of the chest. AICD is unchanged in position with leads extending to the region the right atrium and right ventricle. The lungs appear clear. Please note, recent chest CT findings of bilateral diffuse ground-glass pulmonary opacities are not reliably seen and were also radiographically occult on radiograph dated ___. Difficult to assess for interval change/resolution. No large effusion or pneumothorax. There is prominence of the main pulmonary artery outline which corresponds to a dilated main pulmonary artery on recent CT. Heart size is normal. Bony structures are intact. Chronic left sixth rib deformity is again noted. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
