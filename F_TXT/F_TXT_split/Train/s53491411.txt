There is a new right-sided PICC line with tip in the distal SVC. The heart size is mildly enlarged and the aorta is mildly tortuous. There are bilateral pleural effusions. There is alveolar infiltrate, right greater than left with dense consolidation in the right lower lobe. The areas of alveolar infiltrate include right upper lobe and left lower lobe. It is unclear how much of this is infectious or if there could be an element of fluid overload.
