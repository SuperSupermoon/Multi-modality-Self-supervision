Mediastinal widening is unchanged since the prior radiograph, and appears to correspond to mediastinal lipomatosis on prior CT of ___. Heart size is likely within normal limits allowing for extensive pericardial fat and accentuation by low lung volumes. As compared to the recent study, the left hemidiaphragm appears less distinct than on the prior exam. This could be due to small left pleural effusion, left basilar atelectasis, early infectious consolidation, or a combination of these entities. Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs with improved inspiratory level would be helpful for more complete assessment when the patient's condition permits.
