In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are stable. There are lower lung volumes. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with the clinical diagnosis of volume overload. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia or even ARDS could be considered. The hemidiaphragms are poorly seen with hazy opacification at the bases, consistent with layering pleural effusion and volume loss in the lower lobes, especially on the left.
