Left PICC tip terminates in the lower SVC, unchanged. Right-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium, unchanged. Tracheostomy tube tip remains in stable position. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Moderate cardiomegaly with a left ventricular predominance is again demonstrated. Atherosclerosis of the aortic knob is present and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is again noted. Perihilar and bibasilar alveolar opacities are relatively unchanged on the right, and slightly progressed on the left. These likely reflect a combination of moderate pulmonary edema and previously demonstrated multifocal pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. No pneumothorax is identified.
