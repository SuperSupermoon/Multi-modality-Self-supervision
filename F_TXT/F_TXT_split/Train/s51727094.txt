Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change. The patient is status post sternotomy, with a prosthetic valve. Again seen is mild cardiomegaly with a left ventricular configuration. The aorta is slightly unfolded, similar to the prior film. No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is identified.
