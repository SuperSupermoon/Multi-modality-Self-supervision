Semi-upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates no significant change in bibasilar opacities, likely representing atelectasis. Subpleural fat simulates a pleural effusion. The pulmonary vasculature is normal-appearing. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, notable for a prominent epicardial and mediastinal fat. An NG and feeding tube are seen to pass below the level of the diaphragm, though the tips are not appreciated. The tracheostomy tube and two central venous catheters are similarly positioned, with their tips in the upper SVC. A right axillary catheter is present, a left upper extremity PICC tip also passes into the upper SVC.
