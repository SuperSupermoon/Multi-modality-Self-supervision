AP chest compared to ___: Apical component of small left pneumothorax unchanged. There is probably also a basal component, difficult to assess. There is no right pneumothorax, small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed, apical pleural drains on each side. Upper enteric drainage tube traverses the neoesophagus ending at the diaphragm, as before. Right subclavian line ends in the right atrium. Consolidation is worsening in the right lower lung, extending to the level of the hilus. It is difficult to assess the other findings, with which one makes the diagnosis of heart failure, since the neoesophagus distorts the mediastinal silhouette. I suspect pulmonary edema is present as well as expected bibasilar atelectasis. Pneumoperitoneum reflects recent abdominal surgery.
