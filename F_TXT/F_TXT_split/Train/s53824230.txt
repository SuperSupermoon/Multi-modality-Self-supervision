Diffuse subcutaneous air has improved, and bilateral effusions have not changed. No pneumothorax is visualized on this radiograph. No focal consolidation is seen, and the reticular nodular pattern is unchanged and better assessed on recent CT scan. The tracheostomy tube ends in the distal trachea, and the cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
