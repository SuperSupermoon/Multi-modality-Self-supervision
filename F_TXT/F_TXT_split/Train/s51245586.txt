Single portable view of the chest. There are bilateral upper lung regions of consolidation, right worse than left. There is also opacity the right lung base obscuring the costophrenic angle potentially due to layering effusion. The cardiac silhouette appears slightly enlarged but likely accentuated by low inspiratory effort and portable technique. Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. Left chest wall dual lead pacing device seen. The bones appear diffusely osteopenic.
