ET tube is in unchanged position. Left PICC terminates in lower SVC. Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter terminates at the proximal right pulmonary artery. A transesophageal tube terminates in the stomach. A feeding tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view. Sternotomy wires are intact. Pulmonary edema is resolved in the right lung. Left lung pulmonary edema is persistent. Left lung base opacities increased, likely reflecting increased atelectasis and pleural effusion. Small right pleural effusion is stable. Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette is stable.
