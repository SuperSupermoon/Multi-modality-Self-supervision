AP view of the chest is reviewed. Tracheostomy tube is seen in standard position. There is a right PICC line with tip terminating in the distal SVC. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The previously seen left retrocardiac opacity has improved; however, there is still mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle. There is increased opacification of the right lung base. Additionally there are small scattered opacities in the left mid lung zone. The GJ tube is again seen.
