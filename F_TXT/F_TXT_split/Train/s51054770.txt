The apparent volume of previously large right pleural effusion has decreased. Heart size is normal. Equalization of pulmonary blood flow can be explained by supine positioning. Bibasilar atelectasis is relatively mild. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
