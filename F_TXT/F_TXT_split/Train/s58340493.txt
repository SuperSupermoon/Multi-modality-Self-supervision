As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal hyperlucency at the level of the left lung base, potentially representing an indirect sign for minimal post-procedural pneumothorax. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. No left pleural effusion, moderate right pleural effusion. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
