1. Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian central line remain unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given differences in patient rotation. There are heterogeneous patchy opacities in both lower lungs, which do not appear to be significantly changed, and therefore favor an infectious process or aspiration rather than atelectasis. No large effusions. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given a semi-supine technique. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
