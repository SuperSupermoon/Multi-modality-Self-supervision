An AP portable upright chest radiograph is lordotic in projection. Radiodense PICC line tubing is seen extending from the left with the tip at the level of the distal superior vena cava. The lungs appear clear. Apparent main pulmonary arterial calcification is caused by superimposition of mediastinal surgical clips.
