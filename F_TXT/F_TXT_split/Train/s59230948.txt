Since the prior study, there has been interval engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature and perihilar haziness, consistent with pulmonary edema. Atelectasis is noted at the lung bases bilaterally, slightly improved since the prior on the left. No focal pneumonia or pneumothorax is identified. The heart is normal in size. An enteric catheter is seen coursing through the esophagus, below the diaphragm and out of view.
