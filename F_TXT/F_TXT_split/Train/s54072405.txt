Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta remains tortuous. Calcified bilateral hilar mediastinal lymph nodes are re- demonstrated compatible prior granulomatous disease. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Bibasilar linear and patchy opacities may reflect areas of atelectasis. Chain sutures are noted in the right lung base compatible prior wedge resection. There is marked gaseous distention of colonic loops of bowel within the left upper quadrant resulting in left diaphragmatic elevation and atelectasis in the left lung base no pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities detected.
