A portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes resulting in exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Allowing for this, the heart is likely top normal in size. There is no appreciable pulmonary edema, effusion, or pneumothorax. Indistinctness of the right heart border raises concern for right middle lobe pneumonia. There is left lower lung atelectasis.
