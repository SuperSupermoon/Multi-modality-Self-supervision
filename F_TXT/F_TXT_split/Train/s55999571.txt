Compared with the earlier film, overall appearance is similar. Again seen is severe COPD with extensive parenchymal scarring. Known pneumomediastinum remains relatively subtle radiographically. Subcutaneous emphysema over the right supraclavicular region is now more apparent. Trace curvilinear lucency noted along the cardiac apex. No pneumothorax identified. No free air seen beneath the diaphgrams. Mediastinum remains midline.
