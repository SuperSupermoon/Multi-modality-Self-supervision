There is a small apical right pneumothorax following right chest tube removal. The tracheostomy tube is midline in appropriate position, and a left PICC line ends in the lower SVC. Increased opacification of the left hemithorax could be increasing layering pleural effusion. Multiple left lateral rib and clavicle fractures are again seen. The heart, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal.
