AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right chest tube is in place. The left Port-A-Cath catheter tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There is no substantial change in the right basal consolidation, but there is interval decrease in left pleural effusion, most likely related to the PleurX catheter placement, which is not definitely seen on the current examination. There is no pneumothorax, but there is interval development of interstitial pulmonary edema. Cardiomegaly is substantial. There is no possibility to exclude pericardial or pleural effusion.
