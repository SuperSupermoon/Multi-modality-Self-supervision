AP chest compared to ___, most recently 12:17 p.m.: Right apical component of pneumothorax is small. Basal component is hard to assess if any, but there has been appreciable reexpansion of the right lung following insertion of the pleural drain which terminates medially in the right lower chest, as before. Lung volumes are low, but I can still say there is no pulmonary edema or substantial atelectasis. Heart is normal size. Atrioventricular pacer leads in standard placements.
