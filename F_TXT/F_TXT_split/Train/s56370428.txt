There has been interval placement of a new right basilar chest tube with tip projecting along the mid right mediastinal contour. There is a continued moderate size right pleural effusion, perhaps slightly decreased in size compared to the previous study with continued right basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. Left lung remains clear. Heart size is moderately enlarged, and mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.
