Nasogastric tube tip terminates within the stomach. Heart size is normal. Aorta remains mildly tortuous and diffusely calcified. Hilar contours are stable. Chronic interstitial abnormality is demonstrated within the lung bases. Previously noted more focal opacities in the lung bases appear improved, likely reflective of resolved infection or inflammation. Emphysema is again seen. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified. Dilated loops of small bowel are noted within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
