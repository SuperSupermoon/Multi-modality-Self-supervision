In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube has been removed, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Other monitoring and support devices remain in place. There are lower lung volumes which accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vascular congestion. Focal atelectasis in the periphery of the right upper lobe is again seen, in the region of previous chest tube. Atelectatic changes persist at the bases with probable small pleural effusions bilaterally.
