Lung volumes are low, accentuating pulmonary vasculature. Despite this limitation, there is mild persistent pulmonary vascular congestion. Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged. An endotracheal tube tip terminates at the clavicular heads. A right internal jugular line is kinked in the subcutaneous tissues but the tip is in the mid SVC. A Dobbhoff tube loops in the stomach. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Mediastinal clips are in expected positions.
