Interval placement of a feeding tube with tip terminating in the body of the stomach adjacent to an indwelling nasogastric tube. Within the imaged portion of the neck, looping of the feeding tube is demonstrated and may be either internal or external to the patient. At the time of this report, a subsequently obtained radiograph following repositioning of the tube has been performed and is dictated separately under clip ___. With the exception of placement of the feeding tube, there has been little change in the appearance of the chest since the previous study of one day earlier, except for slight improvement in left basilar atelectasis and development of a new focus of patchy atelectasis at the right lung base.
