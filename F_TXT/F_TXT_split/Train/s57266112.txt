Portable AP chest radiograph. Left-sided Port-A-Cath and right-sided pleural pigtail drain are in stable position. There is no pneumothorax. Again noted is the right upper lobe consolidation, shown to be cavitating on yesterday's CT. Numerous focal opacities correspond to calcified pulmonary metastases. Left pleural effusion remains small.
