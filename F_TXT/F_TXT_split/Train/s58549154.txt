A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette and well-aerated lungs which are clear. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. There is no obvious intraperitoneal free air, although this does not appear to be an entirely upright radiograph, which limits evaluation. Gaseous distention of bowel is noted in the visualized upper abdomen. Lucency in the subcutaneous soft tissues is likely subcutaneous emphysema related to recent surgery.
