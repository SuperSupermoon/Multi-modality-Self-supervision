Bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with decreasing, very small right apicolateral pneumothorax, and slight increase in the size of a small left pneumothorax with both apical and basilar components. Improving left lower lobe atelectasis, with otherwise grossly clear lungs. Stable mediastinal widening and appearance of aortic stent graft. Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position except for apparent slight re-positioning of nasogastric tube with side port now just above the expected level of the GE junction.
