As compared to the previous radiograph, the vertebral stabilization devices are in unchanged position. The right PICC line has been removed. Most importantly, however, a new parenchymal opacity has appeared at the bases of the left lung. The opacities are alveolar in appearance and leads to blunting of the contour of the left hemidiaphragm. The opacity very likely reflects pneumonia. Pre-existing parenchymal opacity at the right lung base is more extensive than on the previous radiograph. There is blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, likely corresponding to a small right pleural effusion. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of fluid overload.
