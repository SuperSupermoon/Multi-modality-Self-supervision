AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and ___. Substantial hyperinflation is re-demonstrated, consistent with most likely presence of emphysema given the presence of the architectural distortion. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Left upper lung nodular opacities are seen, unchanged since ___, one of them corresponding to bone island.
