The ET tube terminates approximately 5.1 cm above the carina. A right-sided IJ terminates in the mid SVC. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip likely in the body of the stomach. There is mild cardiomegaly. The aorta is tortuous, otherwise the hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Chain sutures are seen along the medial right hemithorax. There may be small bilateral pleural effusions. Mild bibasilar atelectasis with bronchiectasis predominantly at the right lung base is seen. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
