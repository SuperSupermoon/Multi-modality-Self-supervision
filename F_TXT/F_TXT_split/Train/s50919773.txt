As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The lung volumes are increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung basis and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, unchanged as compared to the previous examination. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions.
