As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The right typically predominant parenchymal opacity, seen to a lesser extent at the right lung basis and at the left lung bases, is not substantially changed. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette persists. Unchanged mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
