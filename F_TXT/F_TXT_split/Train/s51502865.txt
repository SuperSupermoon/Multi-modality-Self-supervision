Interval removal of the endotracheal tube, right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, mediastinal drains, left-sided chest tubes, and nasogastric tube in this patient status post median sternotomy for CABG and aortic valve replacement. 2. Bibasilar patchy airspace opacity, left greater than right, likely reflects a combination of patchy atelectasis and pleural fluid. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Relatively low lung volumes.
