AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lungs are low in volume and severely affected by diffuse infiltrative abnormality which by virtue of its homogeneous distribution is more likely edema than anything else though not necessarily cardiogenic. Heart shadow is largely obscured, and pulmonary vessels cannot be assessed. Pleural effusions may be present but not large. Clinical service is aware of these findings.
