NG tube is present. The side port ends at or just below the gastroesophageal junction. The tube could safely be advanced 5-7 cm for positioning of the side port within the stomach. The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable. A small amount of free air is seen beneath the right hemidiaphragm, consistent with recent surgery.
