Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and a bilateral asymmetrical pattern of perihilar and basilar opacities, left greater than right. This could reflect asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but other superimposed process such as infection or aspiration should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Moderate left pleural effusion is not appreciably changed.
