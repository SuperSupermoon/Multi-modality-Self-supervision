Small left apical pneumothorax, small left basal pleural effusion, and severe left lower lobe atelectasis have not improved. Left pleural drain in place. Right lung is clear. The heart is normal size but shifted slightly into the left chest reflecting the lower lobe atelectasis. A right subclavian infusion port ends in the mid to low SVC.
