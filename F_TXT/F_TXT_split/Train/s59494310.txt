AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding semi-upright portable chest examination obtained nine hours earlier during the same day. The patient remains intubated. In comparison with the previous study, however, tip of the ETT has changed its position slightly and is now only 2 cm above the level of the carina. It does not obstruct either the right or left-sided airways. The position of the previously described right internal jugular approach central venous line is unchanged, seen to terminate in the lower third of the SVC. No pneumothorax has developed. Previously described moderate cardiomegaly remains unchanged and the same holds for the pulmonary congestive pattern with significant perivascular haze both sides. The finding is compatible with pulmonary venous congestion. Diffuse haze mostly over the basal portions may be related to some pleural effusion layering in the posterior pleural compartments. The patient is examined in supine position. So called clear view copy of the image demonstrates appropriate position of the NG tube reaching well below the diaphragm. No new parenchymal infiltrates can be identified on this portable supine chest examination. There are multiple external wires and electrodes overlying the chest.
