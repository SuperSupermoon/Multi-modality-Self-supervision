New consolidation in the right lower lung. Because the right heart border is preserved I suspect this is in the postoperative right lower lobe, following segmentectomy. There is no right pneumothorax. Small right pleural effusion is new or newly apparent, right pleural drain still in place. Left lower lobe atelectasis is severe, progressed since ___. Left upper lung is grossly clear. Heart is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal veins are borderline engorged but there is no pulmonary edema.
