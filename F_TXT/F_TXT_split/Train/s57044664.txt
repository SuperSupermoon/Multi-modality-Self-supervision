A left-sided nerve stimulator device is noted with lead coursing cephalad into the left neck. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Streaky opacities in the lung bases are most likely reflective of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Deformity of right distal clavicle is compatible with prior injury.
