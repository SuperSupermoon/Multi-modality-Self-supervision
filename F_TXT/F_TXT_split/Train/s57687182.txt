There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter whose tip extends to the cavoatrial junction. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2 cm from the carina. Left apical and left basal chest tubes are present. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is again noted, which limits evaluation of the underlying lung parenchyma. A persisting left pneumothorax is suspected. There has been slight increase in opacification of the right lung base.
