IMPRESSION; Following thoracocentesis, moderate-to-large left pleural effusion has substantially resolved with minimal residual effusion. Bilateral lung volumes are low. Given the temporal development, new airspace opacities in the left lung and focal opacity in the right upper lobe are attributed to re-expansion edema (Reference- Reexpansion pulmonary edema CT findings in 22 patients. ___ et al, J Thorac Imaging ___;26:___). No evidence of pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion on the right side. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal and stable.
