There are no prior chest radiographs available for review. Heterogeneous but asymmetric pulmonary opacification looks like dense consolidation in the left lung and interstitial abnormality in the right. This could mean combination of pulmonary edema and left lung pneumonia. Heart however is normal size, and pleural effusion is moderate on the left, not apparent on the right. No pneumothorax. Right central venous infusion catheter ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. More extensive background and current clinical findings would be helpful in generating a more specific interpretation.
