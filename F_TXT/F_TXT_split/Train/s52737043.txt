Tracheostomy again seen. A right subclavian PICC line tip overlies the SVC/RA junction. Right-sided chest tube again present. Compared to the prior film, I doubt significant interval change. Residual contrast noted in the gastric fundus which lies above the level of the left hemidiaphragm. Small right effusion is better seen on today's chest x-ray. Minimal patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region is slightly more pronounced. Right upper zone opacity is similar to the prior film. Increased retrocardiac opacity is also similar. The lateral left hemidiaphragm and costophrenic sulcus are excluded from the current film.
