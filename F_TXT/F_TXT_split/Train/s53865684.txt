A right PICC line can be traced to the level of the low SVC. Lung volumes are low. A small left pleural effusion has slightly increased. Stable left basilar retrocardiac airspace opacification is most likely due to atelectasis. The upper lung fields are clear. There is no pneumothorax. The heart mediastinum cannot be accurately assessed on this projection.
