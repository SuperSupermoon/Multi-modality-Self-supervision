ET tube tip is approximately 2.3 cm above the carina, similar to prior CT. Right jugular venous line tip is near the junction of the right and left brachiocephalic veins, similar to prior. Left PICC tip is near the SVC/RA junction. 2 enteric tubes course into the stomach and out of view. Lung volumes are even lower compared to prior, causing accentuation of the cardiac silhouette as well as bronchovascular crowding. Retrocardiac opacity is similar to prior. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Imaged osseous structures are intact.
