AP chest compared to ___: Large left pleural effusion is smaller and mediastinum has returned nearly to the midline following insertion of the left pleural drain. Aeration in the left lung has not improved. No obvious pneumothorax. Greater interstitial nodulation in the right lung is probably a combination of disseminated tumor and mild edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette partially obscured is roughly unchanged.
