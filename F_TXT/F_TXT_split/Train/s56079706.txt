As compared to the previous radiograph, the PICC line has been replaced in the interval. Right-sided PICC line shows a normal course, the tip projects over the cavoatrial junction. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, unchanged radiograph with borderline size of the cardiac silhouette and calcified granuloma at the right lung base.
