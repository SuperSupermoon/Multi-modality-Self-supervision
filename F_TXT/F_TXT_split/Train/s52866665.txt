Since the prior study, the endotracheal tube has been removed and the lungs remain inflated well. There are new linear areas of atelectasis with the left midlung but otherwise the lungs are similar in appearance with right basilar atelectasis. Right jugular central venous catheter has its tip in the lower SVC, as before. NG tube has its tip within the body of the stomach.
