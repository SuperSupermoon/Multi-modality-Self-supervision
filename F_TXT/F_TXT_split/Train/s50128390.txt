There are low lung volumes, which accentuate bronchovascular markings. Mild bibasilar opacities may be due to combination of low lung volumes and atelectasis, but aspiration or pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Again seen linear scarring in the right right mid and lower lung. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
