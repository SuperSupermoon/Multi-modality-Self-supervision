Portable AP supine chest radiograph obtained. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located about 2.9 cm above the carina. The NG tube courses into the left upper quadrant. Scattered pulmonary opacities could represent atelectasis, though a component of aspiration not excluded. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. Bony structures appear intact.
