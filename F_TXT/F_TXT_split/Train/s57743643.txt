As compared to the previous radiograph, the feeding tube has been removed. The patient continues to carry a left-sided PICC line. This line, however, has been pulled back and the tip is not projecting over the left subclavian vein. The lung volumes are very low, resulting in crowding of the vascular and bronchial structures at the lung bases and in the perihilar areas, similar to the previous examination. However, there is no evidence for a new parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia. No overt pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly. No pleural effusions.
