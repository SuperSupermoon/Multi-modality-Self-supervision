Compared to ___ at 01:27. New nasogastric drainage tube ends in the distal stomach. ET tube in standard placement. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions unchanged. No pneumothorax. Some of the opacification in the lower lungs is persistent dependent pulmonary edema, restricted to the lower lungs because of severe emphysema. Additionally, substantial right lower lobe atelectasis is presumed, and there is progressive consolidation in the left lower lobe which could be atelectasis alone but raises question of pneumonia particularly due to aspiration.
