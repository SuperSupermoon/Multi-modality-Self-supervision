The endotracheal tube and NG tube have been removed. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed and there continues to be a right IJ Cordis with tip in the SVC. There is dense retrocardiac opacity, consistent with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. There continues to be alveolar infiltrate in the left mid lung and right lower lung with some interval partial clearing of the upper lobes. The heart is severely enlarged and is slightly larger than on the prior study. The overall impression is that of CHF that is better in some areas and worsened in others.
