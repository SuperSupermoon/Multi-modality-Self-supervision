In comparison with the study ___ ___, the patient has taken a much better inspiration. There has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4 cm above the carinal. Nasogastric tube extends at least to the lower body of the stomach. There is increased opacification at the right base. Although this could merely reflect atelectasis and small effusion, in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. At the left base, there are less prominent atelectatic changes.
