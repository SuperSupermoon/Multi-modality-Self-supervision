Single frontal supine view of the chest was obtained. Detailed evaluation is limited by overlying trauma board and numerous overlying external medical devices. An endotracheal tube terminates in the proximal left main stem bronchus. The right lung is atelectatic with an elevated right hemidiaphragm, likely related to ET tube position. Low lung volumes exaggerate the heart size. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Multiple likely acute bilateral rib fractures.
