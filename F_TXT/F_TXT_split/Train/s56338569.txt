Compared with earlier the same day, the IABP has been pulled back and now lies slightly below the inferior rim of the aortic knob (the inferior edge of the right thumb is indistinct due to rotation, which limits precise measurement). Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Vascular markings are more pronounced than on ___, but similar to earlier the same day --___ could reflect CHF. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is probably unchanged. No left effusion identified. Probable bibasilar atelectasis, similar to prior. No pneumothorax is detected.
