There has been further improvement in previously present complete left lung collapse, with residual atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion appears slightly decreased compared to the prior study. Right lung is slightly overexpanded but grossly clear except for linear atelectasis at the right base.
