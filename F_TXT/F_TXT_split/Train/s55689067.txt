Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The exam was obtained in the relative AP lordotic view position. Subtle right mid lung opacity may be artifactual; however, underlying consolidation or ground-glass opacity is not excluded. Suggest repeat PA and lateral views for better evaluation. There is minor basilar atelectasis. No pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac silhouette appears relatively globular in configuration. Underlying pericardial effusion is not excluded. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. No large pleural effusion is seen, although trace right pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
