AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. During the interval, the left-sided PICC line has been removed. No pneumothorax can be identified in the apical area. As on previous examination, there is moderate cardiomegaly and a pulmonary congestive pattern with upper zone redistribution, interstitial edema on the bases and bilateral pleural effusions, slightly more on the right than the left. These findings are unchanged. No new infiltrates are seen. No pneumothorax has developed.
