A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right chest wall AICD/ pacer device with leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle. The cardiac silhouette is accentuated by mildly low lung volumes and technique, again appearing mildly enlarged. There is no appreciable focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
