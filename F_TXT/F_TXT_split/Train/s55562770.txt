In comparison with the CT angiogram, there is worsening opacity throughout the right lung, which may reflect aspiration, hemorrhage, or asymmetric pulmonary edema superimposed on numerous pulmonary nodules. Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is seen. Blunting of the costophrenic angle on the left is consistent with pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis. Multiple pulmonary nodules are seen in the left upper lung.
