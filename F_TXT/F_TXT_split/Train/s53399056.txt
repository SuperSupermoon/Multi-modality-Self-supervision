As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of cardiomegaly, moderate left pleural effusion and subsequent left basal atelectasis. At the right base, the lung is less transparent and shows a focal zone of increased density. This area, however, could represent atelectasis, given that the lung volumes have decreased. Exclude early pneumonia, however, short-term radiographic followup should be performed. Mild fluid overload. No evidence of pneumothorax.
