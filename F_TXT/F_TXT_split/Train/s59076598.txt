As compared to the previous radiograph, the old feeding tube has been removed and a new Dobbhoff catheter has been inserted. The catheter is malpositioned, folding back on itself and with its tip pointing upward the esophagus. The tip is currently projecting over the middle parts of the esophagus. Tube requires repositioning. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, unchanged chest radiograph.
