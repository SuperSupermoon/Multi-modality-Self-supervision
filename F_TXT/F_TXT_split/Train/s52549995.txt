Right pleural catheter has slightly changed in position compared to the prior study, but there is no substantial change in a small right pleural effusion. Multifocal cavitary lung lesions are again demonstrated as well as superimposed areas of consolidation in the mid and lower lungs. Interval abrupt worsening of opacity in the left lower lobe retrocardiac area could reflect worsening consolidation or superimposed atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
