The patient is intubated. The carina is difficult to discern but the endotracheal tube probably terminates about 2.5 cm above it. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, terminating in the antrum to the right of midline. Lung volumes are low. Allowing for technique, the cardiac and mediastinal and hilar contours appear unremarkable. There is mild perihilar fullness bilaterally which is suggestive of venous hypertension. Vague density at the left lung base makes it difficult to exclude the possibility of a developing opacity there, which would most commonly be due to atelectasis.
