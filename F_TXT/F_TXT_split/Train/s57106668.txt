The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. There is patchy opacification of the left lung base, probably including a small pleural effusion. Suspected parenchymal opacity is not specific and could be seen with atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration. Elsewhere, the lungs appear clear. There is no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
