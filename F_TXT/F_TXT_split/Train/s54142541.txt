Single portable upright AP film. The patient is status post right upper lobectomy with redemonstration of volume loss in the right lung and rightward shift of mediastinal structures. Emphysematous changes are again seen. Pleural thickening along the right apicolateral chest is unchanged from the recent prior radiograph. New mild pulmonary edema is seen with vascular indistinctness. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted, new on the left, and increased size on the right compared to the prior radiograph. Bibasilar opacities are seen, which likely reflect atelectasis, but cannot exclude infection. Right hilar fullness is again noted, which reflects a prominent right pulmonary artery and adjacent lymphadenopathy. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise stable from prior exam. There is no pneumothorax. Several clips project over the upper thoracic spine and right lateral apex.
