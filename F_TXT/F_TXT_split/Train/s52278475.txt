As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. Lung volumes have minimally decreased, potentially reflecting reduced ventilatory pressure. There is unchanged evidence of relatively extensive right basal and retrocardiac atelectasis and of mild pulmonary edema. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant. No other relevant changes.
