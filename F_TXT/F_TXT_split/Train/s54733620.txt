In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been removed. The jugular catheters remain in place. There is extensive hazy opacification on the right, consistent with large layering pleural effusion with extension along the right lateral chest wall. Less prominent hazy opacification is seen on the left. Compressive atelectasis is present at both bases. Pulmonary vascularity is extremely difficult to assess, though some engorgement suggests elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
