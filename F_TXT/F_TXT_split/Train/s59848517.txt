Comparison is made with the prior study ___. Cardiac size is normal. There are persistent low lung volumes. ET tube is seen in standard position. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right PICC tip is in the low SVC. There is no pneumothorax or enlarging effusions. Bibasilar opacities have improved on the right, worsened on the left. This could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
