CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. Allowing for this, the possibility of mild cardiomegaly cannot be excluded. No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is detected. No pneumothorax is identified. No displaced rib fracture is detected on this lung-technique film. Compared with ___ and allowing for differences in technique, I doubt significant interval change.
