There has been interval placement of right-sided pigtail catheter projecting over the right mid thorax. There is now a small residual pneumothorax identified at the right lung apex. Otherwise, there is no change. Left apical calcified granuloma is better seen on the current exam. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Right posterior ninth rib fracture is old as is a left posterolateral ninth rib fracture.
