Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes likely secondary to poor inspiration. There has been interval removal of a right IJ central line and the chest tube overlying the heart shadow. There is no pneumothorax or other complication seen. Pigtail chest tube remains in appropriate position in the left chest. Right PICC line is unchanged from prior exam. There is interval improvement in the left pleural effusion. The lungs are otherwise clear. Cardiac silhouette is unchanged in size.
