The patient is rotated towards the left. Endotracheal tube terminates 6.2 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach. Mild cardiomegaly is noted. Calcifications are seen at the aortic arch. Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Consolidation of the left lung base likely represents atelectasis. Opacity at the medial right lung base may be secondary to rotation, although infection/aspiration at this site is not excluded. There is no pneumothorax identified.
