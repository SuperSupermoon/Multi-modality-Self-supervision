Since the prior study, there is substantial interval progression of multifocal consolidations, in particular in the right upper and right lower lobe, currently more dense and confluent. The left upper and lower lobe have increased in consolidations and in the opacities as well. Part of it might reflect pulmonary edema, but the consolidative nature and density as well as asymmetric appearance are more in favor of infectious process. The ET tube tip terminates approximately 6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in the stomach. The pacemaker defibrillator leads terminate in the right ventricle. The IVC filter is seen.
