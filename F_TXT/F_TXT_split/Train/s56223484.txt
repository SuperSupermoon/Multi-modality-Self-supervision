AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-erect position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained on the morning of the preceding day ___. On the present portable examination, the patient is more rotated to the right as on the preceding examination. Again noted is significant cardiac enlargement and presence of surgical clips in the left-sided mediastinal structures compatible with previous bypass surgery. Absence of the usual sternal wires is noted. The grid-shaped structures of a CoreValve device are again identified and occupy the area of the left ventricular outflow tract and the root of the aorta. These structures are in unchanged position in comparison with the previous study. Comparison of pulmonary vasculature suggests that vascular distention and perivascular haze is less marked than it was on the preceding study. Again noted are relatively high positioned diaphragms indicative of poor inspirational mechanics. No pneumothorax can be seen.
