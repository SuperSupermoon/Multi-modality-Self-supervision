As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is outside of the image, but the sidehole is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. There is otherwise unchanged appearance of the thorax and no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. In the interval, the patient has received a vertebral fixation device.
