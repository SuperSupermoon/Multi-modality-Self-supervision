AP chest compared to ___, 4:28 p.m.: Moderate right pneumothorax has increased, particularly the basal component, since ___, following the placement of a right pleural tube. There is also new consolidation in the right lower lung. This could be a variant on post-reexpansion edema if negative pressure is being applied. Failure of the tube to drain the right pneumothorax may mean that it has been placed in the major fissure: Tiny left apical pneumothorax unchanged, left pleural drain in place. Stable widening of the postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is responsible for rightward displacement of the trachea, so that the endotracheal tube, at the proper height, abuts the left tracheal wall. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced at least 10 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction. No appreciable pleural effusion is present. These findings were discussed with respect to the subsequent chest radiograph performed 7:34 a.m., with Dr ___ at 8:45 a.m., in response to my page to ___ at 7:45 a.m. as soon as the subsequent radiograph came to my attention.
