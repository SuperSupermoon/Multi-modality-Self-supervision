Film obtained without and penetrated technique, limiting assessment of fine detail.Lung volumes are slightly low. Allowing for this, an endotracheal tube ends the mid thoracic trachea, approximately 3.6 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm to overlie the expected site of the gastric fundus. There is no focal consolidation. Prominence of the right superior mediastinum is again seen. Equivocal faint opacity at the right lung apex, unchanged compared with the previous film. No supine film evidence pneumothorax is detected. As before, there is prominence of the paraspinal lines, most notably about the lower thoracic spine.
