AP chest compared to ___: The generalized pulmonary abnormality has improved substantially since ___ indicating that the radiographic worsening after ___ was due to pulmonary edema although heart has consistenly been normal size. There are areas of lung which, however, remains substantially consolidated, specifically the right infrahilar and left suprahilar regions and a small region in the right apex. I cannot say whether these are asymmetric edema or pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion persists, and I presume an equivalent volume is present on the right.
