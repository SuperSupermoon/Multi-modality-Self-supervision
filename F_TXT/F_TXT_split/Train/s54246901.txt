There are low inspiratory volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, with sternotomy wires noted, is prominent, but probably unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, diffuse vascular blurring, with interstitial edema, consistent with CHF. This could be very slightly improved. However, there is new right base opacity and new obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm. Although not fully characterized, the appearance is compatible with a small effusion underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Small left effusion is again noted.
