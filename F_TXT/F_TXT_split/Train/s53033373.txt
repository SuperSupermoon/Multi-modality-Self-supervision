Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged. Aortic knob is calcified. Leftward tracheal deviation with fullness of the right superior mediastinal border may be due to the presence of the thyroid nodule or goiter. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
