AP upright chest radiograph was obtained. Pleural thickening and atelectasis at the right lung base is better assessed on the prior CT abdomen and pelvis. There are calcified granulomas scattered throughout both lungs. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is a prominent right epicardial fat pad which obscures the right heart border better seen on prior CT. Heart size is grossly within normal limits though better assessed on the outside hospital CT. Mediastinal contour likely reflects vascular ectasia. Bony structures appear intact.
