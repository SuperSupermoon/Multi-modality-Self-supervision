In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there are lower lung volumes. Bibasilar opacification is again consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis at the bases. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. No evidence of pneumothorax. Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
