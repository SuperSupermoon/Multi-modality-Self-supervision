The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable consistent with moderate to severe global cardiomegaly. There is a heavily calcified thoracic aorta. The hila are within normal limits. Diffuse pulmonary interstitial prominence is suggestive of sequelae of chronic pulmonary edema, mild on the current study. There is no large pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. There is diffuse subjective osseous demineralization. Vascular calcifications are seen at the base of the neck.
