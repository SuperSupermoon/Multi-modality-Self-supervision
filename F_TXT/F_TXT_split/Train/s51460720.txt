As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Moderate pulmonary edema with some degree of interstitial components. Isolated left pleural effusion is reflected by blunting of the left costophrenic sinus. As previously noted, pericardial effusion might be one of the explaining factors for this change. The patient shows sternal wires in unchanged alignment and a left pectoral Port-A-Cath. No pneumonia, no pneumothorax.
