In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes that most likely account for the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with possible slight elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Minimal atelectatic changes. The prominence in the right paratracheal region is less pronounced than on the prior study. Tracheostomy tube is in place without evidence of complication and with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.
