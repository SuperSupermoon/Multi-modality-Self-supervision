In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there are relatively low lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. No definite vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. Tortuosity of the aorta is again seen. Partial eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is less prominent on the current study.
