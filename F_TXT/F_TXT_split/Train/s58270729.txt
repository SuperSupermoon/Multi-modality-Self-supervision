Comparison is made to prior study performed four hours earlier. The endotracheal tube has been pulled back and the tip is no longer within the right main stem bronchus and is 2 cm above the carina. The right IJ central venous line has the distal lead tip in the right atrium and again this could be pulled back 3-4 cm for more optimal placement. The orogastric tube tip and side port are within the fundus of the stomach. Biliary stent projects over the right upper abdomen. There are bilateral pleural effusions and the right side has increased slightly. There is persistent moderate pulmonary edema. There is unchanged cardiomegaly. A left retrocardiac opacity is present; likely due to atelectasis and pleural fluid. No pneumothoraces are identified.
