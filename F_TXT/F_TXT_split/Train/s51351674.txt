ET tube tip is currently at adjusted, terminating 4 cm above the carinal. Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of the right atrium still and should be pulled back approximately 1.5 cm. Left middle lower lung opacities are still present, in should be reassessed on the subsequent study since might potentially still represent atelectasis of previous 1 lung (right) intubation. Small amount of left pleural effusion is probably present.
