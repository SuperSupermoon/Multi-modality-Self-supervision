Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Indistinctness and prominence of the hila suggests fluid overload along with perihilar opacities. Bibasilar opacity likely relates to fluid overload and low lung volumes, although a focal consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded. No large pleural effusions are seen, although trace pleural effusions will be difficult to exclude. Multiple mediastinal surgical clips are seen. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, similar to prior.
