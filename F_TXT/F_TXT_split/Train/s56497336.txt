Single AP frontal view of the chest was obtained. Minimal retrocardiac opacity is most likely due to atelectasis in the setting of low lung volume. Underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration is not excluded. Consider dedicated PA and lateral views if patient able for further evaluation. Increased interstitial markings consistent with patient's known interstitial lung disease are grossly stable. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Cardiac silhouette appears slightly more prominent compared to the prior study, although this can be due to differences in inspiration and position.
