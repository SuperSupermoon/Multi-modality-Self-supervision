A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates intact sternal wires, a valvular prosthesis, tracheostomy tube terminating in the upper trachea, and right subclavian central catheter terminating in the right atrium, all unchanged. There are low lung volumes resulting in exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Even allowing for this, there is at least mild to moderate cardiomegaly. Mild pulmonary edema is improved compared to chest radiograph from the day prior. Retrocardiac opacity may be due to left lower lobe volume loss, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. This is similar in appearance. Likely small left pleural effusion. No appreciable pneumothorax.
