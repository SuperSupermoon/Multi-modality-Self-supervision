Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. There is moderate-large right pleural effusion, which has increased since ___ exam. Left costophrenic angle is blunted, suggestive of small pleural effusion. There is perihilar vascular congestion. Cardiac size is difficult to assess due to adjacent opacities, which is likely enlarged. Aortic arch calcifications are again noted. Biapical scarring persists. There is no pneumothorax. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
