As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube was removed. The tip of the right internal jugular vein catheter currently projects over the upper parts of the right atrium. As expected, the lung volumes have decreased and signs of mild fluid overload are seen. However, there is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. No pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly.
