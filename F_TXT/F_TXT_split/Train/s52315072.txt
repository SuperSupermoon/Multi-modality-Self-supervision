Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There is no evident pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with mild cardiomegaly. Left lower lobe opacity, a combination of small left pleural and atelectasis, is grossly unchanged. Left perihilar opacities are likely atelectases. Multiple left rib fractures are again noted.
