Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained on ___ at 12:14 p.m. The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach.

Bibasal atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Small amount of left pleural effusion is unchanged and substantial left retrocardiac opacity most likely reflecting atelectasis is unchanged as well. There is no pneumothorax.
