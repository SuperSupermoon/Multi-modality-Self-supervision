AP chest read in conjunction with torso CT on ___, most recent prior chest radiograph, ___: Left lower lobe is collapsed, and there is at least a moderate left pleural effusion. There could be consolidation in the left upper lung. Lateral view would be very helpful in separating pleura from pulmonary abnormalities. Bronchial blocker traversing a standard placed endotracheal tube ends in the left main bronchus, no less than 3.3 cm from the carina. The right lung is largely clear. There may be a small region of consolidation at the right lung base medially. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Contour of the mediastinal along the aortic arch and left heart border is straightened, probably by central adenopathy.
