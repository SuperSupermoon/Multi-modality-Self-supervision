Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is a right IJ central venous line whose distal tip is at the mid SVC. There are no pneumothoraces. There is again seen a large area of consolidation within the right lung at its mid and lower portion. This is consistent with pneumonia and appears relatively stable since the previous study. The left lung is relatively well aerated. There are no pneumothoraces.
