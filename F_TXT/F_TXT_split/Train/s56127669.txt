As suggested, the lower half of the patient's head overlies the upper portion of the chest of the lung apices and upper mediastinum. Allowing for this, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is probable borderline versus mild cardiomegaly and diffuse increased markings throughout both lungs. Air bronchograms in the retrocardiac region. Compared with ___, involvement in the right lung appears to have progressed to some degree. Targeted review of the report from an ___ chest CT refers to severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality most likely fibrosing nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. The appearance on today's exam is in keeping with that. Given the extent of this abnormality, assessment for superimposed infiltrate or CHF is challenging. There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, with no gross right or left effusion.
