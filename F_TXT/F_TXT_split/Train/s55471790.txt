Interval placement of a right-sided chest tube with its tip projecting over the apex of the right hemithorax. The right apical pneumothorax is smaller compared to earlier this morning, now with a dimension of approximately 1 cm. Stable left lateral pneumothorax with a dimension of 1.5-2 cm. No evidence of tension. Stable diffuse extensive bilateral opacities, consistent with the patient's history of pulmonary fibrosis. Stable cardiomegaly and severe dextro convex scoliosis resulting in markedly distortion of the thoracic cage.
