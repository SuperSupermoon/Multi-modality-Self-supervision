The right sided PICC line terminates in the cavoatrial junction. Median sternotomy wires and two prosthetic cardiac valves are unchanged in position. The lung volumes are extremely low. Bronchovascular markings are accentuated by extremely low lung volumes, but there is likely also a component of mild pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities that are worsening on the right side, are likely due to pleural effusions with adjacent compression atelectasis. However, cannot rule out an underlying pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.
