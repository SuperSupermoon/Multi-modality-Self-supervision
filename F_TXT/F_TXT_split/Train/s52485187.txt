The opacities in the right and left lobe present on the prior chest x-ray are less pronounced on today's study. However, opacification is now seen in the left lower lobe, which was not present on the previous film. Lung volumes remain low. In view of the changing nature of the opacities, appearances most likely represent evidence of failure but pneumonia is not excluded.
