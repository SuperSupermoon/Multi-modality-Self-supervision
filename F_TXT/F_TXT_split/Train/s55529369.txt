There is interval development of a right apical pneumothorax, measuring approximately 1.8 cm on maximum measurement. The right hemithorax remains relatively well aerated, but with diffuse alveolar opacities, similar in extent and degree to the prior examination. There appears to be slight increased volume loss in the left retrocardiac region, which may represent slight worsening atelectasis, although the possibility of a worsening alveolar process cannot be excluded. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Endotracheal tube remains in place, with the tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. Left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is again seen, with the tip at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins. Right-sided implanted catheter is present with the tip at the cavoatrial atrial junction. A feeding tube remains in place, NG type, extending beyond the inferior confines of this film.
