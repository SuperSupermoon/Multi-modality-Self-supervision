The lungs are hypoinflated. There is a small left and probable small right pleural effusion. A focal consolidation in the lower lung bases are difficult to exclude due to overlying soft tissue structures of the chest wall and low lung volumes. The heart size is obscured due to adjacent pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
