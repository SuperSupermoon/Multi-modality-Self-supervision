Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle is consistent with small pleural effusion and atelectatic changes at the left base. No vascular congestion or acute pneumonia. Nasogastric tube extends to the upper stomach, with the side port difficult to see but probably in the region of the cavoatrial junction. The tube should be pushed forward with possible.
