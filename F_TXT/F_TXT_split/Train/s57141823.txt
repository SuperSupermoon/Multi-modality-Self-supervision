There are parenchymal opacities, most pronounced at the lung bases bilaterally, which most likely represents pulmonary edema. However, pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. There are likely small pleural effusions bilaterally. There is upper zone redistribution. No pneumothorax. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Right-sided hemodialysis dual-lumen catheter terminates in the right atrium. Note is made of surgical clips in the left paratracheal region, near the left lung apex.
