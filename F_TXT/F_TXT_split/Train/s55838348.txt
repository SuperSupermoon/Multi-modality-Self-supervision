The endotracheal tube is slightly high-riding, terminating in the thoracic inlet. Advancement by about 2 cm is suggested for more optimal ventilation. A right subclavian central venous catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax. New left perihilar airspace and interstitial opacities may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, aspiration or infection in the appropriate clinical setting. Increased obscuration of the medial left hemidiaphragm may also be due to atelectasis, aspiration or infection.
