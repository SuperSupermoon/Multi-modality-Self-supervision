In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. There again is no evidence of pneumothorax. However, there is now hazy opacification at both bases with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with substantial pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases. No definite vascular congestion is appreciated.
