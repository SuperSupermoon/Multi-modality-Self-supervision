Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged allowing for accentuation by low lung volumes and portable technique. This factor also accentuates the pulmonary vascularity. With this in mind, there is no evidence of congestive heart failure. No focal areas of consolidation are present within the lungs, and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter is noted.
