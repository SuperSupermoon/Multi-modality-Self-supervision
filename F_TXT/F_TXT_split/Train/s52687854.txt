AP portable supine view of the chest. Underlying trauma board is noted. There has been placement of a left pigtail chest tube with its tip projecting over the left mid lung peripherally. There is opacity abutting the tip of the chest tube which could represent a focal area of atelectasis. There is no supine evidence for pneumothorax or large effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. Numerous left rib fractures are better assessed on same-day CT chest.
