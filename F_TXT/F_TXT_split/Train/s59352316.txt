Comparison is made with prior study performed six hours earlier. Small right pneumothorax is stable. Now small left pneumothorax has decreased. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has increased, consistent with increasing atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is probably unchanged. Right lower lobe linear atelectasis is stable. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position.
