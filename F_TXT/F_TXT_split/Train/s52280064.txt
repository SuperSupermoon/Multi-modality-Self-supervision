There is no the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, a right internal jugular temporary pacing wire is unchanged in position and probably terminates in the right ventricle. Mild pulmonary edema is minimally improved. Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are unchanged. Small, left pleural effusion probably unchanged. The lungs are otherwise fully expanded and clear without focal consolidation. No pneumothorax.
