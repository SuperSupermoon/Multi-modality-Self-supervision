Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position, but cuff remains over distended. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Multifocal airspace opacities which remain most severe in the upper lobes appear similar to the prior radiograph except for slight worsening in the left lower lobe. Moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged. No visible pneumothorax.
