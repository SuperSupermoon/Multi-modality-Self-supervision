Since the prior study, there is development of a large right-sided pneumothorax involving one-third of the lung volume. The right-sided central line, left-sided PICC line, tracheostomy, feeding tube, and hardware within the midline as well as stent are all stable in position. There are bilateral pleural effusions and left retrocardiac opacity. Findings of the pneumothorax have been discussed with the CCU team.
