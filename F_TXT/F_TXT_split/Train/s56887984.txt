Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are new obscuring the lower lungs, where there was previously consolidation concerning for pneumonia, particularly on the left. The moderately enlarged heart is now obscured, but I do not believe there is pulmonary edema and I see no pneumothorax. Left subclavian line ends in the mid to low SVC.
