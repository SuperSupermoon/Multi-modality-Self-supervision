Lung volumes are low. Opacity in the left lower hemithorax with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm, lateral border of the descending aorta, and left inferior aspect of the cardiac silhouette may reflect a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion. Pulmonary edema is mild. The heart is moderately enlarged. Aortic knob calcifications are mild. No pneumothorax. Concurrent focal consolidation in the retrocardiac region cannot be completely excluded in the appropriate clinical situation. The patient is slightly rotated with mild dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracic spine. No acute osseous abnormality.
