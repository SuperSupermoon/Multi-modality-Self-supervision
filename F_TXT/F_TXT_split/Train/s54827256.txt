Interval placement of an endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.3 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of view. There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings, however, bilateral perihilar highly areolar opacities raise concern for developing pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in patient position and inspiration.
