1. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which appears to have its tip projected over the stomach, and the side port just below the gastroesophageal junction. A right dual-lumen central venous catheter is unchanged in position. A right basilar pigtail pleural catheter is unchanged in position. There has been interval decrease in size of a right apical lateral pneumothorax. Left lung remains grossly clear, although the left costophrenic angle is not entirely included on this study. The right lung continues to show a patchy opacity at the right base, which may represent post-procedural contusion, residual atelectasis, less likely pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.
