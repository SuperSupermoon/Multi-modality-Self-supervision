As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Known right upper mediastinal mass, presumably a goiter, that causes substantial narrowing of the tracheal diameter and deviation of the trachea to the left. Predescribed calcified costochondral junctions. Unchanged moderate tortuosity and calcification of the aorta. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema or pneumonia. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
