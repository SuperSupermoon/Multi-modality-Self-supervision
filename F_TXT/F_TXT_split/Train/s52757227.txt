Support and monitoring devices are in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by an improving asymmetrically distributed combined alveolar and interstitial pattern affecting the left lung to a greater degree than the right, with relative sparing of the right upper lobe. More confluent opacity in the left retrocardiac region appears unchanged. Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are similar.
