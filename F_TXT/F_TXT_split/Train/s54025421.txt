The lungs are clear without effusion or pneumothorax. Linear bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis. Rounded opacity projects over the anterior left third rib, potentially either within the rib or within the underlying lung parenchyma. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for technique. Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch. No displaced fractures identified.
