A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid SVC. The catheter tubing appears to full on itself in the supraclavicular region, this is likely due to the projection, based on the intraprocedural images but correlation with how well line is functioning is recommended to exclude a kink. Similar in appearance compared to the prior study, prominence of the bilateral hila and the pulmonary vascular structures is again noted. Mild cardiomegaly, unchanged compared to the prior study. No definite pleural effusion seen. No pneumothorax seen.
