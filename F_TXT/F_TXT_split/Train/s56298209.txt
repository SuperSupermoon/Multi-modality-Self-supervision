AP chest compared to ___: Right PICC line has been advanced, tip now at 6.5 cm below the level of the carina, would need to be withdrawn 3 cm to relocate it in the low SVC. Lungs are generally low in volume and mild upper lobe vascular re-distribution is probably a physiologic function of supine positioning. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
