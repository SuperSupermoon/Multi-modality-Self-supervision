The cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged. The aorta is somewhat tortuous. There may be minimal pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. Minimal left mid to lower lung linear atelectasis/scarring is seen. No lobar consolidation is seen. No large pleural effusion is seen although a small pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude on the right. There is a dual lead left-sided pacemaker with leads extending the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.
