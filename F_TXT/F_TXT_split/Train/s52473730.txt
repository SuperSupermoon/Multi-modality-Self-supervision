Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of an endotracheal tube and transesophageal tube. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina. The tip of the transesophageal tube projects over the region of the stomach. Since the prior examination, there has been progressive bibasilar opacities, which may represent atelectasis, though infiltrate is not excluded. A left-sided pleural effusion is likely present. There is no large pneumothorax.
