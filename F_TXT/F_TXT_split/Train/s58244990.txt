As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of massive intra-abdominal air. The endotracheal tube and the right internal jugular vein catheter are in unchanged position. The lung volumes have slightly decreased on the right, leading to widening of the pulmonary vascular structures. On the left, however, a new chest tube has been inserted. As a consequence, the left lung is substantially better ventilated. No pneumothorax is noted. In the retrocardiac lung regions, areas of atelectasis with air bronchograms persist. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
