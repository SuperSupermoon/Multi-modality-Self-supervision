The ET tube has been removed. Right IJ line tip is in the right atrium. The right hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated and there are slightly low lung volumes. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution and perihilar haze. There is dense retrocardiac opacity, consistent with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. Compared to the prior study, the lung volumes are lower and pulmonary edema slightly worse. An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
