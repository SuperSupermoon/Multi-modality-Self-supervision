AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is too low and should be pulled back since it is currently less than 1 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Lung volumes are very low which exaggerate the size of the cardiac silhouette. Bibasilar opacities most likely reflect atelectasis although aspiration in the left lower lobe in particular cannot be entirely excluded. Repeated radiograph is recommended.
