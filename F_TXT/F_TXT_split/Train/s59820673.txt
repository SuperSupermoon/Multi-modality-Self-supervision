Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. AP technique limits evaluation for cardiomegaly, though the heart does appear to be top normal in size. No signs of CHF/pulmonary edema. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No definite signs of pneumonia. A vague nodular opacity projects over the left upper lung which could represents an artifact, though a pulmonary nodule not excluded. Bony structures are intact. Degenerative changes are partially imaged in the T-spine.
