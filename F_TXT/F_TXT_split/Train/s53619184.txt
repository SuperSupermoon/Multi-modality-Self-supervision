A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes with increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. There is bibasilar atelectasis. A retrocardiac opacity is again seen and probably unchanged compared to the prior radiograph, again possibly representing atelectasis, but superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
