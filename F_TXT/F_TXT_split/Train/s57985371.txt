Heart size remains mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vascularity is normal without evidence of pulmonary edema. Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis and/or scarring. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. No subdiaphragmatic free air is demonstrated.
