AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained. Lung volumes are somewhat low though the lungs appear clear without signs of pneumonia or CHF. The heart is partially assessed only due to low lung volumes though appears grossly unremarkable. A tiny stent projecting over the left heart border may represent a coronary stent. Mediastinal contour is normal. Bony structures intact.
