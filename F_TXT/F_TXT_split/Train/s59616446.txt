In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of right IJ catheter that extends to the upper to mid portion of the SVC. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 7.3 cm above the carina and a nasogastric tube extends to the lower body of the stomach. Again there is evidence of pulmonary edema without pleural effusions. In view of the normal size of the heart, noncardiogenic edema should be considered. The pattern could also represent diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
