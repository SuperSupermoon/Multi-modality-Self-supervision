Massive enlargement of the cardiac silhouette size has increased in size compared to the previous exam and is concerning for increasing pericardial effusion. A large hiatal hernia is again seen. The lung volumes are low with crowding of the bronchovascular structures and probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt pulmonary edema. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, but infection cannot be completely excluded. There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified. There are degenerative changes noted in both glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints with narrowed acromiohumeral intervals suggestive of underlying rotator cuff disease. Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle remains in unchanged position.
