Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The study is suboptimal and underpenetrated due to overlying soft tissue. Given this, no definite focal consolidation is seen. Relative increased opacity diffusely over the right lung as compared to the left may be due to overlying soft tissue. There may be mild vascular congestion, increased since prior. No large pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
