There has been interval removal of right-sided pigtail catheter. Tiny right apical pneumothorax likely still persists. Bilateral areas of atelectasis are again noted to be increased bilaterally and there maty be increasing vascular congestion. Otherwise, little change in comparison to prior study from yesterday.
