Interval placement of permanent pacemaker with leads overlying expected locations of right atrium and right ventricle. Standard PA and lateral chest radiograph would be helpful to confirm appropriate placement of the right ventricular lead when the patient's condition permits. There is no visible pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is accompanied by new pulmonary vascular congestion and perihilar edema as well as increasing bilateral pleural effusions, now moderate in size. Adjacent bibasilar atelectasis is also demonstrated.
