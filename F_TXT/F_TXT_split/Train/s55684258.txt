An endotracheal tube is slightly low lying with the tip terminating 2.3 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip terminating in the left upper quadrant, likely within the gastric fundus. A right internal jugular central venous catheter is in place with the tip projecting over the low SVC. The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this single supine view. The pulmonary vasculature appears prominent. Opacities projecting over the left heart border may represent atelectasis, although infection or aspiration are also possible. Bronchovascular crowding due to low lung volumes is noted, though there is likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is accentuated by low lung volumes. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
