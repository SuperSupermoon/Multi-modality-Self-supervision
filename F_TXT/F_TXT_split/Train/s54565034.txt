As compared to the previous radiograph, a previously seen small air-fluid level projecting over the right hemi thorax is no longer visible. However, a minimal left and a moderate right pleural effusion are still present. A mediastinal drain in the midline is new on today's image. The appearance of the cardiac silhouette is constant. The patient currently shows mild pulmonary edema.
