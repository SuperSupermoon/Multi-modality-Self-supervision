A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a left subclavian catheter with the tip at the origin of the SVC, an endotracheal tube in standard position, and a nasogastric tube which extends at least into the stomach. Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged in the right lower lobe, but improved in the left lower lobe. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
