Widespread pulmonary nodules and masses are again demonstrated and have slightly progressed since the previous radiograph. Superimposed areas of consolidation and/or atelectasis at the lung bases on the previous study have resolved, and previously present pleural effusions are no longer evident. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.
