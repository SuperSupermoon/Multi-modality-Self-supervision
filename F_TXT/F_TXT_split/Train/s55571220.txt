AP chest compared to ___: ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Right PIC line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. Small left pleural effusion and left basal consolidation probably atelectasis are unchanged. There is a slight increase in pulmonary vascular congestion and mild right basal atelectasis, but no definite edema. The heterogeneous cavitary consolidation in the left upper lobe is less extensive in overall volume than it was on ___, and large focal opacities contained within are less pronounced. This suggests healing and fibrosis are probably underway.
