The tip and sideport of the nasogastric tube terminate within the stomach. An endotracheal tube is in unchanged position approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. A left central venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC. Atelectasis of the left lung is slightly worse, causing volume loss and subsequent leftward shift of mediastinal structures. The low lung volumes are causing crowding pulmonary vasculature. The small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged. No pulmonary edema is identified. There is no pneumothorax.
