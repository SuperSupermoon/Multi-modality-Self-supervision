Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. Heart size and mediastinum are normal in size. Lung volumes are preserved. No definitive focal consolidations are demonstrated, but multiple rib fractures may obscure on the right presence of parenchymal abnormalities. Left lung is essentially clear and there is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
