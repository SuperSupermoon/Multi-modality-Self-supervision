AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, ___: Peribronchial opacification in the right lower lung could represent recent aspiration. I would suggest a repeat chest radiograph in eight hours if the patient has clinical signs of pneumonia. Heart size is top normal. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new but there is no edema or pleural effusion. Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified but not dilated.
