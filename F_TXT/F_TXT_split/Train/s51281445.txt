Single portable supine chest radiograph was provided. Lung volumes are low. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and the hila compatible with pulmonary congestion. There are bibasilar consolidations, likely a combination of atelectasis and pneumonia. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is notable for a tortuous aorta. There is no pneumothorax. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
