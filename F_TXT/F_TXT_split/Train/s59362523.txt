AP chest compared to ___: The only region of questionable pulmonary abnormality is at the left lung base. I strongly recommend conventional radiographs if feasible to evaluate possible pneumonia. Lungs are otherwise clear. Pleural effusion, minimal if any. Slight interval increase in heart size, still normal.
