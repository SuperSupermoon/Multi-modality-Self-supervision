Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates interval left pleural catheter placement, which projects over lateral left chest. Moderate left pleural effusion has decreased in size, now small. Left lung base opacities persist, which may represent atelectasis. Trace right pleural effusion is likely. There is no appreciable pneumothorax. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Ascending aorta remains tortuous. There is also enlargement of pulmonary arteries, most pronounced on the left. The heart is mildly enlarged. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pulmonary edema.
