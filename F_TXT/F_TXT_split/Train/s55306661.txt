Comparison is made to prior study from ___. A right-sided PICC line, bilateral chest tubes, endotracheal tube and feeding tube which are all unchanged in position. The feeding tube tip is pointing cranially and there is a single loop and the distal tip in the fundus of the stomach. There is persistent consolidation and increased density at the right mid lung field consistent with loculated fluid. Underlying consolidation is not excluded. Small basilar bilateral pleural effusions are identified. No pneumothoraces are seen.
