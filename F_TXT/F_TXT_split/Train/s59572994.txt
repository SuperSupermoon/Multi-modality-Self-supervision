Portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. Compared to the most recent prior radiograph, there are new diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. In addition, there has been significant enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, prominence of the pulmonary artery, and distention of the azygous vein, consistent with right heart failure. These findings are concerning for cor pulmonale in the setting of acute sickle cell crisis. Bilateral infiltrates are likely due to pulmonary edema; however, infarction and infection cannot be excluded. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Also demonstrated are multiple loops of distended large bowel, although the abdomen is incompletely evaluated on this film.
