Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes resulting in bronchovascular crowding. Again seen are small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. However, superimposed infection could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. There is evidence of mild pulmonary vascular congestion. A pacemaker is in place with the leads in the expected position in the right atrium and right ventricle. The cardiomediastinal contour is slightly improved. There is no pneumothorax. A pericardial drain projects over the cardiac silhouette.
