Rotated positioning. Compared with ___, there has been some interval clearing at both bases, with decreased retrocardiac opacity and renewed visualization of the left hemidiaphragm. Air bronchograms at the right base have also resolved. Small residual left-greater-than-right patchy opacity remains visible. Previously seen vascular blurring, consistent with mild CHF, has resolved. Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette, with sternotomy wires and prosthetic valve again noted, unchanged.
