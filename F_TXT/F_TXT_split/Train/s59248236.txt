AP chest compared to ___: As far as one can judge from a single frontal view alone, there has been little change in the lungs following bronchoscopy, for evaluation of the large right lower lobe mass. The right hilus is greatly enlarged, also unchanged. There is probably a new small to moderate right pleural effusion which would be better assessed with a lateral view. I see no pneumothorax. Left lung is clear and the heart size is normal.
