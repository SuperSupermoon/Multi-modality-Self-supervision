1. The right internal jugular line now has its tip in the mid SVC. A right basilar chest tube and mediastinal drains remain in place. There has been some interval improvement in aeration at the left lung base where there is still residual patchy opacity and a layering effusion favoring compressive atelectasis. Patchy opacity at the right base likely reflects atelectasis and is unchanged. No pneumothorax is seen. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Relatively low lung volumes with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy. Sutural material in the left humeral head is consistent with prior rotator cuff tear. A 1 cm calcified opacity is seen in the right acromiohumeral space, possibly representing a loose body.
