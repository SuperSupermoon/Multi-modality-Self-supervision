There is some limitation due to poor inspiratory effort. There are chronic cardiac monitoring leads and transfer device overlying the lower lung fields. There is cardiomegaly, upper zone redistribution and blurring of vascular detail all consistent with CHF. This is slightly more pronounced than on the earlier study. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured and consolidation is likely in the left base. There is a small area of patchy density in the right upper lobe. There is no pneumothorax.
