Bilateral chest tubes have been removed. Sternal wires and prosthetic valve are again seen. The ET tube has been removed. NG tube has been removed. There is bilateral lower lobe volume loss and small bilateral effusions. No pneumothorax is visualized. There is mild pulmonary vascular redistribution. Some hazy alveolar infiltrate in bilateral lower lobes, likely due to volume loss but an early infiltrate cannot be excluded. Fluid overload is less pronounced than on the prior study.
