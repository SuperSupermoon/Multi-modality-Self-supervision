As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes are constant. The lung parenchyma is increased in transparency, likely reflecting improved ventilation and a bigger inspiratory effort. Remnant atelectasis are seen in the retrocardiac lung areas and in the left perihilar regions. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Minimal tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
