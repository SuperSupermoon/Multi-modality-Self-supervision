Small right pleural effusion has nearly resolved. There is no pneumothorax. Right basal atelectasis has improved. Left lung clear. Heart size normal. Right atrial ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in position, but localization would require conventional frontal and lateral views. No pneumothorax. As before there is the suggestion of distention of the upper esophagus and at the thoracic inlet.
