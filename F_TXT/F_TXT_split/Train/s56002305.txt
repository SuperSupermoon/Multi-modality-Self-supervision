Again seen is a a right-sided indwelling catheter and left sided dual lead pacemaker, grossly unchanged. Also again seen is a small left apical pneumothorax, unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, consistent with interstitial thickening. The small to moderate right pleural effusion with underlying right base collapse and/or consolidation is unchanged. Patchy opacity at the left base is similar, though perhaps slightly more pronounced on the current film. There is increased obscuration left hemidiaphragm and blunting of left costophrenic angle.
