As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. There is a focal area of parenchymal opacity at the right lung base, likely reflecting atelectasis, but coexisting pneumonia cannot be excluded. An area of consolidated lung in the retrocardiac lung region is not substantially changed. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No larger pleural effusion. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
