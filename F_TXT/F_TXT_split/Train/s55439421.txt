The ET tube is low, 1.8 cm above the carina and is pointed towards the right main stem bronchus. Cardiomegaly, left lower lobe volume loss are similar. There is increased alveolar infiltrate bilaterally with more dense opacity in the region just above the major fissure with increased volume loss/focal infiltrate. The position of the ET tube was communicated by preliminary report by Dr. ___ at 5:56 AM.
