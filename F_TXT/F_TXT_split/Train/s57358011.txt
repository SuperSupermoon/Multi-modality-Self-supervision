AP chest compared to ___ at 5:54 p.m.: Moderate-to-large right pneumothorax is new despite apical pleural tube. There is no appreciable right pleural effusion and no mediastinal shift or displacement of the right hemidiaphragm, but the volume of pleural air is probably underestimated. Left lung is clear. There is no vascular congestion or edema and the heart size and mediastinal configuration are normal. There is new subcutaneous emphysema at the thoracic inlet which could be in the mediastinum or in the pleural or extrapleural space. Dr. ___ was paged at 8:25 a.m., one minute after the recognition of findings, which we discussed by telephone 2 minutes later.
