As compared to the previous radiograph from less than 2 hr earlier, the endotracheal tube has been withdrawn a few cm, now terminating 7.7 cm above the carina. This could be advanced a few cm for standard positioning. Exam is otherwise remarkable for slight improvement in bibasilar atelectasis and persistent bilateral pleural effusions. No visible pneumothorax.
