As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of pulmonary edema have mildly decreased. However, there still is substantial right and a small left pleural effusion, both with subsequent areas of atelectasis at the lung bases. The sternal wires and the monitoring and support devices are constant. No new parenchymal opacities.
