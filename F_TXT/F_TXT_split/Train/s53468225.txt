The heart remains moderately enlarged. Aortic knob is calcified, and there is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted, with streaky right basilar opacity, possibly reflecting asymmetric pulmonary edema or atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities present.
