The fluid collection in the left upper hemithorax, where there has been posterior rib resection, moderate dependent left pleural effusion, and poor aeration of the left lung have been relatively unchanged for week. Right lung consolidation, just above the minor fissure, is also relatively stable, but overall right lung volume has improved and there is no longer any pulmonary edema. Another focus of pneumonia may be developing at the right lung base and should be monitored closely. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. There is no pneumothorax. Fractures of the lateral left middle ribs have been noted.
