There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube with some left-sided chest well subcutaneous emphysema noted. Low lung volumes persist. Moderate to large left pleural effusion is slightly decreased as compared to the prior study. Left upper to mid lung opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis although underlying consolidation is not excluded. The right lung is grossly clear. No large pneumothorax is seen although it would be difficult to exclude a tiny left apical pneumothorax.
