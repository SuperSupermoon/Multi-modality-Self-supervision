Lung volumes are low. The heart size is accentuated due to the presence of low inspiratory lung volumes, appearing borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. No pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Assessment of the lung bases is limited by low lung volumes. Patchy opacities in both lower lobes may reflect atelectasis. No right pleural effusion is demonstrated, and no large left pleural effusion is seen, though a small left pleural effusion is not completely excluded. No pneumothorax is detected.
