An ET tube is present. The tip is not well delineated but is probably similar in position, approximately 3.9 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm, off film. A left subclavian central line is present, tip over SVC/RA junction or possibly upper right atrium. Bibasilar opacities and smallright-greater-than-left bilateral effusions with vascular plethora are similar to the prior study. As before, while this may reflect pulmonary edema, the differential could include a pneumonic infiltrate.
