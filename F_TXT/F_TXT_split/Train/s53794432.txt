AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes remain low with bibasal atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusion. There is a questionable new opacity in the left upper lung, that might reflect interval development or progression of pre-existing consolidation. No pneumothorax or interval increase in pleural effusion noted.
