A right chest tube remains in place and there is a stable small right apical pneumothorax which extends medially. The overlying subcutaneous emphysema within the chest wall and neck soft tissues and pneumomediastinum is likely not significantly changed. There is a layering right effusion. Lung volumes are low with crowding of the vasculature. There is increasing opacity at the left base with a stable patchy opacity at the right base. Although these findings may reflect atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is advised.
