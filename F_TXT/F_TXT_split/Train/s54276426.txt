In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis. The opacification at the right base medially is again seen, seen on previous CT to reflect prior radiation changes. The enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is apparently secondary to a known pericardial effusion.
