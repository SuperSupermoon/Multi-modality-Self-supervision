Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic arch. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is mild pulmonary edema. Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous study with patchy opacities in the lung bases most reflective of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. A trace left pleural effusion appears to be unchanged. Several clips are noted projecting over the left axillary region. There are multilevel mild to moderate degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine along with S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis.
