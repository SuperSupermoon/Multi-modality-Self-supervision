There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube with near resolution of the moderate right-sided pneumothorax and re-expansion of the right lung, with only a small residual pneumothorax at the apex. Opacity is seen in the right lung, likely reflecting known postradiation changes. The left lung is well expanded and clear. There is no pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
