No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged. There is prominence of the transverse arch of the aorta with mild tortuosity of the lower thoracic aorta. CT would be necessary to assess the underlying type B dissection. There is engorgement of ill defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle could reflect small pleural effusion.
