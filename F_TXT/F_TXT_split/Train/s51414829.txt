Left subclavian PICC is unchanged with tip ending in the lower SVC. Stable interstitial reticular changes are compatible with known interstitial fibrosis, more severe at the lung bases, also with evidence of cystic spaces at the right base. There are no new consolidations or atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema is stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
