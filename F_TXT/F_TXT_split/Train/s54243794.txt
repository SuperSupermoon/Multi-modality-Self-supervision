While the orogastric tube extends to the body of the stomach, with the side hole at about the level of the esophagogastric junction. This should be pushed forward EF possible. Postsurgical changes in the right hemithorax again seen. Increased opacity at the left base process, with possible other focus in the upper to midportion of the lung. This appearance is worrisome for superimposed aspiration or infectious pneumonia.
