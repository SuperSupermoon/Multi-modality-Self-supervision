Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. There is airspace consolidation involving the bilateral lower lungs which could represent pneumonia with possible associated pleural effusion. A lateral view would aid in diagnosis. Heart size cannot be fully assessed due to silhouetting by adjacent consolidation. There is faint atherosclerotic calcification along the aortic knob. No pneumothorax. Upper lungs are well aerated. The bony structures appear intact.
