As compared to the previous radiograph, there is now convincing evidence of the presence of a 1 cm left apical pneumothorax. The small pleural inclusion at the left lung bases, approximately at the site of the chest tube insertion, is constant. There is no evidence of tension. The bilateral pleural effusions and subsequent areas of atelectasis are unchanged in appearance.
