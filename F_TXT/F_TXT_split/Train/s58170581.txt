The AP radiograph demonstrated the patient continues to be intubated with the ET tube being just above the carina, 1.6 cm and should be pulled back for approximately 2 cm. Bilateral chest tubes are in place, there is no substantial change since the prior study. There is minimal interval improvement in the right upper and mid lung consolidation. No definitive right pneumothorax is seen. Minimal left apical pneumothorax is suspected.
