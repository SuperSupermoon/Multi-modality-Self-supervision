As compared to a previous radiograph, all monitoring and support devices are in constant position. The lung volumes have increased, likely resulting from increased intrathoracic pressure. The distribution of the pleural effusions, the size of the cardiac silhouette and the areas of retrocardiac and right basal atelectasis are constant. Also constant is the apical component of the pleural effusions. No evidence of new parenchymal changes. No pneumothorax.
