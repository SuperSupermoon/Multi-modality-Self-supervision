The patient's face mask and mandible obscures the apices. No large pneumothorax is appreciated. Lung volumes are diminished and there are bilateral streaky opacities which may reflect areas of atelectasis. The central pulmonary vessels remain prominent which may reflect underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning.
