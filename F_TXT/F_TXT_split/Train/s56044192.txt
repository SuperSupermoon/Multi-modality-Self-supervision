Interval placement of a right pleural pigtail catheter which appears to be kinked. No pneumothorax; however, the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-erect technique. Right mid to lower lung nodular opacity and lateral pleural thickening likely correspond to a combination of loculated pleural fluid and atelectasis and/ pneumonia when correlated with the chest CT dated ___. No pulmonary edema. Low lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. Linear opacity in the left mid lung either reflects subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
