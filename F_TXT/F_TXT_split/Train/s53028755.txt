Cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged, and accompanied by enlarged central pulmonary vasculature suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension. Peribronchial cuffing and scattered septal lines suggest the presence of interstitial edema. Additional patchy opacities are present in the left mid and right lower lung regions, and may reflect patchy atelectasis, aspiration, or early focus of pneumonia. Followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
