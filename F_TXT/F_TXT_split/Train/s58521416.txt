In comparison with the study of ___, there is now a Dobbhoff tube in place with the opaque tip in the antral region. Right subclavian catheter again extends to the lower portion of the SVC. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist, most likely related to pulmonary edema. The focal opacification at the right base is not as apparent on the previous study.
