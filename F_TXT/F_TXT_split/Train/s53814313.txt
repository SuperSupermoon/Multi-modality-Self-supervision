Stable, moderate cardiomegaly. Severe right convex scoliosis. A face mask projects over the heart and left mediastinum. Stable, aortic arch calcification. Stable, mild vascular congestion. Persistent consolidation at the left base with no improvement over the past 5 days may reflect persistent left lower lobe pneumonia or atelectasis. Smaller opacity at the right base is also stable over multiple examinations and may reflect persistent atelectasis or pneumonia. No pneumothorax. Stable, small left pleural effusion. Right shoulder hardware is intact.
