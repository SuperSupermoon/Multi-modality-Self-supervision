Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There is moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly. Transvenous pacemaker leads are in standard position, in the right atrium and right ventricle. There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions. Small bilateral pleural effusions are better seen in prior CT. Increased opacity in the right upper lung is worrisome for aspiration, as it does opacities in the left lower lobe. Patient has known emphysema.
