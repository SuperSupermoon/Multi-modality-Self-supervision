Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular introducer is in place with the tip in the proximal SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Lungs are slightly low in volume but no focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. No pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi supine technique. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits given portable technique.
