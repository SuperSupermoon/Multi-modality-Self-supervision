Compared with the immediate prior study of earlier the same day, there is a new right-sided pigtail drainage catheter. There is no pneumothorax. The right pleural effusion has significantly decreased, with only a trace pleural effusion remaining, though there may be a residual subpulmonic effusion. Fluid no longer extends into the minor fissure. There is no left-sided pleural effusion. There is no focal consolidation or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
