Portable AP upright view of the chest provided. There is a vagal nerve stimulator device projecting over the left lower chest with catheter extending into the neck. Lung volumes are low without convincing evidence for pneumonia or CHF. Please note, a portion of the left lung base is obscured due to the vagal stimulator. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. No definite signs of effusion or pneumothorax. The bony structures are intact.
