The increase in the generalized background opacification of the lungs since ___ is probably a manifestation of pulmonary edema. Without baseline chest radiographs I cannot tell how much pulmonary fibrosis there is, nor whether the more severe opacification in the left lower lobe is due to recent aspiration or pneumonia, either is a distinct possibility. Low lung volumes exaggerate borderline cardiomegaly. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. There is no pneumothorax. An OG tube passes into the nondistended stomach and out of view. Tip of the endotracheal tube is no more than 15 mm above the carina and should be withdrawn 2.5 cm to avoid inadvertent unilateral intubation.
