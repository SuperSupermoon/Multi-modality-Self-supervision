A right upper extremity PICC terminates in the distal superior vena cava. Lung volumes are minimally improved. There is an unchanged infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, right greater than left, consistent with the history of ARDS. A more focal area of airspace consolidation seen in the right upper lobe is new. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion.
