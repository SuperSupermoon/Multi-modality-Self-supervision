AP view of the chest provided. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Persistent atelectasis of the right lung base is again seen. Left lung base opacity is more clear. Of note, lucent line in the superolateral aspect of the right lung is most likely a skin fold and should not be mistaken for a pneumothorax. Right-sided pigtail catheter is in satisfactory position.
