The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged from the most recent prior examination with stable cardiomegaly. Opacification at the left lung base appears consistent with a focal consolidation. Minimal opacification at the right lung base is noted. The ET tube is at least 2.6 cm from the carina. A right large central catheter ends in the right atrium. Feeding tube is noted with side port in the expected region of the stomach.
