As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The right internal jugular vein catheter is in unchanged position. The lung volumes have slightly decreased. Areas of parenchymal opacities are still seen at the bases of the right upper lobe, at the left lung bases and in the retrocardiac lung regions. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions.
