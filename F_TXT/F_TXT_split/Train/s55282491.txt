As compared to the previous image, a pre-existing right upper lobe opacity, likely infectious in origin, has increased in extent and severity. Newly appeared is a left basal parenchymal opacity of similar morphology. The heart continues to be enlarged. The alignment of the sternal wires is constant. The diameter and overall aspect of the pulmonary vasculature continues to be suggestive of mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema is present. No pleural effusions.
