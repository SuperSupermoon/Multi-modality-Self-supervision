As compared to the previous radiograph, the pleural effusion on the right has decreased. A right basal parenchymal opacity is now visually more apparent than on the previous image. The abnormality might represent an infectious process such as pneumonia or aspiration, but could also reflect reexpansion edema caused by the resolution of the pre-existing pleural effusion. The retrocardiac atelectasis has minimally decreased in severity. The pre-existing pulmonary opacities, notably at the left lung base and the left perihilar areas, have minimally increased in extent. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
