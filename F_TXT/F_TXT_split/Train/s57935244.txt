As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach. There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. There is increasing atelectasis at the right lung bases and minimally increasing effusion on the left. The appearance of the cardiac silhouette is constant.
