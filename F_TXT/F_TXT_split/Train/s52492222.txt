AP chest compared to ___: Endotracheal tube is no less than 5 cm from the carina, terminating at the thoracic inlet. Previous asymmetric pulmonary edema and left upper lobe atelectasis have improved, but moderate cardiomegaly and severe vascular widening of the mediastinum have not. Right jugular line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction and a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Pleural effusions are small, if any. No pneumothorax. Consolidation in the infrahilar left lower lobe is probably atelectasis since it was more pronounced on ___, and there was more ipsilateral mediastinal shift, since resolved.
