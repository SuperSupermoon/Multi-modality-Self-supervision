CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Markedly rotated positioning, which distorts the usual contours. An ET tube is present. This likely lies approximately 4.8 cm above the carina. An NG-type tube is present, tip likely beneath the diaphragm. There is increased density at the left lung base, difficult to evaluate due to rotation. There is probable CHF. Possibility of effusions and right base atelectasis cannot be excluded. Spinal fixation hardware noted. C ompared with ___, there is some increased aeration in the left upper zone. Possible slight worsening of opacity at the right base.
