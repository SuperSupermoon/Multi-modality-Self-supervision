Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval improvement in the previously seen pulmonary edema of the right lung. The left lung, however, remains largely unchanged from the prior study. There is opacification of the left lung base, likely representing left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion. There has been little, if any, interval change since the prior study. The right PICC line is in standard position, terminating in the mid SVC. Median sternotomy wires are unchanged in position since the prior study. There is severe bilateral shoulder degenerative disease, as seen previously.
