Large left mid-to-lower lung/perihilar opacity is worrisome for pneumonia. This appears even more prominent as compared to the prior study earlier the same date. An underlying component of aspiration or hemorrhage is not excluded. Slight reticulation at the right lung base could be due to chronic changes. No pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The mediastinum is unremarkable. Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
