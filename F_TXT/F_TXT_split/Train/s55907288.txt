AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 11 hours earlier during the same day. AP single view of the chest demonstrates poor inspirational effort with relatively high-positioned diaphragms. No evidence of new abnormalities. No pneumothorax in the apical area and no evidence of subdiaphragmatic air in this patient. There is no evidence of any remaining radiopaque foreign body on this chest examination.
