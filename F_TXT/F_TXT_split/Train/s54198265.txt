Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, which have slightly increased in size compared to the study obtained two days ago. Mild pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement persist. There is bibasilar atelectasis, with secondary signs of improvement within the left lower lobe. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax. A tracheostomy tube sits in the mid trachea, and is slightly rotated, directed toward the left wall of the trachea. A left internal jugular central venous line terminates in the low SVC. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and inferiorly out of the field of view.
