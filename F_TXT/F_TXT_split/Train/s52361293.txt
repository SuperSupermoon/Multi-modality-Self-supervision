In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been removal of the right chest tube with no definite pneumothorax. There are lower lung volumes with continued opacifications centrally involving much of the right lung. This would be consistent with the previous suggestion of hematoma and anterior pneumatocele. Lateral view if clinically possible could be helpful.
