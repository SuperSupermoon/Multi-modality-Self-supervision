There is a moderate left-sided pleural effusion with associated opacity, probably due to atelectasis. Similar but less striking findings are present on the right with a small effusion. There is new prominence of the pulmonary vascularity, which appears mildly distended and indistinct suggesting mild vascular congestion. The heart is again mildly enlarged. The aortic arch is calcified.
