The endotracheal tube tip seats 4 cm above the carina. The endogastric tube courses inferiorly out of the field of view. The right-sided subclavian line tip terminates in the low SVC. The right-sided pleural pigtail catheter projects over the left lower chest. The heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The lung volumes are low with retrocardiac atelectasis. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests small pleural effusion there. An ovoid density projecting over the right mid lung field likely reflects pleural fluid trapped within the major fissure, with mildly increasing right pleural effusion. Overall, the lungs demonstrate gradually improving edema.
