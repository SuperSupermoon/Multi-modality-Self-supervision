Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates hyperinflation and flattening of the diaphragms, suggestive of emphysema. Lungs are otherwise clear and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Aside from aortic tortuosity, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Subtle radiodensity above the level of manubrium may represent junctional line as seen on CTA-Chest. Prior vertebroplasty is noted in the lower thoracic vertebra.
