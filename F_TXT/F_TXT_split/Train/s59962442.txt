Single portable supine chest radiograph was obtained. Endotracheal tube is in the lower trachea, approximately 1.7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm and terminates within the stomach. The lung volumes are low. There are bibasilar opacities that may represent atelectasis. There is mild prominence of the interstitial markings, which may represent mild pulmonary congestion. Cardiac silhouette appears slightly enlarged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
