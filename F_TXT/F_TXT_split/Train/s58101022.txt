Left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place in the periphery of the left mid hemithorax. There has been improvement in the extent of subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall. A small apicolateral pneumothorax is present on the left. Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position except for removal of a left PICC. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. With the exception of improving aeration in the left lower lobe, overall appearance of lungs and pleura is similar to the recent radiograph of one day earlier.
