Right internal jugular line terminates most likely at the junction of the left jugular vein and brachycephalic vein. Cardiomegaly is unchanged, moderate. There is substantial improvement in the left perihilar opacities that might reflect resolution of asymmetric edema or aspiration. Right basal opacity has improved as well. Right central venous line tip terminates in the right atrium. There is no pneumothorax. There is no interval increase in pleural effusion.
