Lung volumes remain low. Diffuse widening of cardiomediastinal contours is unchanged, and is likely related to accentuation of mediastinal lipomatosis by low lung volumes and patient rotation. Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular structures, limiting assessment of cardiovascular status of the patient. Recently described right upper lobe airspace opacities have slightly improved. Such rapid improvement favors acute aspiration or asymmetrical edema over infectious pneumonia, but continued followup may be helpful to document resolution, particularly considering clinical suspicion for infection. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Tracheostomy tube and feeding tube remain in place, in standard position.
