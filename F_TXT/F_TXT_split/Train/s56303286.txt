Chronic changes are seen in the mid thoracic spine with associated dextroscoliosis and changes in the adjacent ribs. The right lung is clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Opacity in the retrocardiac region at the left lung base appears similar compared to multiple priors and is likely in part due to volume loss and elevation of the hemidiaphragm. The superior left lung is clear. Chronic changes are noted at the left shoulder.
