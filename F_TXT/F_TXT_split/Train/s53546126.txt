Rotated positioning. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. Probable small left effusion. Of note, there is a rounded opacity projecting immediately to the left of the expected location of the left hilum. This could relate to a parenchymal opacity, but the configuration is concerning for pulmonary artery enlargement, pulmonary artery aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm, or mass related to the left hilum. This is in keeping with findings on the ___ 18:36 p.m. chest CT, albeit a limited CT study due to the absence of IV contrast. There is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, suggesting mild CHF. Possible trace right-sided pleural fluid. No focal infiltrate identified on the right. Upper abdominal surgical ___ noted. No pneumothorax detected. Incidental note made of surgical anchors overlying the right humerus.
