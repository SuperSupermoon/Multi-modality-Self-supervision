At the left lower corner of film there is a sharp demarcation of the soft tissues which is artifactual. The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart is top-normal in size, likely accentuated due to patient positioning and low lung volumes. Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable. An endotracheal tube is at the level of thoracic inlet 8 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric feeding tube is seen coursing midline with tip out of field of view.
