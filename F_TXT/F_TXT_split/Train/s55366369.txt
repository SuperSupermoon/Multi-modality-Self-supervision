Previous mild pulmonary edema has resolved and lung volumes have improved. Moderate cardiomegaly is probably unchanged. A host of transvenous pacer and pacer defibrillator leads, continuous from the left pectoral pacemaker, and abandoned from a previous right-sided generator are unchanged in their respective positions. Lungs are grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax pleural effusion or mediastinal widening.
