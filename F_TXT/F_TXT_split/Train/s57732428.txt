In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size. Hazy opacification at the bases with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with layering pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis at the bases. There is increased indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The intra-aortic balloon pump has been removed.
