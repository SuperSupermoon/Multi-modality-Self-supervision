The left subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Stable biapical pleural changes and more focal areas of opacity in the right upper lobe are suggestive of prior granulomatous infection. No new focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest acute pneumonia. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
