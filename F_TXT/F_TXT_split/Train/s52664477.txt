1. Status post median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement and stable cardiac enlargement. Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess but likely stable given patient's rotation on the current study. There continue to be layering bilateral effusions and persistent bibasilar consolidation, left greater than right, which most likely represents compressive atelectasis or asymmetric pulmonary edema in the setting of underlying emphysema, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Overall, the edema has somewhat improved since the previous study. The lungs appear hyperinflated suggesting underlying emphysema. Linear opacity at left base consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. Soft tissue in the left superior mediastinum deviating the trachea slightly to the right may reflect substernal goiter. Clinical correlation is advised. Calcifications in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. No evidence of pneumothorax.
