Interval increase in pulmonary vascular engorgement is consistent with moderate to severe pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacity in this setting is most likely atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely also increased without pneumothorax. The heart is stably enlarged with otherwise normal mediastinal contours.
