Lung along volumes remain low. Heart size is mildly enlarged but not substantially changed. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Minimal patchy left basilar opacity likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
