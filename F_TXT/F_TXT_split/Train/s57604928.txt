Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates enteric feeding tube coursing mid line with tip in stomach and side ports above the gastroesophageal junction. Right IJ tip is in mid SVC. Intact median sternotomy wires, mediastinal clips, and chain suture material projecting over the right mid lung. The lungs are moderately well inflated. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with retrocardiac opacity is most consistent with atelectasis. Right lung is clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Stable mild cardiomegaly. Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen demonstrates 3 stacked mildly dilated loops of bowel within the left upper quadrant.
