1. Lines and tubes as described. 2. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema, which limits detail in the lungs. 3. No obvious left-sided pneumothorax, though a tiny left pneumothorax would be difficult to exclude. 4. Prominent left hilum, possibly more so than on ___. Left mid zone opacity, however, is present, but smaller. 5. Hazy opacity of right upper lung of uncertain significance, more pronounced than on the prior study, but overall similar to a film dated ___ at 00:05 a.m. Differential diagnosis includes layering pleural fluid, atelectasis, or possible parenchymal consolidation. 6. Minimal atelectasis at the left lung base probably slightly improved. Doubt CHF. No gross effusion.
