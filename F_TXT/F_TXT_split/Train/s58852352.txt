In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends into the body of the stomach. The side hole is probably just beyond the level of the esophagogastric junction. Again, there is huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with minimal engorgement of pulmonary vessels. Left basilar opacification now obscures the hemidiaphragm and is consistent with some combination with volume loss in the lower lobe and atelectatic change.
