In comparison with the previous study of ___, the Dobbhoff tube appears to have been pushed forward so that the opaque portion is entirely below the esophagogastric junction. There are continued low lung volumes, which may account for the mild prominence of the cardiac silhouette. Engorgement of pulmonary vessels persists, consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. No definite pleural effusion. There is a small area at the right base with more coalescence of opacification. This could possibly represent an area of developing consolidation.
