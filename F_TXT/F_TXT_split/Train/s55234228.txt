Heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob. Hilar contours are unchanged and remain prominent. Lungs appear hyperinflated with probable mild emphysematous changes in the upper lobes. Patchy opacity within the right lung base is nonspecific and may reflect an area of atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded. Minimal streaky left basilar opacity is also noted. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Calcified pleural and parenchymal scarring is seen within the lung apices. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
