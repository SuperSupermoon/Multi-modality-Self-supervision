AP chest compared to ___: Volume of the small right apical pneumothorax has decreased slightly since ___ rising from the level of the third to the second posterior interspace. Obliquely oriented pleural tube crossing the right mid hemithorax and a basal tube are unchanged in their respective positions. Some layering pleural fluid is presumed, but not an appreciable volume. Aeration at the right base is improving. Large intestinal hiatus hernia is present. Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis is stable. No left pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is exaggerated by the hiatus hernia, probably not really enlarged. Pulmonary vasculature unremarkable.
