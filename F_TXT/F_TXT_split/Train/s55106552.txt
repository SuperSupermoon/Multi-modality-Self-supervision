AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. The patient is status post recent thoracotomy on left side for bullectomy. Two left-sided chest tubes are identified, one of them terminate in the apical area, the second in the lower half of the hemithorax in the mediastinal direction. There is now a local mostly linear density in the left upper lobe area compatible with the described bullectomy and indicating postoperative atelectasis and possible some hematoma. No evidence of significant pneumothorax. No other new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are seen, and the heart size is not enlarged. Our records do not include a previous chest examination; however, a reference chest examination from ___ from___ has been included in our records. This examination, rather advanced emphysematous findings were noted including several areas of local increased aeration, bullae. It is noteworthy that such bullae on the right lung base are now more marked and better visible than on the previous study indicating some increased fluid accumulation in the pulmonary tissue outlining the bullae more clearly. Otherwise, there is no evidence of any new pulmonary or pleural abnormality and the heart size is not abnormally increased.
