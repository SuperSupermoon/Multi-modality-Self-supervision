ET tube, NG tube, right and left IJ lines, and left chest tube are similar in configuration. Sternotomy wires are present, with a gap again noted between the second and third wires. A prosthetic valve is also present, likely an aortic valve. The cardiac silhouette is moderately severely enlarged, similar to prior. Increased retrocardiac opacity compatible with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is similar to the prior film. The left-sided effusion is slightly smaller. Additional pleural fluid and/or thickening is again noted at the left lung apex. There is CHF, which appears increased compared with the prior film. Hazy opacity at the right lung base is increased, consistent with a slightly larger right pleural effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Linear lucency along the right chest wall more likely relax her relates a skin fold, but a lateral sided pneumothorax could have a similar appearance.
