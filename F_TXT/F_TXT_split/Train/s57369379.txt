Endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating approximately 2.6 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is noted with tip likely in the proximal duodenum. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema appears slightly worse in the interval. Layering pleural effusions are again noted with bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly atelectasis or aspiration. No large pneumothorax is present.
