Compared to the study from the prior day. There has been some slight interval improvement in the lower lobe opacities. However, there continues to be volume loss/infiltrate in these regions. The heart size, continues to be moderately enlarged with mild pulmonary vascular redistribution. There are probable small bilateral effusions, slightly smaller than previous.
