AP chest compared to ___: No good evidence for pneumonia. Lungs grossly clear. Severe cardiomegaly chronic. Pleural effusions, small, if any. No pneumothorax. As soon as feasible, I would recommend conventional chest radiographs, to look more closely at the lung bases. Thoracic aorta heavily calcified and tortuous but not clearly aneurysmal.
