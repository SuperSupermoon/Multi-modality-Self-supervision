There is postoperative pneumoperitoneum and a mild left pneumothorax with ipsilateral subcutaneous emphysema. An enteric tube terminates in the distal neo esophagus. A chest tube projects over the lateral left lung. Apparent cardiac silhouette enlargement is likely exaggerated by AP projection and is probably normal. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable.
