In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval change. Again there are low lung volumes that accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. There is mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Dense band of atelectasis is seen at the right base with blunting of the costophrenic angle. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleurally fusion. The right IJ catheter again extends to the lower SVC.
