evaluation of the lungs is obscured by very heavy soft tissue, a particular problem with bedside radiographic technique. Heart is mildly enlarged. Upper lungs are clear. There is some engorgement of pulmonary vessels as well as mediastinal veins consistent with volume overload but there is no pulmonary edema. Lower lobes are difficult to assess but grossly clear. If there is series concern about cardiopulmonary structures, CT scanning is band be required
