Upper enteric drainage tube has been advanced beyond the mid stomach and out of view. Severe extensive pulmonary consolidation has not improved since earlier in the day. Small right pleural effusion stable. No pneumothorax. Moderate cardiac enlargement, unchanged. Of note, high attenuation values of consolidation on the subsequent chest CT increase the likelihood of widespread pulmonary hemorrhage.
