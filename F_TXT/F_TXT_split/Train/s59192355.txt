AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Marked cardiomegaly as before. No typical configurational abnormality is seen. Findings are therefore compatible with a diffuse enlargement of all heart chambers. No change in appearance of thoracic aorta. The pulmonary vasculature again demonstrates a typical upper zone re-distribution pattern and considerable perivascular haze in the lung bases. These findings may have regressed slightly. The previously identified and suspected density on the right base has resolved. On the other hand, one observes now a crowded pulmonary vasculature on the left base in the retrocardiac space, a finding which coincides with partial obliteration of the diaphragmatic contour and thus suggestive of an atelectasis in the left lower lobe posterior segment. As the lateral pleural sinus is still visible, the radiograph cannot make the diagnosis of pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is present in the apical area.
