Mild interstitial edema has been developing over the past two days, though does not look severe enough to explain respiratory insufficiency. Nevertheless, there is a small right pleural effusion that was not present three days ago and there is bibasilar peribronchial opacification in areas that were previously clear. Heart size remains normal. Consideration should be given to noncardiac causes of edema, which can produce more profound respiratory insufficiency than the radiographic findings would suggest. These include pulmonary drug reactions, or sequelae to transfusion of blood products. ICU physician was paged 9:30 a.m.
