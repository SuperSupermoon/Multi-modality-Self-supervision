As compared to ___ chest radiograph, there is new homogeneous opacity in the left retrocardiac region, likely due to a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion but coexisting aspiration is also possible. Small to moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent basilar atelectasis is also new. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
