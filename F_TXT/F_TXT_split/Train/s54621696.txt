1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC, unchanged. Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet unchanged. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 2. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in positioning between studies. There are persistent layering bilateral effusions with some patchy opacities likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. The aorta remains unfolded and tortuous. No overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
