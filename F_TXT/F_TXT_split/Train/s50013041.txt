This film was submitted for interpretation on ___ at 4:45 p.m. (unclear if prior dictation was lost). Many subsequent chest x-rays and a chest CT have been performed in the interval. The ET tube is 9 cm above the carina. There is a right-sided chest tube. There is near-complete opacity of the right hemithorax likely due to layering effusion and right sided collapse. There is right subcutaneous emphysema. Heart is mildly enlarged. NG tube tip is in the stomach. There is mild pulmonary vascular redistribution with the left lateral lower lung being relatively spared. Compared to the prior study, the opacity in the right hemithorax has dramatically increased. Subsequent film from two hours later again documented the right lung collapse and associated right pleural effusion.
