A single AP radiograph of the chest was acquired. A trauma board slightly limits evaluation. The right costophrenic angle is excluded from this radiograph. The lungs are clear. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. There is marked dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine. L1 burst fracture better appreciated on subsequent CT. Aortic calcifications are noted.
