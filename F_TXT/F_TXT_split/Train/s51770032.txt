Single portable AP chest radiograph was provided. Lungs are well expanded. They appear hyperlucent with increased reticulation, likely representing emphysema. No large focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacities are incompletely evaluated and may be normal but difficult to evaluate on this single projection. There are calcifications of the aorta. The bones are osteopenic.
