Single portable view of the chest compared to previous exam from ___ and CT performed earlier the same day. There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube whose tip is at the apex. There is persistent retrocardiac opacity, presumably residual hydrothorax. No definite pneumothorax is identified. Streaky right mid lung opacity is likely atelectasis. Post-surgical changes seen in the left humeral head.
