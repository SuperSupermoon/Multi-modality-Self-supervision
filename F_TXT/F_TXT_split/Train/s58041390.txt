Patient has had median sternotomy and at least multiple saphenous bypass grafts. Cardiomegaly is moderate and pulmonary vasculature mildly engorged. It is difficult to exclude mild edema in the absence of previous comparison chest radiographs, but pulmonary edema is minimal if any. Pleural effusions may be present but are not large. There is no pneumothorax.
