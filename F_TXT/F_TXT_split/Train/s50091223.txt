Lung volumes have improved. Mild to moderate interstitial pulmonary abnormality has changed in distribution, and improved slightly over night. Since chronic cardiomegaly is accompanied by mediastinal venous engorgement, I suggest the abnormality is largely edema. There is now the suggestion of lung nodules that could have been present but obscured previous. Conventional radiographs recommended when feasible. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax.
