Lung volumes remain very low, exaggerating what is probably new mild pulmonary edema. Abnormalities at the lung bases are more likely atelectasis than pneumonia but aspiration could be responsible. Heart is not enlarged. Pleural effusions could be present but are not large. No pneumothorax. ET tube in standard placement.
