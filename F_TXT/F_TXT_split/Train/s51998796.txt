A portable AP supine radiograph of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube remains 8 cm above the carina. Malpositioned right subclavian line has been removed and a left internal jugular catheter is now seen with the tip in the mid SVC. Cardiomediastinal contour is stable. Dense airspace opacities in the mid to lower lung zones bilaterally are largely unchanged and consistent with pneumonia. Small bilateral effusions are stable. There is no pneumothorax.
