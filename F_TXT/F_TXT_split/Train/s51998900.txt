AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable supine chest examination of the same day. During the interval, a left-sided chest tube has been placed and entered into the lateral chest wall in the costal interval 6 to 7. Chest tube is directed in dorsal inferior direction and projects now on the frontal view in paraspinal position at the level of the eleventh vertebral body of the thoracic spine. This indicates position in the posterior pleural sinus. There is no evidence of remaining pleural effusion blunting the lateral pleural sinus, but the previously described pleural density cap surrounding the apical area remains unchanged. The scattered parenchymal infiltrates in the mid lung field have normalized, but the left lower lobe atelectasis with parenchymal density is clearly present and demonstrated by the presence of a spontaneous air bronchogram in the left lower lobe. Size of this abnormality is practically unchanged and stable.
