Portable semi erect frontal image of the chest. Of note, the right costophrenic angle is excluded from this study. The pacemaker is seen overlying the left chest with intact leads in appropriate position. Lung volumes are low with associated bronchovascular crowding. A subtle opacity is seen in the right upper lobe, likely representing residual changes from prior pneumonia. The lungs otherwise clear. There is no visualized pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable from prior exam.
