Right Port-A-Cath and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position. Persistent, possibly slightly smaller, left effusion with no evidence of pneumothorax. Retrocardiac consolidation suggestive of compressive atelectasis given the effusion. Superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. Streaky opacities at the right base likely reflect atelectasis. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pulmonary edema.
