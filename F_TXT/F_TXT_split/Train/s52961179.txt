1. Interval tracheostomy with the tip of the tracheostomy tube 4.3 cm above the carina. Right subclavian central line with its tip unchanged at the cavoatrial junction. Interval removal of the nasogastric tube. 2. Persistent low lung volumes with linear opacity at the right base likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis and patchy opacity at the left base, also likely representing partial lower lobe atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
