One portable semi-erect AP view of the chest. Endotracheal tube ends 5.5 cm from the carina. Right internal jugular line ends in the low SVC. Left internal jugular line ends in the mid to low SVC. The feeding tube ends out of view. Another line is seen ending in the distal esophagus. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. The bilateral lung parenchyma demonstrate distortion and scarring superimposed on emphysema. Ther is pleural thickening in the apices. No evidence of pneumothorax. There is likely some mild pulmonary edema. Right upper lobe, right middle lower lobe, and left upper lobe parenchymal opacities are unchanged.
