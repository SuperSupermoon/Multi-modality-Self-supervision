No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen. No supine evidence of pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion is identified. The heart size is top normal. Fullness of the mediastinum is presumably related to positioning. There are remote right sided rib fractures. An endotracheal tube is in standard position with tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. An esophageal catheter is in place with tip within the stomach and side port at or just beyond the expected location of the gastroesophageal junction. A dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is in standard position. The patient is status post median sternotomy.
