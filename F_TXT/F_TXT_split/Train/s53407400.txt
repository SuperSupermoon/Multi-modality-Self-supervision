Comparison of current AP portable study with previous conventional PA chest radiographs is limited by the differences in technique. There may have been improvement in the left upper lobe component of severe widespread bronchogenic infection and there is a suggestion of a new region of right axillary abnormality projecting over the third rib anteriorly. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Hilar and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
