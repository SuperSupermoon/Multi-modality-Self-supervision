The left internal jugular vascular sheath has been replaced, with the previously noted kinking no longer visualized. The tip of the vascular sheath terminates in the low left internal jugular vein. The endotracheal and enteric tubes remain in unchanged positions. Remainder of the examination is unchanged with continued low lung volumes, possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral basilar atelectasis.
