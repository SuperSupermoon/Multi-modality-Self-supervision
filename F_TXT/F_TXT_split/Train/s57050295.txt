Rotated positioning. The carina is not well delineated, but the tip of the ET tube probably lies approximately 2.9 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip overlying the gastric fundus. A side-port, if present is not well visualized. There are bilateral chest tubes. Note is made of acute angulation of the left chest tube similar to the prior study. No obvious pneumothorax is identified, though a small pneumothorax, particularly on the right side, would be difficult to exclude. Again seen is dense consolidation in the right upper lobe, with air bronchograms. There is also increased retrocardiac density, with air bronchograms, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Lateral to the cardiac silhouette, the left lung base is grossly clear. There is atelectasis at the right lung base, with elevated right hemidiaphragm. The remainder of left lung is grossly clear. Multiple rib fractures are present bilaterally, more completely delineated on yesterday's chest CT scan. No gross pleural effusion is identified. Note is made of sigmoid scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine, convex right in the midthoracic and convex left in the lumbar spine. The patient's known midthoracic spine the fracture corresponds to poor visualization of the cortical contours of the T6 vertebral body, but is much better delineated on yesterday's chest CT scan.
