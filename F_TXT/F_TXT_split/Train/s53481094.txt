Endotracheal tube remains in standard position. Heart size and pulmonary vascularity are normal. Although previously present opacity at the right lung base has nearly cleared, new poorly defined opacities have developed in the right juxtahilar region and possibly in the adjacent right upper lobe. These findings are nonspecific, but could be due to clinically suspected aspiration. Within the left lung, improved atelectasis is present at the left lung base with a persistent small left pleural effusion.
