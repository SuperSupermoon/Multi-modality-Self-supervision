Again seen is a left chest tunneled hemodialysis/pheresis catheter. Multiple median sternotomy wires are re- demonstrated. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable and within normal limits. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. There are low lung volumes. Linear opacities at the lung bases are consistent with atelectasis. There is a chronic interstitial pulmonary abnormality most conspicuous at the lung bases. There is no focal lung consolidation, however subtle superimposed infectious process is difficult to exclude given underlying lung abnormalities. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
