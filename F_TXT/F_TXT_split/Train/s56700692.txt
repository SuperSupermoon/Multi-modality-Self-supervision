In comparison with the study of ___, there is again hyperinflation of the lungs consistent with the clinical diagnosis of COPD. The cardiac silhouette is unchanged. There is increased prominence of engorged pulmonary interstitial markings, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification again suggests volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
