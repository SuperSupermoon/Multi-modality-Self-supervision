ICD pacing device is present, with interval placement of a new right atrial lead within expected location in the right atrium. Standard PA and lateral chest radiograph may be helpful to confirm appropriate localization when the patient's condition allows. Note is also made of an abandoned fractured lead overlying the left upper mediastinum. Lateral chest radiograph would be helpful to better localize this as well. There is no pneumothorax. Stable cardiomegaly, with interval resolution of interstitial edema since the prior radiograph.
