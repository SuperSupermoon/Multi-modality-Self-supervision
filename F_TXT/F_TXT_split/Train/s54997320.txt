AP chest compared to ___, 9:33 a.m.: Tip of the new endotracheal tube with the chin in neutral position, approximately 6 cm or less above the carina is in standard placement. Tube caliber is approximately half the diameter of the trachea, which may account for mild overdistention of the cuff whose upper margin is defined by pooled secretions. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. An orogastric tube ends in the distal portion of non-distended stomach. Transvenous right atrial and left ventricular pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged from before. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
