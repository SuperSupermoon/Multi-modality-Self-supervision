Lung volumes are low. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis but aspiration and pneumonia are not excluded. Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present. Heart size is difficult to assess but is likely within normal limits. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion. No pneumothorax is noted. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
