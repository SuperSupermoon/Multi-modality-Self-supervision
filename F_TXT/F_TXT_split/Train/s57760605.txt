In comparison to radiograph from ___, the patient has been extubated. Has been removal of right IJ central line, as well as NG tube. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are grossly unchanged. There is again seen a calcified aortic arch. There is a right basilar platelike atelectasis. There is left lower lobe volume loss, with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm and increased retrocardiac opacification likely representing left basilar atelectasis. There is indistinctness of the left lateral CP angle which may represent a small left layering pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
