AP chest compared to ___: Large left pleural effusion has not improved, moderate right pleural effusion is smaller. Left lower lobe is still collapsed. Cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged. Right upper lobe is now more readily visible, and if it was previously atelectatic or edematous, that has resolved. No pneumothorax. Transvenous right atrial and ventricular pacer leads in standard placement. Large elliptical opacity in the right lower lung is probably fissural pleural fluid. PA and lateral chest radiographs recommended as the means of initial assessment.
