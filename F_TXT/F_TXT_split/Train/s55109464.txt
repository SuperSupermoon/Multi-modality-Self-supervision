The patient is now extubated. Stable bilateral lower lung volumes, with expected increased bibasilar atelectasis after extubation, greater on the right compared to the left. Mild increase in pulmonary vascular congestion from the prior exam, consistent with postextubation status. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette. Unchanged position of the right PICC line, right IJ catheter, and NG tube. No pneumoperitoneum.
