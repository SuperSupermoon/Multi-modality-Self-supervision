A single portable frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. The patient is rotated to the right. The heart is mildly enlarged, not significantly changed. Widening of the vascular pedicle is not significantly changed. Hazy opacification of the mid-to-lower right lung and lower left lung is likely secondary to overlying soft tissue. There is evidence of vascular cephalization with prominent bilateral perihilar interstitial markings, concerning for mild interstitial pulmonary edema. A small pleural effusion at either lung base cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
