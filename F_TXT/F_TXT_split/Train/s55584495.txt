Chest radiograph is essentially unchanged since ___ when severe bibasilar consolidation and moderate bilateral pleural effusion, traversed by a right basal pleural catheter, were seen on CT scanning. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mild edema is still present in the upper lungs. Widening of the upper mediastinum is due part to lymph node enlargement, occluding one very large calcified node, residual changes of median sternotomy and mediastinal fat deposition.
