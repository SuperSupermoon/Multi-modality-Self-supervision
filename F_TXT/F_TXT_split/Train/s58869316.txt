Triangular region of atelectasis at the base of the left lung is all that remains from previously more severe lower lobe atelectasis. Pulmonary vasculature and mediastinal veins are mildly engorged but this is exaggerated by very low lung volumes. Same is true for the heart, top-normal size. Left PIC line ends in the low SVC. ET tube in standard placement.
