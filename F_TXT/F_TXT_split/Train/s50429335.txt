There are new bibasilar opacities likely representing a combination of moderate right and small left pleural effusions with adjacent lower lobe atelectasis. There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature with cephalization consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. Additionally, cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch are present. No pneumothorax. Right upper lobe mass is again identified with fiducial seeds at the inferior border of this mass. Previously noted ___ in the supraclavicular region have been removed, but soft tissue prominence persists in this region. No acute fractures are identified.
