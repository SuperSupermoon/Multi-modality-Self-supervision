Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Bibasilar opacities are present, with interval worsening in the right lower lobe and slight improved aeration in left retrocardiac region. Although possibly representing bibasilar atelectasis, coexisting pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Small pleural effusions are again demonstrated, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
