AP chest compared to ___: Endotracheal tube in standard placement. Right PIC line ends in the upper right atrium, would need to be withdrawn 3 cm to confidently re-position it in the low SVC. Lung volumes are quite low, there is a severe bibasilar atelectasis, probably lower lobe collapse on the left reflected in leftward mediastinal shift. There has also been increase in mediastinal and pulmonary vascular caliber suggesting volume overload, though I don't see pulmonary edema as yet. Small left pleural effusion is presumed. No pneumothorax. Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at the time of this dictation.
