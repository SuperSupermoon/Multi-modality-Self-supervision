In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased hazy opacification in the right hemithorax, consistent with worsening pleural effusion. Mild pleural effusion and atelectasis are seen at the left base. Right-sided compressive atelectasis is present. The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Port-A-Cath remains in place.
