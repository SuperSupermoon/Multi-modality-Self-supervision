Bibasal consolidations appear worse compared with prior exam. There is also a new focus of a band-like consolidation extending from the left heart margin superiorly into the left mid lung. There is obscuration of the bilateral cardiac margins as well as the left hemidiaphragms. There might be a small left-sided pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Aortic knob calcifications are present. Evidence of prior vertebroplasties is noted in the thoracic spine.
