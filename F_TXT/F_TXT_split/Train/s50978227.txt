The ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina. The heart size and mediastinum are unchanged including cardiomegaly. Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate. Vascular engorgement is mild. Overall, no substantial interval change demonstrated. The large thyroid gland contributes to the right upper mediastinal enlargement and better appreciated on the CT chest. Pulmonary nodules seen on the chest CT are not seen on the current study but should be followed at least within three months interval for assessment of stability given the relatively large size. Also, correlation with history of malignancy is present is required.
