The lower right pleural drainage catheter has been pulled back approximately 1 cm since the prior radiograph, side hole port might now be in the inter costal plane. The upper pigtail pleural drainage catheter is unchanged in position. The patient is slightly rotated to the right, accounting for apparent rightward mediastinal shift compared to the prior study. Persistent tiny right apical pneumothorax is unchanged, with no evidence of tension. Bilateral basal opacities are stable. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall and bilateral neck soft tissues is similar. Postsurgical changes are stable, as is heart size.
