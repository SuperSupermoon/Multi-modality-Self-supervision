Lung volumes are low. The heart size remains unchanged, appearing borderline enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. There is mild crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Patchy opacities are demonstrated in both lung bases, more pronounced in the left, which may reflect areas of aspiration or infection. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Remote right-sided rib fracture is noted.
