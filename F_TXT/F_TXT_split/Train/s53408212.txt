Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. There is severe cardiomegaly. There are small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. Mild increased interstitial markings and prominent hilar vasculature suggests early pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
