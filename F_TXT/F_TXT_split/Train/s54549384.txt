New poorly defined opacity has developed in the periphery of the left upper lobe, and there is also worsening opacification in the left retrocardiac area. These findings could be due to clinically suspected aspiration pneumonia. Right lung is clear except for right retrocardiac atelectasis. Small right pleural effusion is also demonstrated.
