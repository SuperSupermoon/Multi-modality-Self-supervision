Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There is persistent increased opacification at the left base, likely secondary to pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis; however, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There is evidence of mild to moderate pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. There is pneumoperitoneum present with air below the right hemidiaphragm.
