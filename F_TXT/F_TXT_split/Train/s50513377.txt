Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Severe upper lobe predominant emphysema is again demonstrated, as well as heterogeneous opacities at both lung bases probably reflecting a combination of crowding of pulmonary vessels and scarring based upon correlation of the chest x-ray and CT images of ___. No definite superimposed acute pneumonia is identified, but standard PA and lateral radiographs of the chest would be helpful for more complete characterization of the lungs when the patient's condition allows.
