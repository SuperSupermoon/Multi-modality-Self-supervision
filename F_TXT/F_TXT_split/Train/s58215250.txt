Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, terminating in the left upper quadrant in the expected location of the stomach. Endotracheal tube is not well assessed on this study, terminates above the carina, but possibly just 2 cm above the carina. Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. Mediastinum is somewhat prominent. There is moderate pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion is seen although small pleural effusion is difficult to exclude.
