Heart is normal size and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Lucent appearance of the upper lungs, right more than left, and hyperinflation is suggestive of underlying emphysema. Diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities with prominence of the hilar structures may represent mild pulmonary interstitial edema, however, an atypical infection may have a similar appearance. Opacification of the left costophrenic angle may represent pleural thickening or a small pleural effusion.
