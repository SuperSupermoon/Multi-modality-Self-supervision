AP view of the chest provided. Since prior study, left-sided pleural drainage tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, and endotracheal tube have been removed. Right base atelectasis has slightly worsened since tracheal extubation. Left base atelectasis is stable. There is probably a small residual left pleural effusion since removal of left pleural drainage tube. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Postoperative cardiomediastinal silouette is stable. Right-sided IJ sheath terminates at the level of the thoracic inlet.
