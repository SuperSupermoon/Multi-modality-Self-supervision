Prominence of the hila again seen, consistent with enlargement of the pulmonary arteries and pulmonary hypertension. Core-Valve prosthesis is again seen. The lungs are relatively hyperinflated. There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles, which may be due to trace pleural effusions. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. No pneumothorax or definite focal consolidation is seen.
