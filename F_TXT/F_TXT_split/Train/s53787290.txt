Comparison is made to radiograph performed 9 hr prior. There is been little interval change in overall appearance of the thorax. Two right chest tubes are noted. A right pneumothorax persists, unchanged. Pneumatosis within the right chest wall is less conspicuous. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is suggestive of a small pleural effusion.
