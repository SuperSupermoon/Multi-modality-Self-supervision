Previously seen NG tube has been removed. Right IJ central line tip overlies the proximal SVC, similar to the prior film. No pneumothorax is detected. There is mild cardiomegaly. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, with thickening of the minor fissure, compatible with interstitial edema, likely with an element of alveolar edema. There are small bilateral effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
