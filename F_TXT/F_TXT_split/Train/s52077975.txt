An ET tube remains present, tip approximately 4.7 cm above the carina. An NG type tube is also present, tip beneath diaphragm, off film. Left subclavian PICC line is again noted overlying the proximal SVC. Rotated positioning. No definite change in the overall cardiac cardiomediastinal silhouette or prominent pulmonary arteries. Vascular plethora and and increased interstitial markings are compatible with CHF which may be slightly improved. Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, is also slightly improved. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Small left effusion cannot be excluded. Ovoid focal opacity overlying left upper zone laterally is new compared with the prior study and lies an area of overlying tubing --___ artifact outside of the the patient?
