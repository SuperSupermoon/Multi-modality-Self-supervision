Right internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the region of the proximal right atrium, just below the expected level of the cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Multifocal patchy and linear opacities in the right mid and both lower lungs may reflect atelectasis and or scarring but are not fully characterized on this portable exam. Initial further evaluation with standard PA and lateral radiographs is suggested, particularly to better evaluate the patchy right perihilar opacity.
