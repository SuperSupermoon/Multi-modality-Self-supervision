As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left. Postoperative changes at the level of the right lung apex. On today's examination, there is no convincing evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax. No other parenchymal opacities. The hyperventilation at the lung bases, both left and right, is completely unchanged.
