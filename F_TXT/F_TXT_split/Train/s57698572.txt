The appearance of the right hemithorax is stable with the pleural catheter unchanged in position. A superimposed infection in the right lung cannot be excluded. The left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC. There has been interval appearance of mild pulmonary and interstitial edema at least evident within the left lung. No left effusion is seen. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the diffuse abnormality involving the right hemithorax.
