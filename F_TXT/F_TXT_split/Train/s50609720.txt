In comparison with the study of ___, the pigtail catheter has been removed and there is now a chest tube in place. No evidence of a pneumothorax. The loculated opacification adjacent to the left lateral chest wall has decreased. Postoperative changes are again seen at the left base. There is a streak of atelectasis in the right mid zone. Blunting of the costophrenic angle could reflect some pleural fluid on this side.
