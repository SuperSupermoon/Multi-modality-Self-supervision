Frontal views of the chest were obtained. Widespread bilateral hazy opacities with indistinct costophrenic angles are consistent with severe pulmonary edema with small to moderate pleural effusions. Ovoid calcification overlying the left heart border is consistent with a calcified left ventricular aneurysm. Aortic knob calcification is present. Endotracheal tube terminates 2.1 cm above the carina. Leads of a left-sided defibrillator projecting over the right atrium and ventricle.
