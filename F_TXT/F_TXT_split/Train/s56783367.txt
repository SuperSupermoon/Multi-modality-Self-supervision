There may be a tiny residual right apical pneumothorax. Opacification at the right base is slightly decreased, with continued atelectasis and effusion. Left hemidiaphragm is not seen, consistent with volume loss at the left base and probable small effusion. There is a more coalescent area of opacification in the right mid-to-lower lung that is somewhat worrisome for developing consolidation. The right IJ sheath is unchanged, though there is kinking at apparently the level of skin insertion.
