A left subclavian PICC line is present, at fall is a somewhat atypical course but appears to terminate in the upper/mid SVC. No pneumothorax detected. There are low inspiratory volumes. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Extreme right costophrenic angle excluded from the film. Allowing for this, no gross effusion. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged, appearing stable compared to the recent prior films. The appearance is likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Mediastinal clips noted. Review of OMR indicates a history of sternal debridement in bilateral pectoralis flaps.
