Single portable AP view of the chest. ET tube terminates in the mid-to-lower thoracic trachea, approximately 3.2 cm from the carina. The film was obtained in a lordotic position making evaluation somewhat difficult and the carina is not well visualized. An enteric tube courses through the esophagus to the stomach with the tip beyond the inferior border of the film. There is significant opacity of the right upper lobe with some residual areas of aeration or cystic change. There are coarse interstitial markings bilaterally and reticular opacity in the right costophrenic sulcus likely representing atelectasis or prior scarring; however, aspiration cannot be excluded. The heart is not enlarged. There is no frank pulmonary edema. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
