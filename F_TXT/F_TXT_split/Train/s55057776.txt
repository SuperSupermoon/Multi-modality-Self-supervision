Single supine view of the chest. There is complete opacification of the right hemithorax. There is no significant mediastinal shift, suggesting there is underlying atelectasis in combination with pleural effusion. Right pigtail catheter projects over the right mid lung. The left lung is grossly clear, noting a nodular opacity over left lung base, potentially a nipple shadow. Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic arch. No visualized pneumothorax based on a supine film.
