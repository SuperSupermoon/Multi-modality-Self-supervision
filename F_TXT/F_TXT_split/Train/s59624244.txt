The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is minimally increased opacity at the lung bases which likely reflects atelectasis. Irregularly shaped but relatively linear opacities aligned vertically along the lateral left chest are calcified and most likely represent pleural plaques. Additional regions seen paralleling the left hemidiaphragm and potentially along the right lateral chest wall. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
