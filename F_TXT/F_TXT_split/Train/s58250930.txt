As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left-sided chest tube, obviously to drain the left-sided fluid collection. There is a small post-procedural pneumothorax at the base of the left lung, the pneumothorax has no apical component. No evidence of tension is seen. The tube is slightly kinked at the lower aspects of the left lateral ribs. Moderate areas of atelectasis at both lung bases. Moderate cardiomegaly. Minimal fluid overload.
