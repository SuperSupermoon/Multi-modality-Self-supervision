There are low inspiratory volumes, similar prior. A tracheostomy is in place. A left-sided PICC line tip overlies the mid/ distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the prior film, likely accentuated due to low lung volumes. There is upper zone redistribution and hazy opacity in the right mid and cardiophrenic zones could represent atelectasis. There is minimal subsegmental atelectasis at the left base. No definite effusion. Slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with respect to left.
