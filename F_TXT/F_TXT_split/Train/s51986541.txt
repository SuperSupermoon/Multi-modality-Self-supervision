Right chest tube remains unchanged in position. There continues to be near complete opacification of the right hemithorax likely due to a large pleural collection. There continues to be slight leftward shift of the mediastinal structures. A tiny amount of air is seen at the left apex consistent with a small pneumothorax. Streaky opacities in the left lung likely reflect atelectasis. There is possibly a small left effusion as the costophrenic angle appears blunted. The heart remains stably enlarged. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
