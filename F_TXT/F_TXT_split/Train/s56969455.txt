AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Cardiomegaly is present, moderate. Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is demonstrated and might be consistent with pulmonary hypertension. The lungs are essentially clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The aorta is most likely tortuous. When possible, comparison with PA and lateral views is recommended for better characterization of left mediastinal contour.
