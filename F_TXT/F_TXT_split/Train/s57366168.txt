A right-sided chest tube has been placed. There is persistent moderate-to-large right-sided pneumothorax, but substantially decreased. Of note, however, the contours of the right upper lobe are poorly defined with an area of substantial concavity. This may indicate a substantial defect in the visceral pleura, bullous changes, atelectasis or some combination of these. Persistent short-term radiographic followup is recommended. The left lung remains clear. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is no mediastinal shift.
