Findings are consistent with heart active failure. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. A moderate right pleural effusion, largely fissural best is seen along the costal surface in the lower chest and projected over the lower lung, has increased. Pulmonary vasculature is more dilated bilaterally than on previous exam and there has been an increase in mild pulmonary edema. The left lower lobe is collapsed. There is no pneumothorax. The right IJ line ends in the upper right atrium and would have to be 2-3 cm to end in the low SVC. A band of hyperlucency across most of the upper abdomen, is more likely due to scaphoid abdomen than pneumoperitoneum than, but if there is clinical concern for pneumoperitoneum, a fully upright frontal image is recommended to detect gas under the diaphragm. A Dobbhoff tube ends appropriately in the stomach.
