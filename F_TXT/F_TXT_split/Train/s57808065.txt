Left internal jugular Swan-___ catheter has its tip in the pulmonary outflow tract. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet approximately 5.7 cm above the carina. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. A left ventricular assist device remains in place. There are bilateral layering effusions, right greater than left, with patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. There has been interval improvement in the pulmonary edema, although there is some residual edema on the right. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged status post median sternotomy. No pneumothorax.
