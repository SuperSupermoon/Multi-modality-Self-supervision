AP portable upright view of the chest. Lung volumes are markedly low limiting assessment. An AICD is again seen with leads extending to the expected region of the right arm and right ventricle. Cardiomegaly appears grossly unchanged. A rounded calcified density projecting over the left chest wall likely represents a calcified breast implant. Subtle opacity at the right lung base appear slightly more conspicuous than on prior, may represent atelectasis, though pneumonia cannot be excluded in the correct clinical context. Bronchovascular crowding likely accounts for perihilar opacities as these appear unchanged from prior. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Mediastinal contour is stable with calcified thoracic aorta. Imaged osseous structures appear intact.
