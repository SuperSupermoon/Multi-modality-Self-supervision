The patient is rotated, limiting assessment of the lung fields. Allowing for these limitations: An endotracheal tube ends 2 cm above the carina. An NG tube has its side port in the stomach and the tip is out of view. The lungs are hyperinflated. There are bilateral interstitial opacities, with a reticular pattern and obscuration both the right and left heart borders. Kerley B lines can be observed as well as vascular cephalization. A left hilar opacity is noted. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Heart size cannot be assessed due to limitations in positioning and AP technique.
