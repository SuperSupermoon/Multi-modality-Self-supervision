As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre described parenchymal opacities in the right lower lobe have slightly increased in extent and severity, suggesting the presence of aspiration or pneumonia, as noted in the previous report. A platelike atelectasis at the left lung bases has almost completely resolved. The nasogastric tube was removed, the tracheostomy tube remains in situ. Mild cardiomegaly persists.
