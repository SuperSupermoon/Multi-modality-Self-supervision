The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are not significantly changed and are within normal limits. Again seen is a large right pleural effusion, not significantly changed in size from the prior study. There is adjacent atelectasis at the right base. New, subtle retrocardiac opacity is likely representative of atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
