The Dobbhoff feeding tube is in the distal esophagus at the GE junction and should be advanced. Note that the lung apices are excluded from this film. A right PICC terminates in the cavoatrial junction. There is new opacity in the right lower lobe which likely represent layering effusion. Bilateral parenchymal opacities are stable. The heart size is unchanged.
