A device is again noted in the left hemi thorax with wires coursing toward the neck, which may represent a deep nerve stimulator. The inspiratory lung volumes remain low. On this single view, there is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. Bibasilar opacities are most compatible with atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes although potentially pneumonia or aspiration in the left mid to lower lung. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The cardiac silhouette is accentuated by low lung volumes but likely within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged.
