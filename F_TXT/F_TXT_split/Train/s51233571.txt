Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Heart size is top normal but potentially the size is exaggerated by low lung volumes. Mediastinum is unremarkable. There is elevated right hemidiaphragm most likely due to presence of intra-abdominal potentially pleural effusion. Left minimal pleural effusion cannot be excluded. There is evidence of left minimal atelectasis. Opacity running in parallel to the spine, seen on the prior radiograph and on the current examination is corresponding to substantial amount of varices.
