Low bilateral lung volumes, with elevation the right hemidiaphragm. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion which may be secondary to the low lung volumes. A dense retrocardiac opacity is present which may reflect atelectasis and/or consolidation. No pneumothorax identified. The cardiac silhouette is predominantly obscured by the elevated right hemidiaphragm and retrocardiac opacity however it appears enlarged.
