In comparison with the study of ___, the dense streak of atelectasis at the left base has cleared. Nevertheless, retrocardiac opacification is again consistent with atelectasis in the left lower lung. Less prominent changes are seen at the right base. The left chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube remains in good position, as does the nasogastric tube. The left subclavian catheter extends to the cavoatrial junction or possibly upper portion of the right atrium. The malpositioned right subclavian catheter has been removed.
