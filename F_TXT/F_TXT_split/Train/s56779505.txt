AP chest compared to ___: Yesterday's pulmonary edema has cleared, pulmonary vascular congestion persists, although the mediastinal venous engorgement has improved, either genuinely because the patient is no longer supine. Mild cardiomegaly is less as well. Opacification at the base of the right lung is probably a combination of fissural pleural effusion and atelectasis. As before, the left lower lobe has been chronically airless. Left pleural effusion is small. No pneumothorax. Left internal jugular line ends in the brachiocephalic vein and a right subclavian line at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. No pneumothorax.
