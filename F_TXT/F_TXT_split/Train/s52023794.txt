As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line has been pulled back. The nasogastric tube has also been removed. Pullback of the PICC line is affecting about 2-3 cm of its course. The line currently still has a tip projecting over the mid SVC. No complications, in particular no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the lungs and the heart appear unchanged.
