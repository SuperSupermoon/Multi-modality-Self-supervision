NG tube terminates in the stomach. The left-sided PICC line ends in the upper right atrium, approximately 3-4 cm higher than on the prior radiograph. A double density along the left cardiac border is likely due to a large skin fold. Lung volumes are low, but the lungs are grossly clear. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection. There is mild bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis and trace bilateral pleural effusions.
