As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube in the neoesophagus has been slightly pulled back. The atelectatic changes in the postoperative right hemithorax are slightly improved, with reduction in size of the pre-existing parenchymal opacity at the lung bases, presumably an atelectasis. No new parenchymal opacities. Better ventilation at the bases of the left lung. Projecting over the right cardiophrenic sinus is a radiopaque 1-cm structure, likely contrast material. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
