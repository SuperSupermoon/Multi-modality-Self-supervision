As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities predominating at the right lung base have completely cleared. The only opacities that persist are retrocardiac areas of atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Unchanged blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small pleural effusion. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
