Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. Pulmonary vascular congestion persists, but bilateral ground-glass and reticular opacities are improving, suggesting decrease in pulmonary edema. A more confluent area of opacity is present in the periphery of the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure, and could potentially represent an area of developing pneumonia. The observed findings are superimposed upon underlying upper lung predominant emphysema. Small right pleural effusion is not appreciably changed since the recent study.
