Cardiac silhouette size appears at least moderate to severely enlarged, as seen on the CT chest, due to the presence of loculated pericardial fluid. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right are increased compared to the previous chest radiograph. Bibasilar airspace opacities appear to reflect compressive atelectasis. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
