A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of nasogastric and endotracheal tubes. A left chest tube is unchanged in position. There is no pneumothorax. Bibasilar atelectasis is slightly increased. Apparent widening of the mediastinum is likely secondary to rotation. The remainder of the exam is unchanged.
