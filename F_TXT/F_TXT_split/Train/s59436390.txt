In comparison with the study of ___, the right upper lobe collapse has virtually cleared. Dense streak is seen in the region of the normal position of the minor fissure. The monitoring and support devices remain in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. There are lower lung volumes. Retrocardiac opacification is again consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe.
