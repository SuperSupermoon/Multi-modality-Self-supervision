Comparison is made to previous study from ___. The endotracheal tube tip is 1.7 cm above the carina, could be pulled back 1-2 cm for more optimal placement. The right IJ central line as well as the right-sided PICC line have the distal lead tips in the mid to distal SVC appropriately sited and unchanged in position. There is a nasogastric tube whose tip and side port are below the gastroesophageal junction. Heart size is enlarged but stable. There is vague retrocardiac opacity and there are airspace opacities bilaterally which likely represent persistent unchanged pulmonary edema. Underlying infection would be difficult to exclude.
