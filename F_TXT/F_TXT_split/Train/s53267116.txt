As seen on the prior CT, there is slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with peripheral subpleural consolidation, which obscures the costophrenic angle on the current radiograph. There is likely small amount of fluid adjacent to this as well. The lungs again demonstrate diffuse interstitial opacities in keeping underlying fibrosis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. No pneumothorax.
