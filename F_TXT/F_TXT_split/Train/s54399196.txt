AP chest compared to ___: What was a small right pleural effusion on ___ is now a moderate-to-large pleural effusion. Leftward mediastinal shift is minimal, if any has developed at all, suggesting the right pleural effusion is developing relatively slowly. Although this does not exclude empyema or malignant effusion, it does make acute hemothorax very unlikely. Right lung base is partially obscured by the pleural fluid. There is an equivalent volume of atelectasis replaced by the pleural effusion. There is also new consolidation at the base of the left lung medially, which is either pneumonia or atelectasis. Upper lungs are clear, and heart is normal size. Left subclavian infusion catheter ends high in the right atrium. Dr. ___ was paged at 2 p.m. when the findings were recognized.
