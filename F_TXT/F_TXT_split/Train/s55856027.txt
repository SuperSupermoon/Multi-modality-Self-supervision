In comparison with the study of ___, the kinked subclavian sheath has been removed. Other monitoring and support devices remain in place. The hazy opacifications bilaterally at the bases are less prominent. This probably reflects redistribution of pleural fluid in a more upright position. Prominence of pulmonary vascular markings is consistent with elevated venous pressure. There may be a more focal area of opacification just above the minor fissure on the right, raising the possibility of a developing consolidation in the upper lobe.
