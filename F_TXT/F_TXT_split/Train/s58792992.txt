Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a large left pleural effusion with veil like opacity projecting over the left lung. Again seen is pull-through morphology status post esophagectomy. In the right lung, there is entrapped ellipsoid perifissural fluid as well as additional areas of entrapped fluid along the basolateral wall, appearance suggestive of loculatio. Bibasilar dependent atelectasis is present. Allowing for such, there is no confluent consolidation. There is no longer discernable subdiaphragmatic free air.
