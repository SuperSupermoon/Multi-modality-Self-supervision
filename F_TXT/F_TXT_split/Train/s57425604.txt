Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened, and coalescent edema probably explains slight increase in consolidation in the right lower lobe. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not of substantial volume. Right PIC line ends in the upper SVC and an esophageal tube ends in the upper portion of a nondistended stomach. No pneumothorax.
