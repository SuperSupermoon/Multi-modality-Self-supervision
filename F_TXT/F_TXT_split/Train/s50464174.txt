AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. On both images, the patient is moderately rotated to the right. On the present examination, a new Dobhoff line can be identified, seen to pass well below the diaphragm and being located in a probably moderately gas-distended stomach. The chest findings have not undergone any significant interval change.
