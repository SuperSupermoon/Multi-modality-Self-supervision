Comparison is made with prior study performed 11 hours earlier. Widened mediastinum is stable. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. Bibasilar opacities have markedly increased on the right, a combination of increasing atelectasis and a small effusion. Pulmonary edema is mild. Left perihilar atelectasis has improved. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position.
