In comparison with the study of ___, the right chest tube has been removed and there is little if any residual pneumothorax. Little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. The nasogastric tube is been removed and replaced with a Dobbhoff tube, which appears to coil within the upper stomach with the tip pointing downward and crossing the lower margin of the image. An abdomen study would be necessary to document the position of the tip.
