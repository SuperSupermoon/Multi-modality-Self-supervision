Rotated positioning. An ET tube is present, the tip lies only approximately 4.4 mm, immediately above the carina and retraction should be considered. This is in keeping with the wet reading issued by radiology res9ident Dr. ___, detailed above. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. A right-sided PIC line overlies the proximal most SVC. There is a moderate-sized right effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is partial opacification of the lower half of the right hemithorax, which may reflect a moderate-sized effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Faint opacity at the left base is most suggestive of a layering effusion. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular plethora. Scattered vascular calcifications are noted. Compared with the radiograph from ___ at 5:___ a.m., the degree of opacification at the right base has improved slightly.
