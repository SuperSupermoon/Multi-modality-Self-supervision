Compared with the most recent prior radiograph of ___, the lateral left chest tube has been withdrawn and a new pleural drainage catheter entering involve the left lung and terminating at the left lung apex has been placed. There is no appreciable pneumothorax. There is minimal if any pleural effusion. Apical pleural capping is similar to prior studies. Subcutaneous emphysema is attributable to the pleural drainage catheter. There is new opacification of the right upper lung in a configuration suggestive of right upper lobe collapse. There is associated volume loss with rightward shift of midline structures including the distal trachea. There is no focal consolidation or pulmonary edema. A mildly displaced posterior left sixth rib fracture is presumed postsurgical.
