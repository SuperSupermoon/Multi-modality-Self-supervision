Compared to the prior study, allowing for technical differences, there has been little interval change. Again seen is background hyperinflation cardiomegaly, with upper zone redistribution and possible parenchymal scarring at the bases. Also again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with a left pleural effusion, and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. No gross right effusion. Battery pack device is seen with leads extending cranially beyond the upper edge of these films. Clips again noted about the surrounding the trachea at the level of the thoracic inlet.
