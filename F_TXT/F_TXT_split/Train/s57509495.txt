As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube and the right PICC line are still seen. The right PICC line has been pulled back by approximately 2 to 3 cm and its tip now projects over the mid-to-low SVC. In the interval, there has been development of bilateral areas of atelectasis and minimal increase in diameter of the pulmonary vasculature, potentially caused by mild fluid overload. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. No parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
