Frontal radiograph centered at the diaphragm shows the feeding tube ends close to the gastroesophageal junction while the drainage tube passes well into the stomach. The lung apices and the level of the endotracheal tube are excluded from the examination. Severe consolidation involves most of the right lung. Leftward mediastinal shift suggests new atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Tip of the ET tube is still at the origin of the SVC. There is no large pneumothorax. Volume of right pleural effusion is indeterminate given supine positioning.
