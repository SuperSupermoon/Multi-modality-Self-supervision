A moderate-sized right pleural effusion and trace left pleural effusion appear similar compared to prior. Consolidation at the right base likely represents compressive atelectasis, but underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. Heart and mediastinal contours are stable. A right-sided Port-A-Cath appears similarly positioned. Pigtail catheter projects over the right upper quadrant. Additional hardware projecting over the left upper quadrant appears similar on this view. No pneumothorax is detected.
