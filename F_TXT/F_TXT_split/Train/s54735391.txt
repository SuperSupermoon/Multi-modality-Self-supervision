Collapse of the right lower lobe with elevation of right hemidiaphragm is seen, better assessed on CT. There is also right upper lobe opacity, in part due to tortuous vessels and also atelectasis. Opacity along the minor fissure may be due to atelectasis and/or pleural fluid. The left lung is clear. There is no left pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
