ET tube tip is 3.3 cm from the carina. Enteric tube passes below the inferior field of view. Low lung volumes are seen with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings. There is no confluent consolidation, large effusion or evidence of pneumothorax on this supine film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for technique.
