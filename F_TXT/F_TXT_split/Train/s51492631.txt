Opacification in the lower lungs is probably a combination of moderate pleural effusion and substantial bibasilar atelectasis. In that setting common pneumonia is difficult to exclude comp particularly in the left lower lobe. I would recommend evaluation with at least conventional chest radiographs, particularly a lateral view, and if that imaging is equivocal, follow with CT scanning. The upper lungs are clear. The heart is normal size there is no pneumothorax.
