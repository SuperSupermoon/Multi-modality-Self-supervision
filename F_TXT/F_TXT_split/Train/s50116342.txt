AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Lung volumes are still quite low, but pulmonary vascular engorgement and mediastinal widening are more pronounced today than on ___, and mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly persists, with a suggestion of mild interstitial edema, as well as increasing moderate right and small left pleural effusions, all pointing to cardiac decompensation and/or volume overload. There is no convincing evidence of pneumonia in the portions of the lungs, not obscured by the heart. Tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 18 mm from the carina and could be withdrawn 15 mm to prevent inadvertent unilateral intubation. A left PIC line ends at the origin of the SVC and a feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
