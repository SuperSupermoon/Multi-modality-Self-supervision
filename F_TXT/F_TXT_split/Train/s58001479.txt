1. Right internal jugular dual-lumen catheter has been advanced and now has at least one of the tips near the proximal right atrium/cavoatrial junction. The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at thoracic inlet. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There is worsening bilateral airspace disease which may represent worsening pulmonary edema or an acute infectious process. More focal consolidation in the retrocardiac region is again seen and could represent a component of lower lobe collapse. There are likely layering effusions. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall the cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Calcification in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
