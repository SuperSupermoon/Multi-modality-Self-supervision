Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates intact median sternotomy wires. Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No focal opacity. Prominent perihilar interstitial opacities with cephalization is post consistent with mild vascular congestion. No focal opacity. Aortic arch calcifications are noted. Mild prominence of the heart size is likely related to low lung volumes and patient positioning. Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable. Limited assessment of the osseous structures are unremarkable and visualized upper abdomen is within normal limits.
