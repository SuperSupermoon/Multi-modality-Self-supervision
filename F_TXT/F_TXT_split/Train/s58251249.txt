Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pulmonary edema. Increasing patchy opacity at the left base could reflect worsening atelectasis, but given the focality, would be concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. Right lung is grossly clear. Possible small layering left effusion. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-supine technique.
