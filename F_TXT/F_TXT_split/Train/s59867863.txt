As compared to the previous radiograph, the parenchymal opacity has substantially increased. This is stronger seen on the right than on the left, but the progression is clear for both lungs. The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal. There is mild-to-moderate retrocardiac atelectasis. No larger pleural effusions are identified. The left PICC line is in constant position.
