A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a severely widened mediastinum, correlating to the ascending and descending aortic aneurysm and Type B dissection. The aortic knob is not well visualized, and there is rightward deviation of the trachea. There is moderate to severe cardiomegaly. A left perihilar opacity corresponds to the mass seen on recent CT. A left pleural cap and left base opacity represent pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
