As compared to the previous radiograph, the right apicolateral consolidation of postoperative origin is unchanged. Also unchanged is the position of the right basal clips. The aorta continues to be tortuous and slightly dilated at the level of the aortic arch. This change, however, has not increased in severity as compared to the previous image. There is unchanged evidence of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumonia. The nasogastric tube is in unchanged position.
