Heart size has increased in the interim, now top- normal, and the caliber of mediastinal and upper lobe pulmonary veins has increased but there is no pulmonary edema. Heterogeneous consolidation in the right lower lobe, more severe than the left, has progressed. Whether both of these regions are atelectasis or either is developing pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate. Pleural effusion is small if any. No pneumothorax.
