A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The right pleural effusion is still large, but decreased compared to the prior study with improvement in leftward shift of mediastinal structures. Adjacent opacity is likely due to atelectasis. The left lung is clear. No pneumothorax. A right Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position.
