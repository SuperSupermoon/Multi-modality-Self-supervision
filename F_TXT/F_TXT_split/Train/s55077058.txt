Assessment is limited by patient rotation. The patient is status post median sternotomy. Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or overt edema is present, but assessment of the right apex is obscured by the patient's chin projecting over this area. Mild atelectasis is noted in the lung bases. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
