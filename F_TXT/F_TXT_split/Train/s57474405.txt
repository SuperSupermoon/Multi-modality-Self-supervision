AP portable upright view of the chest. Left chest wall pacer device is noted with leads extending into the right heart as on prior. Bilateral small pleural effusions persist with basilar opacities most compatible with atelectasis versus aspiration. The overall appearance of the chest is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable allowing for differences in position. Bony structures remain intact.
