Comparison is made to previous study from ___. Thoracotomy changes are seen within the right lung with resection of one of the upper ribs posteriorly. The heart size is within normal limits. There is again seen atelectasis at the lung bases, stable. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothoraces are seen. There are low lung volumes. Blunting of the right CP angle is suggestive of a small pleural effusion.
