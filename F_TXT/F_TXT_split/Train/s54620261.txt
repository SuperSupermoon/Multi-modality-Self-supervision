An endotracheal tube terminates about 4 cm above the carina. An orogastric courses into the stomach. Pacer pad projects over the left lower chest in addition to other wires that are probably outside the patient. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable within the limitations of technique. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is slight rightward shift of mediastinal structures with patchy medial right basilar opacity suggesting atelectasis. Otherwise the lungs appear clear.
