AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 09:15 a.m. The subcutaneous air appears to be unchanged after discontinuation of the right chest tube. There is questionable small amount of new right apical pneumothorax. Left basal consolidation is unchanged. Overall, no substantial additional interval change is demonstrated with the extensive amount of subcutaneous air, remaining unchanged as well.
