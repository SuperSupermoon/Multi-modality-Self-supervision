The ET tube lies approximately 5.8 cm above the carina, slightly above the clavicular heads. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Left IJ central line tip overlies the distal SVC near the SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen is extensive parenchymal opacity in both lungs, worse on the right. Patchy opacity at the right base is probably slightly worse. Opacity at the left base may also be slightly worse, as left hemidiaphragm is now less distinct.
