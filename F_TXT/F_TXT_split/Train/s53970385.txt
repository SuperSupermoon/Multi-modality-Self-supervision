Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position, terminating approximately 6 cm from the carina. Left PICC tip terminates in the upper SVC. No other central venous catheter is identified. There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with leftward mediastinal shift, compatible with bronchial obstruction and collapse of the left lung. Emphysematous changes are noted in the right lung, without focal consolidation. No pneumothorax. Marked gaseous distention of the stomach is seen, with a biliary stent partially visualized in the right upper quadrant.
