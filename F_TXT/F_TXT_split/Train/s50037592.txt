On the frontal projection, the right lower lobe appears to be better aerated and the previous identified opacity is lower less conspicuous, although there is no lateral projection for comparison. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted. The remainder of the lungs are essentially clear without pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. Stable, mild cardiomegaly is noted. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged.
