The endotracheal tube terminates 4.6 cm above the carinal. NG tube is within the stomach. Heart is normal size and cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is increased opacification at the right the right base with partial obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm with suggestion of a depressed major fissure. Findings can't be entirely explained by volume loss in the right lower lobe; however superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. The left lung is clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
