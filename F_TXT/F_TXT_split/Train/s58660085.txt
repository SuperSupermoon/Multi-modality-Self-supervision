Compared to the study from the prior day, the endotracheal tube has been removed. The PICC line tip projects over the spine but this is felt to be rotational, as the tip was previously seen to be at the cavoatrial junction. There is volume loss at the left base that has increased slightly. There is increased alveolar infiltrate in both lower lungs. It is unclear if some of this is due to volume loss, aspiration or infectious infiltrate. More patchy areas of alveolar infiltrate throughout the lungs are again visualized. Old rib fractures on the right are again seen.
