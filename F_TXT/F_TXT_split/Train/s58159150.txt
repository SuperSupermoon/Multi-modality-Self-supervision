A right pigtail catheter terminates in the right basal pleural space. Trace right apical pneumothorax is little changed. Mild reduction in the now moderate sized pleural effusion with decreased fissural fluid. Heterogeneous opacities seen throughout the re-expanding right lung, consistent with re-expansion edema has improved. Denser consolidation in the right base likely represents residual atelectasis. There is mild edema in the well-expanded left lung. There is no left pleural effusion. A right chest wall Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower SVC. AICD device with a single lead in the right ventricle.
