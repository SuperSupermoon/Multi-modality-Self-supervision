As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. There is newly appeared minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small right pleural effusion. Subsequent right basal areas of atelectasis. Otherwise unchanged radiograph, with normally position monitoring and support devices and mild cardiomegaly. No pulmonary edema.
