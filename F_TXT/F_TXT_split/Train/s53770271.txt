As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the nasogastric tube is slightly changed. The tip of the tube now projects over the region of the pylorus. The course of the tube is unremarkable. The patient continues to carry a left-sided PICC line. Atelectasis are seen at both lung bases, but no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema is present. No larger pleural effusions.
