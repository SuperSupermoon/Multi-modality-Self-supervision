An ET tube is present, tip lies approximately 3.8 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, the tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film.A Swan-Ganz catheter is present, tip overlies the main pulmonary outflow tract. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Patchy increased retrocardiac opacity is similar, but probably slightly worse. There is blunting the left costophrenic angle which could reflect presence of a small left effusion. There is hazy opacity at the right lung base, most likely representing atelectasis. The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the film, limiting the assessment for small pleural effusion. Doubt CHF.
