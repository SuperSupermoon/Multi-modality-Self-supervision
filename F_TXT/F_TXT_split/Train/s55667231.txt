Lung volumes are low. Heart size is exaggerated due to low lung volumes but is appears moderately enlarged. Widening of the mediastinum is likely due to low lung volumes. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
