As compared to previous radiograph of 2 days earlier, pulmonary edema has in approved in severity and a small to moderate left pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size with associated improving adjacent left basilar atelectasis or consolidation. Left hilar mass is again demonstrated as well as left bronchial stents. A worsening patchy opacity at the medial right lung base could reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or developing infectious pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
