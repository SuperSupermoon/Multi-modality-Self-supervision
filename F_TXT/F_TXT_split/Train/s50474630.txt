Right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. A left chest tube remains in place. A tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. There are layering bilateral effusions with patchy airspace disease, left greater than right, likely reflecting atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated, but this could be related to differences in patient positioning between studies as the pneumothorax on the prior study is small.
