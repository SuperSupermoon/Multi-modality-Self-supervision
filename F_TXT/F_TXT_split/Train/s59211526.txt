The patient is rotated towards the left and the chin obscures the upper lung apices, bilaterally. Additionally, lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Within these limitations, there is mild cardiomegaly and central pulmonary vascular congestion. Left retrocardiac streaky opacity likely reflects atelectasis. There is no lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
