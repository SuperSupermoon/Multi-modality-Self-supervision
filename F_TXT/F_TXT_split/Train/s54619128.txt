An orogastric tube is in place and terminates within the stomach with the distal tip not included on the radiograph. Other indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Interval improvement in the left perihilar opacities which may have been due to an acute aspiration event superimposed on multifocal pulmonary infection. Opacities within the right lung remain most prominent in the central perihilar region and have slightly worsened in the right infrahilar and right upper lung regions. Small pleural effusions are probably not changed allowing for differences in radiographic positioning.
