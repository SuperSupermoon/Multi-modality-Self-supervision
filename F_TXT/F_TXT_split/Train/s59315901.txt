Frontal radiograph of the chest when compared to the prior radiograph, shows blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally with veil-like opacities extending from the bases bilaterally, indicating layering bilateral pleural effusions. Additionally, there are increased interstitial markings concerning for pulmonary edema, slightly worsened since the prior radiograph. The endotracheal tube tip projects approximately 5 cm from the carina. The right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter and enteric tube are appropriately positioned. The cardiac contour is unchanged. No pneumothorax is seen.
