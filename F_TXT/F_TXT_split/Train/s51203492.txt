AP chest compared to ___, 5:54 p.m. The right hemithorax is appropriately hyperlucent following bilobectomy. I cannot make out the pleural edge of the remaining lung, which might fill the entire though smaller postoperative right hemithorax. Apical pleural tube still in place, no appreciable pleural effusion. Subcutaneous emphysema in the right thoracoabdominal wall is larger and this is sometimes an indication of air leak. Previous mild edema in the left lung has cleared, which is now normal. Heart size is normal. Upper enteric drainage tube passes nearly to the diaphragmatic level of the nondistended neoesophagus. Epidural infusion catheter in place.
