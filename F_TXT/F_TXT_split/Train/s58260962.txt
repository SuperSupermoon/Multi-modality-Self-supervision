In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there are bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the right, with underlying atelectatic changes. There may be mild residual elevation of pulmonary venous pressure with continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Retrocardiac opacification again is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. The right IJ catheter has been removed. Leads of the dual-channel pacer remain in place.
