An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.8 cm above the carina. An NG type tube is present, faintly seen, extending beneath the diaphragm. A right-sided PICC line is present, tip at SVC/RA junction, apparently retracted compared with the film from the most recent prior film. The right apex is obscured by overlying material, but no obvious pneumothorax is identified. The patient's cervical fixation hardware is again noted. There is prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, similar to prior. There is pulmonary vascular plethora, consistent with mild CHF, possibly slightly improved. There is patchy opacity at both lung bases, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation. No gross effusion is identified.
