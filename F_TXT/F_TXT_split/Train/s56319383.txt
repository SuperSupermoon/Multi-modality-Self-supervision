A left IJ catheter tip projects over the expected region of the mid to low SVC. The patient is status post median sternotomy and the wires appear intact. Opacity in the right upper lung could reflect focal pneumonia in the appropriate clinical situation. Opacities in the right perihilar and infrahilar region may reflect atelectasis. Opacity of the left retrocardiac region and loss of definition of the left medial hemidiaphragm may be secondary to consolidation as seen with infection and/or atelectasis, although a mass cannot be excluded. The heart is probably top-normal in size even on this AP view. The patient is presumed semi upright, however there appears to be layering small bilateral pleural effusions in the lung apices. Aortic knob calcifications are mild. No acute osseous abnormality. Small amount of fluid tracks in the minor fissure.
