Portable supine chest radiograph shows no pneumothorax or acute rib fractures, but note that the left costophrenic angle and lateral lower left ribs are not included in the view of the film. Supporting lines and tubes including endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, femorally placed Swan-Ganz catheter, and right IJ CRRT catheter are in relatively unchanged positions. Bihilar consolidation is also unchanged.
