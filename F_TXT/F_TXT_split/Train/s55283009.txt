Again seen is an apical pneumothorax on the right with a right-sided chest tube. The pneumothorax is slightly smaller on today's study. There continues to be a large amount of right-sided subcutaneous emphysema. Right-sided alveolar infiltrate is slightly increased. There is a small right effusion. There is volume loss at the left base and a small left effusion, but the majority of the left lung is clear. There is minimal pulmonary vascular redistribution. Right paratracheal widening is again visualized compatible with patient's known adenopathy.
