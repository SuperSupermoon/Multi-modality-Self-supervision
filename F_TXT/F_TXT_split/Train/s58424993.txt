Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved, while left lower lobe atelectasis is worsened. Mild cardiomegaly is exaggerated by the markedly elevated diaphragm, probably also responsible for atelectasis in the right midlung. No pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube ends in the right main bronchus. Nasogastric tube ends in the distal portion of the nondistended stomach.
