The entire right hemithorax is opacified, largely due to pleural effusion, but there is also a component of underlying pulmonary edema and atelectasis. This is a dramatic change compared to the prior radiograph performed yesterday evening, which suggests re-expansion pulmonary edema. The left lung is essentially clear. There is no pneumothorax. Left heart border is unremarkable. No acute osseous abnormalities. The VP shunt is unchanged in position.
