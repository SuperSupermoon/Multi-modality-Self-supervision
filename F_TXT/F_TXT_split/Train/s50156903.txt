The left-sided PICC line tip is poorly seen but is likely at the level of the cavoatrial junction and appears to have been pulled back slightly since the prior study. There is unchanged pulmonary edema, left retrocardiac opacity and left basilar subsegmental atelectasis. No pneumothoraces are identified.
