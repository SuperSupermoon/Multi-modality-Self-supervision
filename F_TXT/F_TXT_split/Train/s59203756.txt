In comparison with the scout radiograph from the CT study of ___, there again are multiple left rib fractures seen to better advantage on CT with possible small pneumothorax. There is prominence of central vessels, especially on the right, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure related to over hydration. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small pleural effusion. There has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.
