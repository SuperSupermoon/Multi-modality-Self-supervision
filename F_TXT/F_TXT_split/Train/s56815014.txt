The lung volumes are exceedingly low, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is a 2.8 cm rounded opacity seen in the right mid lung zone, projecting over the posterior right seventh rib. The mass shows central areas of lower attenuation suggesting either air bronchograms or necrosis. Bibasilar opacities could reflect aspiration. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart is normal size. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
