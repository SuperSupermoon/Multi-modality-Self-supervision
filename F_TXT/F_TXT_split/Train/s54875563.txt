In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends into the stomach with the side hole probably just distal to the esophagogastric junction. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist, most likely reflecting severe pulmonary edema associated with cardiomegaly. Hazy opacification at the bases is consistent with layering pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases.
