Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 4.4 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the distal right pulmonary artery, and nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach, although the side port is in close proximity to the GE junction. There remains marked volume loss in the left hemithorax, with a substantial shift of cardiomediastinal structures towards the left. In the absence of more remote radiographs for comparison, it is uncertain whether the left-sided volume loss is longstanding (for example related to previous surgery or chronic scarring), or a more acute process. There remains extensive lung opacification predominantly in the left lower lobe, as well as a moderate left pleural effusion. The right lung is markedly overexpanded, and demonstrates severe emphysema in the upper and mid lung regions. Developing opacity at the right lung base is concerning for an evolving pneumonia in this region. A probable small right pleural effusion has developed, and there is a questionable tiny right apical pneumothorax.
