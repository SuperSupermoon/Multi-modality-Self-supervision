Compared to the prior film , an ET tube is now present, tip approximately 5.8 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is similar to the prior film. Extensive parenchymal opacities are also similar, allowing for technical differences. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles is again seen, consistent with small effusions. Background COPD again noted. No pneumothorax is identified.
