Left-sided central line terminates in the upper SVC. ET tube terminates appropriately approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. Small bilateral pleural effusions are persistent. Mild cardiomegaly is stable, with prominence of the hilar and mediastinal contours, likely secondary to low lung volumes. There has been slight interval increase in mild bibasilar atelectasis. An enteric tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip in the body of the stomach. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
