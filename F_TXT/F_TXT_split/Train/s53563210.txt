Single portable AP view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through with prominent persistent right base opacity seen. Since the prior study, there has been overall diffuse increase in interstitial markings most consistent with pulmonary edema. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle and a small left pleural effusion is likely present. The right costophrenic angle is stable in appearance. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
