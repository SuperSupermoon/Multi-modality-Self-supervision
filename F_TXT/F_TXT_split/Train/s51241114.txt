In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little overall change. Again there is extensive right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis at the base. Smaller effusion is seen on the left. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with pulmonary vascular congestion. Tracheostomy tube remains in place.
