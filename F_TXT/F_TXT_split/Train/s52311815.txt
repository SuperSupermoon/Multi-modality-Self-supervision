A Dobhoff type tube is present, with a radiopaque tip. The tip overlies the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, likely in the proximal stomach. It does not extend beyond the pylorus. No free air seen beneath the diaphragm. A right subclavian PICC line is again noted, tip over distal SVC. The heart is not enlarged. No CHF, focal consolidation or gross effusion is identified. Incidental note is made of mild sigmoid scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine.
