Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position, but tip of nasogastric tube courses cephalad in the proximal stomach. Widespread airspace opacities involving nearly the entirety of the right lung and primarily the perihilar portion of the left lung show interval worsening on the right. This may reflect asymmetrical pulmonary edema with or without superimposed process in the right lung such as a co-existing pneumonia, hemorrhage or aspiration. Small right pleural effusion is present, but there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
