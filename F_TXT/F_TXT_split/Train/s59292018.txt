Semi-upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates an interval decrease in lung volume. Confluent opacity at the left lung base remains, likely reflecting combination of left lower lobe collapse and effusion. Elevation of the minor fissure indicated right upper lobe volume loss. A right pleural effusion is improving. Mild pulmonary edema is improving. The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged, the mediastinal contours reflect central venous engorgement. The endotracheal tube is similar in position, and projects no less than 2.2 cm from the level of the carina. A right upper extremity PICC tip projects in the lower SVC. An NG tube tip projects at the level of the gastric antrum.
