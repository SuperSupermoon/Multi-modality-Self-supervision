The patient is status post previous right upper lobe resection with similar postoperative volume loss and extensive apical thickening on the right compared to prior studies. Widespread airspace opacities in the right lung appear slightly improved in the right lung base, and combined alveolar and interstitial pattern in the left lung appears relatively similar to the prior study. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are probably unchanged. Diffuse haziness throughout the imaged portion of upper abdomen is suggestive of ascites.
