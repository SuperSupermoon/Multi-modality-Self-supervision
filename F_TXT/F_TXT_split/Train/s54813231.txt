Endotracheal tube terminates 5.6 cm above the carina, in appropriate position. An enteric tube terminates stomach side-port not well visualized, likely just proximal to gastroesophageal junction. Lung volumes are low. Linear opacities are present both upper lobes and the left lower lung. Air bronchograms and cephalization suggest vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is partially visualized. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
