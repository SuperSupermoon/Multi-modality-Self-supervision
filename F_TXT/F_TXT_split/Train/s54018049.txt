Interval re-positioning of endotracheal tube, now terminating 4.8 cm above the carina. Placement of right internal jugular vascular sheath, with no visible pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Even allowing for this factor, there is probably mild edema present. Asymmetrically distributed opacities in the left perihilar and basilar regions could reflect asymmetrically distributed pulmonary edema or a secondary process such as aspiration with coexisting atelectasis. There is a probable layering left pleural effusion. Multiple radiodensities project over the abdomen, and may reflect radiodense filaments related to surgical sponges or other simlar surgical material. Clinical correlation suggested.
