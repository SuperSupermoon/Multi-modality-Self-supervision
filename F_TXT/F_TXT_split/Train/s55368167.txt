There has been interval extubation and improved lung volumes compared to the recent radiograph. Bibasilar atelectasis has nearly resolved with residual patchy atelectasis remaining in the right lower lobe and only minimal residual linear atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Apparent rightward deviation of the trachea is likely due to mild patient rotation and curvature of the spine, as there is no evidence of a discrete paratracheal mass on recent neck CTA of ___. Cardiac silhouette is stable in size. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
