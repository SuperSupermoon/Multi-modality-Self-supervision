In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better inspiration. There may be a small residual pneumothorax. The amount of subcutaneous gas is progressively decreasing. There again is widening of the superior mediastinum, some of which may be due to the size of the patient. Indistinctness is seen of the aortic arch. This raises the possibility of post-traumatic bleeding. Engorgement of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Hazy opacification in the left hemithorax suggests pleural effusion with opacification tracking upward along the lateral chest wall. The possibility of this supervening consolidation would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
