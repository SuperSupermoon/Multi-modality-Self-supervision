AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Severe cardiomegaly is redemonstrated, unchanged as compared to the prior examination. There is interval progression of the cardiac silhouette size, thus pericardial effusion is a possibility. Widespread perihilar opacities and upper zone lung distribution is consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema that overall is unchanged as compared to prior examinations. No pneumothorax or interval increase in pleural effusion is demonstrated.
