Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Lung volumes are slightly low with crowding of bronchovascular structures. Patchy and ill-defined nodular opacities are noted in both perihilar regions with peribronchial cuffing, more pronounced on the left. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified, although the patient's neck and chin obscure assessment of the medial lung apices. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
