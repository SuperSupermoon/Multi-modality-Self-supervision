Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.6 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not seen on the image. A right internal jugular catheter is seen terminating at the region of the brachiocephalic veins. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. There are large bilateral airspace opacities, right greater than left. Pleural effusion may also be present on the right. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, although the right aspect of the cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the large right lung opacity. On the right, opacity involved most of the right hemithorax aside from the right lung apex. On the left, there is left mid-to-lower lung large area of consolidation.
