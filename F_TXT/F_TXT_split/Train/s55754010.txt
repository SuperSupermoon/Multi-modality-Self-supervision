As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. The very extensive bilateral interstitial opacities are constant, but the overall radiodensity of the lung parenchyma has further increased. These increase could reflect pulmonary edema or acute exacerbation. No pleural effusions. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
