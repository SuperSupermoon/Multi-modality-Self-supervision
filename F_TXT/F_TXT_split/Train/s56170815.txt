Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Widespread bilateral pulmonary metastases are again demonstrated. Apparent worsening opacity in the left retrocardiac region could potentially be due to a developing pneumonia, given clinical suspicion for this entity. Consider standard PA and lateral chest radiographs for more complete evaluation of this region when the patient's condition allows. Note is also made of a small left pleural effusion.
