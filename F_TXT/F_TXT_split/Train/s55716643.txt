AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lungs clear. Heart size normal. No pleural abnormality. A frontal bedside chest radiograph is not the ideal way to look for pneumonia. I would strongly recommend conventional chest radiographs for areas that are poorly evaluated by this study, such as the lung apices and lung bases.
