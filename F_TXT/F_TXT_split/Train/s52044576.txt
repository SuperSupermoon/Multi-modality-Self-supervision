Tip of the endotracheal tube terminates about 6 cm above the carina, and nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach. Heart size is normal. A bilateral interstitial pattern is new, and characterized by multiple thickened septal or Kerley lines with a mid and lower lung predominance. This is most likely due to interstitial edema but interstitial infection should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Left PICC terminates in the left axilla. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in this patient status post recent central catheter placement attempt.
