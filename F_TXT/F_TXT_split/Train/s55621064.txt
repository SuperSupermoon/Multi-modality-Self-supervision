As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs of bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting centralized pulmonary edema, slightly increased in severity, notably in the left lung. The moderate cardiomegaly that pre-existed persists, as do the bilateral, rather extensive pleural effusions. No new appearance of parenchymal changes. Unchanged monitoring and support devices. No pneumothorax.
