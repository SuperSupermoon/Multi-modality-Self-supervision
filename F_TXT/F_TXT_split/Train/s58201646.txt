AP chest compared to ___, pre-operative study: Mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement and mild cardiomegaly suggest volume overload. There is probably no pulmonary edema. Right ___- and infrahilar consolidation could be aspiration or early pneumonia, but since the right lung base is markedly elevated, I would attribute it first to atelectasis. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. Proximal end of a roughly 17 cm long endograft in the descending thoracic aorta is 5 cm from the apex of the aortic arch.
