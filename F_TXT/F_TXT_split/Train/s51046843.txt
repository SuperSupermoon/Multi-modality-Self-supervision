Compared with the prior film, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed. The left chest tube has also been removed. Additional linear densities are seen over the upper abdomen, but the mediastinal drain and right chest tube may very well have been removed. No pneumothorax is detected. The right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is again seen. The tip as been retracted and now overlies the proximal right main pulmonary artery. The patient is status post sternotomy, with cardiomegaly, which appears unchanged. The possibility of pericardial fluid cannot be excluded. There is persistent increased retrocardiac density with obscuration left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is also persistent hazy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region. No right side no significant right-sided pleural effusion. The possibility of a small left effusion cannot be excluded. Minimal upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. Note is again made of a normal variant azygos fissure . Much of the detail visible on the ___ chest CT is not apparent radiographically.
