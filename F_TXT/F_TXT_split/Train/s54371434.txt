Left subclavian central line is unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is increased prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissues but this is felt to likely represent prominent vascular structures which are accentuated due to patient rotation on the current study. This can be further assessed on followup imaging. Linear opacity in the right mid lung is unchanged and may reflect scarring. Minimal atelectatic changes at both bases are again seen. There is possibly a small left effusion. No new focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia at this time. No pneumothorax.
