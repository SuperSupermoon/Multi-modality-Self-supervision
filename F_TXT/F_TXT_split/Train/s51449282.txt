Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There is mild cardiomegaly, which is unchanged. Again seen is a chronic left-sided pleural effusion versus pleural thickening with some adjacent atelectasis, overall not significantly changed from the prior study. A left-sided peripheral line ends in the axilla. The patient is status post CABG with median sternotomy wires in place.
