Single frontal view of the chest obtained. Right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, distal tip not well seen but likely terminating in the low SVC. A single-lead left-sided AICD is again seen with lead extending to the expected position of the right ventricle. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. Mediastinal contours are stable. Overall, there are relatively low lung volumes.
