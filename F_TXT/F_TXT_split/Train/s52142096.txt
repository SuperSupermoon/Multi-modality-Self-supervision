Right internal jugular central venous catheter continues to terminate deep within the right atrium, and is overlying the expected location of the tricuspid valve plane. This finding was communicated by phone with Dr. ___ at 8:30 a.m. at the time of discovery. Other indwelling devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion, but slight improvement in asymmetrically distributed perihilar opacities, which may reflect mild pulmonary edema. Patchy and linear atelectasis in the right juxtahilar and basilar region are again demonstrated with associated mild elevation of right hemidiaphragm.
