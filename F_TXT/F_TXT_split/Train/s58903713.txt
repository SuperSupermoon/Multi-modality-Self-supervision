The feeding tube has been advanced slightly within the stomach. Other devices remain unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Diffuse bilateral ground-glass and reticular opacities have slightly improved within the left mid and lower lung region. The right lung is difficult to compare to the prior study due to incomplete imaging of the right lung. Healing lower left lateral rib fractures are noted with no visible pneumothorax.
