As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The patient remains intubated and carries a nasogastric tube and the right internal jugular vein catheter. Moderate cardiomegaly persists, with substantial areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung base. In addition, there is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, combined with atelectasis at both lung bases. Blunting of left costophrenic sinus suggests the presence of a left pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax. The mild gastric overdistention has decreased in the interval.
