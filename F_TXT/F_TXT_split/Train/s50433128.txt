Comparison is made to prior study performed six hours earlier. Small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. Small bilateral pleural effusions larger on the left side with adjacent atelectasis left greater than right are stable. Other lines and tubes are in unchanged position.
