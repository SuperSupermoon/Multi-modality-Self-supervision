As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are constant. The cardiac pump is in unchanged position. The lungs remain low, an area of perihilar right opacity, seen previously, is minimally more confluent than on the previous image. This could indicate a minimal progression in pulmonary edema. The retrocardiac atelectasis is constant in appearance. There is no overt pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
