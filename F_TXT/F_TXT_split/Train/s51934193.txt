Widespread pulmonary opacification which progressed on ___ has not improved subsequently. Differential diagnosis includes edema, cardiac and otherwise, and diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, as well as leukemic infiltration provided peripheral white counts are exceedingly high. Pleural effusions may be moderate, but are not large. Heart is borderline enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. Tip of the endotracheal tube ends at the upper margin of the clavicles, approximately 5 cm above the carina ; this is acceptable since the chin is elevated, but it should not be withdrawn further. Esophagogastric drainage tube passes into a nondistended stomach and out of view. Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium.
