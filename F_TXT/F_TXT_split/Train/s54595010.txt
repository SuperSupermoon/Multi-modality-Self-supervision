Low lung volumes are present. The cardiac silhouette size is borderline enlarged. However this is likely accentuated due to low lung volumes. The mediastinal contour is relatively similar compared to the previous exam. There is mild cephalization of the pulmonary vascular markings due to supine positioning, but no pulmonary edema is seen. Patchy opacities in the lung bases most likely reflect atelectasis. Blunting of the costophrenic sulci bilaterally is chronic, and appears to relate to chronic pleural thickening. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities detected. Excreted contrast from recent CT scan is noted within the right collecting system.
