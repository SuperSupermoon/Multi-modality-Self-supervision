AP chest compared to ___. I see pulmonary vascular engorgement, unchanged over the past 24 hours, but no pulmonary edema. There is at least a moderate right pleural effusion, depending on the location of the right hemidiaphragm which prior to surgery was very elevated. The pleural abnormality has not worsened since ___ when the patient was in very mild pulmonary edema. Since that time, mediastinal venous distention has improved. Heart size is normal. Right-sided central venous line, probably a PIC, ends at the origin of the SVC.
