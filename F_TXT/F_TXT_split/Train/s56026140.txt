Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian central line again seen, similar in location. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged. Again seen are is diffuse vascular plethora and alveolar opacity in both lungs, slightly less pronounced in the left upper zone. The overall appearance is similar, but slight interval increase in the right upper zone opacity cannot be excluded. Probable bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
