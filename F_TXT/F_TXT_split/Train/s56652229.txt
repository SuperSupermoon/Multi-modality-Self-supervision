Since the prior study, there has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter, which terminates in the mid SVC. Additionally, a new orogastric tube has been placed, which is not well seen below the level of the midesophagus. Otherwise, the endotracheal tube is unchanged, and in appropriate position. The appearance of the chest is otherwise stable since the prior study, with persistent perihilar airspace opacities and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac enlargement is stable.
