Comparison is made with prior study performed earlier in the morning. Moderate amount of pneumoperitoneum is stable. There are persistent low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities largely on the left side and mild vascular congestion are stable. There are no new lung abnormalities or pneumothorax. There is a small left pleural effusion. Lines and tubes are in unchanged position.
