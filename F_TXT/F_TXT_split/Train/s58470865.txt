Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. A right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, distal tip not well assessed but likely terminating in the right atrium. A right-sided VP shunt is seen, proximal distal aspect not included but is seen to overlie the right chest and visualized abdomen. Lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. There is slight increase in opacity in the right perihilar region, nonspecific. Evidence of lung cancer seen on prior CT would be better evaluated on CT.
