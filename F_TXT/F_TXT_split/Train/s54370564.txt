Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. No prior imaging is available for comparison. There are low lung volumes. Deformities of the posterior right five through seventh ribs are seen, although presumed additional fractures are better evaluated on CT. Per report, patient had a small apical pneumothorax, which is not appreciated on the current study. There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle, a trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. No definite focal consolidation is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are likely accentuated by AP technique.
