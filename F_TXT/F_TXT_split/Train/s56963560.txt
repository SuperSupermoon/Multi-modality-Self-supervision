CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present. The carina is not optimally visualized but the ET tube probably lies approximately 3.8 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present. The tip of the tube can be traced beyond the level of the mid esophagus, though this may be due to technical limitations. There is enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, including the mediastinum itsel,f with enlarged pulmonary arteries, unchanged compared with ___ at 2:35 p.m. There is trace upper zone redistribution, but I doubt overt CHF. There is minimal atelectasis at both lung bases. No frank consolidation or effusion detected. Compared to ___ at 2:35 p.m., the PICC line, which was previously seen coursing cephalad has been removed. No pneumothorax is detected. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
