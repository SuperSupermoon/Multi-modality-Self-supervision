Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by worsening asymmetrically distributed bilateral airspace opacification, involving the left lung relatively diffusely and preferentially involving the mid and lower lung regions on the right. It is uncertain whether this represents asymmetrical pulmonary or edema accompanied by infection or aspiration. Small pleural effusions are unchanged as well as right apical thickening with associated right upper lobe volume loss.
