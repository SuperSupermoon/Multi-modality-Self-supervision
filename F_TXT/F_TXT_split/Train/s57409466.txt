Tracheostomy tube appears to be in unchanged position. Lung volumes are low. Mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular predominance is re- demonstrated. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improved in the interval, without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis however infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded. Previously noted small left pleural effusion appears decreased or nearly resolved. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. A right-sided VP shunt catheter is again noted.
