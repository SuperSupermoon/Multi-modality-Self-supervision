An endotracheal tube ends above the carina. There are diffuse bilateral airspace opacities. A right upper lobe consolidation with superior displacement of the right hilus is most compatible with atelectasis and/or scarring. A retrocardiac airspace opacity is most likely due to atelectasis. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. The heart appears enlarged despite the projection. The pulmonary arteries are prominent, suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension.
