Single portable view of the chest. Endotracheal tube is approximately 3.2 cm from the carina. Enteric tube passes below the inferior field of view, tip not clearly identified. Relatively low lung volumes are noted with crowding of the bronchovascular markings. Lungs are grossly clear. The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged but this is likely accentuated due to technique and low inspiratory effort.
