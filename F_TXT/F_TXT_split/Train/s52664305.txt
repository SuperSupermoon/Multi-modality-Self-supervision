In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased hazy opacification at the bases with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with layering pleural effusions and underlying compressive atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size. Given the underlying effusions, the pulmonary vasculature is difficult to assess, though appears to be mildly engorged. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
