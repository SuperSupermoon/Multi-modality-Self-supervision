A portable semi-upright chest radiograph is obliqued; however, even given this, the cardiac silhouette is large, although unchanged from a prior study from ___. New from that study is some minimal linear plate-like atelectasis in the lingula and right lower lobe with no dense focal consolidation suggestive of pneumonia. When the patient has followup studies, PA and lateral views may be helpful.
