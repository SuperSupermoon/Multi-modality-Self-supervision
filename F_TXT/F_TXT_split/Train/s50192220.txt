A large, ___ x 5 cm elliptical opacity projecting over the left lower lobe is unusual. It could be a lung mass, collapse, or pneumonia, and could also be a fissural pleural collection. There is no evidence of pleural fluid elsewhere in the left chest. Patient positioning is not careful enough to determine whether there is any volume loss to suggest a component of atelectasis. Heart is normal size. Right lung is clear. ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Unless the physicians caring for this patient know the nature of the abnormality, I strongly recommend CT scanning.
