Compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support devices have been removed. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, but small pneumopericardium is still present. There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting the small right pleural effusion. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged compared to the previous image. The sternal wires are in unchanged alignment. Unchanged position of the replaced valve.
