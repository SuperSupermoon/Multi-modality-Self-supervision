Two frontal images of the chest again demonstrate opacification in the left lower lobe with some volume loss. There is a lucency near left costophrenic angle that could represent loculated fluid with trapped air verses pneumothorax verses atypical appearance of stomach bubble. Follow up upright chest radiograph with the patient swallowing 15 cc of barium just prior to imaging should help rule out these etiologies. The lungs are otherwise well expanded and clear. There is no right pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
