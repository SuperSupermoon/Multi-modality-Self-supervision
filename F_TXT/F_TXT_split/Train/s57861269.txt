Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance with persistent slight rightward deviation of the trachea, possibly due to rotation as the patient's neck appears to be rotated on both the current and prior radiograph, but a repeat non-rotated radiograph would be helpful for more complete assessment of this region when the patient's condition allows. Heart size is normal. Lungs are clear.
