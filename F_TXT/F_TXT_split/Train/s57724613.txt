In comparison to prior radiograph from 1 day earlier, a right pleural effusion has substantially decreased following thoracentesis procedure, with small to moderate pleural effusion remaining. Peripheral opacity in right upper lobe is a persistent finding, and areas of atelectasis in the right middle and right lower lobes have decreased in extent. These findings are more fully evaluated by a subsequently performed CT, dictated separately. Post radiation changes in the right paramediastinal region are unchanged.
