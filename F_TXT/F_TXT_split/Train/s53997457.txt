The tracheostomy is in adequate position at 4.4 cm above the carina. The right-sided PICC line is ending in the lower superior vena cava. New increased interstitial markings bilaterally, compatible with a mild pulmonary edema. Stability since the end ___ ___ of the retrocardiac opacity, probably compatible with atelectasis. Mild left pleural effusion. A gastrostomy is seen and there is still a curvilinear collection of air in the upper abdomen compatible with residual mild free air. No pneumothorax. Mediastinal and cardiac contour unchanged.
