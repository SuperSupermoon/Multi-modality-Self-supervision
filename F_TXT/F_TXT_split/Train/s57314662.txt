In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the appearance of the monitoring and support devices. The side-port of the NG tube again is at the esophagogastric junction and the tube should be pushed forward about 5-10 cm if possible. Multiple left rib fractures are again seen with little overall change in the amount of subcutaneous gas. No large pneumothorax is appreciated. Basilar opacification is consistent with volume loss and pleural fluid, though some of this could also represent pulmonary contusion. On the right, a chest tube is in place and there is again extensive subcutaneous gas that is more prominent than on the opposite side and extends well into the neck. No definite pneumothorax is appreciated. There is a fracture of the midportion of the right clavicle.
