New right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava, just above the expected location of the cavoatrial junction. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Allowing for lower lung volumes on the current study compared to the prior, there is otherwise no relevant short-interval change except for development of minor atelectasis at the bases.
