AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Both hila are enlarged, particularly the upper pole of the left, and there is extensive soft tissue in the right paratracheal region, distorting mediastinal contour, all consistent with widespread adenopathy. Right infrahilar consolidation could be pneumonia or atelectasis. Heart size is normal. No appreciable pleural effusion.
