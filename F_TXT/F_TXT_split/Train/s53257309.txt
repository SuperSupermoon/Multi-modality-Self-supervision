AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The Dobbhoff tube tip is in the mid stomach and should be further advanced. The rest of the tubes and lines are in unchanged position. Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance. There is interval development of pulmonary edema associated with bilateral left more than right pleural effusion. Note is made that the left chest wall was excluded from the field of view. Subcutaneous air in both lateral aspects of the thorax is redemonstrated.
