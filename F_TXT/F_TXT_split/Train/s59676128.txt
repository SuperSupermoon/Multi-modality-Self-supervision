Widespread multifocal parenchymal opacities are minimally improved compared to prior examination with dissipation of peripheral opacities in the right apex. There is likely a small left-sided pleural effusion, although it is not substantially increased compared to yesterday's examination. Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position, 4 cm cranial to the carina. A right-sided PICC terminates at the level of the mid-to-lower SVC. A wide bore right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium. An upper enteric tube courses past the stomach with the tip out of view and possibly post pyloric.
