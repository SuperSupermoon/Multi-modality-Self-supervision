Within the interim, the previously seen enteric tube has been removed. A new enteric tube with a weighted tip projects over the stomach. A right central venous catheter is unchanged in position. A right ureteral stent is incompletely imaged. The remainder of the study is not optimized for assessment of the chest and abdomen.
