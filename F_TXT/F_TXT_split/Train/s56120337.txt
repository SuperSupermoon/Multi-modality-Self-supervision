Comparison is made to previous study from ___. PICC line has been pulled back. There is no longer a loop; however, the distal tip is projecting over the axilla likely within the axillary vein. Tracheostomy and feeding tube are unchanged. There is some atelectasis at both lung bases. There is also increased density at the left base suggestive of developing infiltrate or aspiration. No pneumothoraces are identified. There is a calcified density within the right axilla of unclear etiology but unchanged.
