As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. The tracheostomy tube and the left internal jugular vein catheter are constant in appearance. Unchanged left pleural effusion with retrocardiac atelectasis, moderately increased cardiac silhouette and the presence of moderate pulmonary edema. The small right pleural effusion appears to have newly developed. No pneumothorax. No new parenchymal opacity that would suggest pneumonia.
