As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of a pre-existing left lower lobe atelectasis, potentially caused by a small left pleural effusion, has mildly increased. The pre-existing areas of atelectasis at the right lung base are stable. The nasogastric tube and the new right subclavian line are unchanged. The right jugular vein catheter has been removed. There is no evidence for the presence of a right pneumothorax.
