1. Left subclavian PICC line appears to have its tip in the proximal right atrium due to differences in inspiration between studies. There has been reduction in overall lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. However, as the interstitium appears indistinct, this likely reflects interval development of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. There are likely small layering effusions, right greater than left. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in inspiration and lordotic technique.
