AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. During the interval, the patient has been intubated, the ETT seen to terminate in the trachea 5 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax is seen. A right internal jugular approach central venous line terminates overlying the right mediastinal structures at the level 2 cm below the carina as before. The heart size has not changed since the preceding study, thus no significant cardiac enlargement is observed. There is evidence of previous surgery in the right axillary area and soft tissue densities overlying the chest making it more difficult to evaluate the presence of pleural effusion. The lateral pleural sinus remains free as before, both sides, thus no evidence of massive pleural effusion. No pneumothorax identified in the apical area. Chest findings are grossly stable after intubation. DD versus pulmonary embolism versus MI impossible to decide on plain chest exam.. Consider acute chest CT for PE.
