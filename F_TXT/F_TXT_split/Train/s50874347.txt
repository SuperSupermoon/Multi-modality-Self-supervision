The patient is status post endotracheal intubation. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach; its tip is not imaged, however. The heart is mildly enlarged. There are new perihilar opacities suggesting pulmonary edema. A retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms appears unchanged, and although not entirely specific as the etiology, could be seen with substantial atelectasis. Mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is similar to somewhat increased. A trace left-sided pleural effusion is suspected. There is no pneumothorax. Cholecystectomy clips project over the right upper quadrant.
