Very small region of peribronchial infiltration in the right lung all projecting over the anterior right fourth rib is probably inflammation around a dilated bronchus. Heart is normal size and there is no pleural abnormality. There is a very large lobulated lower mediastinal soft tissue abnormality centered at the midline. The most common explanation for this would be a hiatus hernia but there is not sufficient gas in a to make that diagnosis, and there is some aerated stomach below the diaphragm. Differential diagnosis also includes a large lower esophageal mass, less likely aneurysm given the normal contour of the descending thoracic aorta. Prior chest imaging should be obtained to see if there is reason to perform a chest CT to investigate this further.
