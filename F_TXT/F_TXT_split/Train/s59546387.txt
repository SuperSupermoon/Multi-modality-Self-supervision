AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The frontal AP single chest view again indicates normal chest findings. The previously described right-sided PICC line is again identified and seen to terminate in unchanged appropriate position in the mid portion of the SVC. No pneumothorax or any other placement-related complication is identified. As on previous examination, a pigtail-end catheter is seen to overlie the right upper abdominal quadrant.
