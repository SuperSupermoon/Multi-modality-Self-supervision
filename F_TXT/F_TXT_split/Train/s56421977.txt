1. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right internal jugular central line are likely unchanged in position. The lung volumes remain low and there are patchy bibasilar opacities with associated likely layering effusions suggestive of compressive atelectasis. Pneumonia cannot be excluded. Since the prior study, there has been interval appearance of superimposed mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably enlarged given patient rotation.
