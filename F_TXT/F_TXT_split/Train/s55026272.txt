CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. Compared with ___ at 3:48 a.m., no definite interval change. Again seen is a right IJ line with tip over SVC/RA junction. Also again seen is diffuse opacity of the left lung, which likely represents a combination of layering pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Faint patchy opacity in the right lung and a small right effusion are again noted.
