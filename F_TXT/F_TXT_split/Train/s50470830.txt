Greater opacification in the left mid lung zone is probably due to increasing large left pleural effusion. Conventional radiographs would be helpful in distinguishing that from new left lung consolidation. Left lung remains collapse. Moderate right pleural effusion and right basal atelectasis of both improved. The heart is severely enlarged but there is neither mediastinal nor pulmonary vascular engorgement and no pulmonary edema.
