Interval placement of endotracheal tube, terminates approximately 3 cm above the level of the carina. What appears be an enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, terminating in the left upper quadrant. There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion and prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature. Left base opacity is seen which may represent combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, however, underlying consolidation due to infection and/or aspiration is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
