Low lung volumes are exacerbated. A band of atelectasis outlines a substantially larger hiatus hernia. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly has increased as has pulmonary vascular caliber accompanied by new mild pulmonary edema due to cardiac decompensation. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. There is no pneumothorax. It is impossible to exclude early zoster infection, but I doubt that widespread pneumonia is present currently
