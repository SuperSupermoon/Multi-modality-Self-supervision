ET tube terminates approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. Enteric tube extends below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film. Right-sided IJ terminates in the upper SVC. Right-sided PIC line terminates in the mid SVC. Overall, there has been slight interval worsening of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities with low lung volumes compared to the prior exam. Although the cardiomediastinal contours are exaggerated given the technique, mild cardiomegaly is persistent.
