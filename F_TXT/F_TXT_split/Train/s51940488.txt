Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates constant position of endotracheal tube, enteric tube, and right internal jugular central venous line. Compared to the prior study, there is continued mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal contours are essentially normal accounting for differences in patient positioning.
