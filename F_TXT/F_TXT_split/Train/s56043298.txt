AP chest compared to ___: Between ___ and ___, a large region of radiopacity developed in the left mid lung extending to the left hilus. This could be a simple pneumonia, or could be pneumonia distal to a central obstructing lesion. Subsequently, the consolidation worsened and now has a distinct mass-like quality. I would strongly recommend CT scanning to evaluate integrity of the airway. Mild edema present on ___ has improved, but heart is still severely enlarged and the hyperinflation and vascular pattern indicate emphysema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, probably clinically insignificant. Dr. ___ was paged at 10:10 a.m. when the findings were recognized, and findings were discussed by telephone at 10:30 am with the house officer who responded.
