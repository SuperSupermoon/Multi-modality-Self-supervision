There is a faint tubular density approximately 2.6 cm in length, projecting over the expected course of the right mainstem bronchus. This would be compatible with a right mainstem bronchus stent, best correlated with details of the procedure. Again seen is patchy opacity of both lung bases, slightly increased at the base of the right cardiophrenic region. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged allowing for technical differences. Again seen is linear density projecting over the right heart silhouette, of uncertain etiology or significance --? Vascular calcification, surgical material, or residual oral contrast, for example, in the neo esophagus. No new focal infiltrate is identified. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged. Oral contrast again noted in the bowel.
