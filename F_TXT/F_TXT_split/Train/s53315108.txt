As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. There is unchanged evidence of basal opacities, the constant of these opacities in both severity and distribution suggests atelectasis rather than pneumonia. The opacities are most severe on the left than on the right lung bases. The monitoring and support devices and the right pectoral pacemaker are constant. No pulmonary edema. No new parenchymal opacities. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
