A moderate size, predominantly basally located, right pneumothorax is noted with atelectasis of the right lung. There is no substantial leftward shift of mediastinal structures noted. Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated with evidence of TAVR. Hilar contours are unchanged. Extensive fibrosis is seen within the lungs bilaterally as well as emphysema within the upper lobes, similar to that noted on the prior study. No pleural effusion is present. No pulmonary edema is clearly identified.
