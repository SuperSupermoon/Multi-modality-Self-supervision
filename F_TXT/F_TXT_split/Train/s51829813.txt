There has been no recent change in the combination of substantial bilateral pleural effusion, severe bibasilar consolidation. How much of the pulmonary abnormality is pneumonia and how much is dependent edema with atelectasis is radiographically indeterminate. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube, right PIC line, nasogastric drainage tube, and transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead are in standard placements unchanged.
