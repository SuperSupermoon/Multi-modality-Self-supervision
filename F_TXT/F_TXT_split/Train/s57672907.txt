In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the distal stomach. Opacification at the right base medially again could reflect atelectasis or crowding of vessels. In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Minimal atelectatic changes are seen at the left base. No vascular congestion.
