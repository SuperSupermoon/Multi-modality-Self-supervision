As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, combined to a very large cardiac silhouette and bilateral blunting of the costophrenic sinuses, likely reflecting the presence of pleural effusions. No new parenchymal opacities. Normal retrocardiac atelectasis.
