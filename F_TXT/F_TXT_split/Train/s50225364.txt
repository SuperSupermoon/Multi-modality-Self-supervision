Since ___, ET tube has been removed. Small lung volumes have improved and previous mild pulmonary edema has resolved. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has increased slightly but there is no mediastinal widening to suggest bleeding. Left pneumothorax is minimal, along the left lower lateral costal pleural surface. Midline and left pleural drains still in place. No appreciable pleural effusion. Right jugular line ends low in the right atrium, as before.
