As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal improvement of the pre-existing widespread bilateral parenchymal opacities. This improvement is particularly obvious in the right upper lung and the left lung bases. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. Improving areas of atelectasis at the lung bases. No larger pleural effusions. Minimally decreasing in the left lung, but otherwise almost unchanged.
