No previous images. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Endotracheal tube tip lies at about 2.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends at least to the upper stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the image. Of incidental note is a break in the second sternal wire from the top.
