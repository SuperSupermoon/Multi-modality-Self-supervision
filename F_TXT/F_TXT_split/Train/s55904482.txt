As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have substantially decreased. As a consequence, the pre-existing left pleural effusion appears more extensive than previously. There is increased crowding of vascular structures at the right and the left lung bases. Beyond that, however, today's image also shows signs of mild fluid overload. An increasing right upper and peripheral radiodensity is likely caused by the overlying scapula. Moderate distention of the colon and the stomach.
