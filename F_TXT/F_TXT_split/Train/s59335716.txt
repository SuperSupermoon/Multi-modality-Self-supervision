Allowing for technical differences, I doubt significant interval change. ET tube, NG tube and 2 lead pacemaker similar in appearance. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar in size. Vascular plethora, increased retrocardiac density, and blunting of the right costophrenic angle are also similar to the prior study.
