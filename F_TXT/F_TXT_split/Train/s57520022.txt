CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. Compared with ___, the left chest tube has been retracted, though the tip overlies the base of the left lung. A right-sided PICC line is present, tip over mid SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. There are small right greater than left pleural effusions without gross change. Again seen is right pleural thickening, right upper zone opacity, and distortion/retraction of the right hilum. Multiple small nodular densities at the lung apices could reflect pulmonary metastases in this patient with known pulmonary metastases. Mild prominence of the left hilum is unchanged compared with ___ CT scan. Mild asymmetric prominence of the left-sided vessels is noted, without overt CHF.
