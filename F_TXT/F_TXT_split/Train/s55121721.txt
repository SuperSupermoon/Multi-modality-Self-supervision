AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Atelectasis in the left lower lobe helps to explain leftward mediastinal shift and downward displacement of the left hilus. Left upper lung and right lung are clear. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouettes are normal. When feasible, conventional radiographs should be obtained to see if there is a need for CT scanning currently or followup eventually.
