In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube now measures approximately 3.6 cm above the carina. The side-port of the nasogastric tube again is at or above the esophagogastric junction and the tube should be pushed forward a about 10 cm for more optimal positioning. The opacification at the right base may be slightly less prominent. Retrocardiac opacification again could represent substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe, though the possibility of a consolidation on this side as well would have to be considered.
