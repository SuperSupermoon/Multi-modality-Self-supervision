In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration. However, there is increasing opacification at the right base consistent with worsening effusion and compressive atelectasis. Some of this could reflect a more supine position of the patient. On the left, there is similar opacification at the left base consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and effusion. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits, though there is some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Tracheostomy and left subclavian catheters remain in place.
