Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Slightly widened mediastinum is unchanged. Right PICC tip is in the upper SVC. New left lower lobe opacity is likely atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Right lower lobe opacities are chronic, grossly unchanged, a combination of atelectasis/scarring and small effusion. There is mild vascular congestion.
