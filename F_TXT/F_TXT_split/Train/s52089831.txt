Status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. Lungs appear slightly hyperinflated. No pleural effusions pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Subtle streaky opacity at the left base does not appear to be appreciably changed since the earlier exam but could reflect an area of atelectasis, although early pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Clinical correlation is advised and followup imaging may be helpful.
