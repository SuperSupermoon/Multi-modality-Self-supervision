Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. Evaluation is markedly limited due to low lung volumes and under penetrated technique. There is limited evaluation, possible at the lower lungs. There is increased pulmonary opacity which could in part reflect technique, though the possibility of edema or infection is impossible to exclude. The heart and mediastinal contours appear grossly stable. No definite bony abnormalities are seen.
