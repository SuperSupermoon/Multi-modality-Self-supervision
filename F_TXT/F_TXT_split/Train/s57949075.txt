As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The endotracheal tube and the left central venous access line are constant. Constant size of the cardiac silhouette with retrocardiac atelectasis and mild right basal atelectasis. No evidence of acute changes. Minimal fluid overload would be possible.
