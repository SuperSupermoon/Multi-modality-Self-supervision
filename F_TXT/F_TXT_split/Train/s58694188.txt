Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. The patient's face mask obscures the apices. There is a faint patchy opacity at the left base which could reflect atelectasis, although an early pneumonia could also have this appearance. Clinical correlation is advised and followup imaging should be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
