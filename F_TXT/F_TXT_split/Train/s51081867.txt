Comparison is made to the previous study from ___. The tracheostomy and right-sided PICC line and median sternotomy wires are unchanged in position. There is a enteric tube whose distal tip is not well seen and is likely below the level of the diaphragm. The sideport of the enteric tube appears to be at the GE junction and this could be advanced several centimeters for more optimal placement. There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities throughout both lung fields, likely represents a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right side worse than left. No pneumothoraces are seen.
