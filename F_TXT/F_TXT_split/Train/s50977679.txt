Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.1 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach. A left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the upper SVC, unchanged. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are similar. Hazy opacities within the lungs likely reflect layering small to moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right. Opacities within the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. Multiple clips in the upper abdomen are again noted along with an inferior vena cava filter. No large pneumothorax is detected however the left apex is excluded from the field of view.
