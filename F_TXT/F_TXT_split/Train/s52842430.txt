Right lung base opacity is new since the CT abdomen pelvis taken 1 hour prior and cannot be fully explained by expiratory phase radiographic appearance. Confluent bilateral hilar opacities may represent increasing adenopathy. Right upper lung nodule is partially obscured by metallic fiducials. Fiducials are seen in the right lower lung, projecting over ill-defined opacities. There is mild increase reticular opacities, likely due to low lung volumes. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Left-sided infusion port terminates mid SVC.
