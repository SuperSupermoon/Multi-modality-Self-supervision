Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from earlier the same day. Again, low lung volumes are seen. New right IJ line is seen with catheter tip at the RA-SVC junction or potentially proximal right atrium. There is no visualized pneumothorax. Vascular markings appear less distinct compared to prior, suggesting fluid overload. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as are the osseous structures.
