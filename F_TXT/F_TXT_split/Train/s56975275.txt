The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned approximately 3.9 cm above the carina. Opacities involving all lobes of the lung, worse in the right lower and perihilar regions are stable. Heart size is difficult to evaluate given the concomitant pulmonary opacities. Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach. There is no pneumothorax. The right internal jugular central line terminates in the cavoatrial junction.
