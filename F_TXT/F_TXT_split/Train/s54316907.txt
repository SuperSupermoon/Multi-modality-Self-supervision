Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. The left subclavian central line has its tip at the cavoatrial junction. There continue be layering bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities suggestive of atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given patient rotation. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
