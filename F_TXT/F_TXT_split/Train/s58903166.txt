As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carinal. The patient has also received the nasogastric tube, the tip of the tube is not clearly identified on the image but the course of the tube is unremarkable. Unchanged position of the previously inserted right internal jugular vein catheter. In the interval, there is an increase in radiodensity of the lung parenchyma, caused by an increase in diameter of the pulmonary vasculature. In addition, there is new blunting of the costophrenic sinuses, likely caused by a small pleural effusions. Finally, the retrocardiac lung regions have become atelectatic and the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased in size. Overall, the findings are highly suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema.
