An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating approximately 3 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and extending to the right and coiling back to the left of the spine, likely in post-pyloric position. An epidural catheter is in place. The lung volumes are low. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation, significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged without overt pulmonary edema. The mediastinal contours are prominent in the setting of low lung volumes but likely within normal limits.
