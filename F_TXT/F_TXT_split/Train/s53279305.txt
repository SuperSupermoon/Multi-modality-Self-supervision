In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, the patient has undergone recent placement of right internal jugular catheter terminating in the lower superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Postoperative changes at left upper lobe resection site show interval decrease in the degree of opacification adjacent to surgical chain sutures with residual opacity more fully characterized on subsequently performed chest CTA dictated separately. Exam is otherwise remarkable for new bibasilar airspace opacities, potentially due to aspiration or developing aspiration pneumonia. Very small bilateral pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
