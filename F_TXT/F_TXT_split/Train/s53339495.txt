Moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved and is no longer asymmetrically favoring the right lower lobe. Azygos vein is mildly distended, so the cause of the edema could be volume overload or cardiac decompensation. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. Nasogastric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
