Mild pulmonary edema and vascular congestion have improved over the past 15 hr, but consolidation in the right mid and lower lung has worsened substantially, most likely pneumonia. Some right pleural effusion is presumed. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. ET tube, right internal jugular line, and a he nasogastric drainage tube are in standard placements. An esophageal feeding tube can be traced as far as the mid esophagus but the tip is indistinct. No pneumothorax.
