Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification again is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and small pleural effusion. The major changes increased opacification involving the right lung. The hemidiaphragm is obscured, consistent with pleural fluid and some basilar atelectasis. Some of the increased opacification could represent asymmetric edema. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
