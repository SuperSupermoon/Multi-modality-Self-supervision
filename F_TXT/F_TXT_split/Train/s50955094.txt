Single frontal image of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, likely secondary to poor inspiration. Bilateral pleural effusions are seen, as well as some bibasilar compressive atelectasis. There is some slight opacification at the right heart border which may be atelectasis, but in the appropriate clinical setting could also be concerning for pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Sternotomy wires are again noted. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
