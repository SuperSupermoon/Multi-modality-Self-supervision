As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen with regard to the lung parenchyma. The lung parenchyma is markedly overinflated and shows areas of emphysematous destruction, mixed with post-operative and post-infectious scars. There is no new parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions.
