A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained quarterly. The right PICC now ends at the origin of the SVC. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved. Right basilar atelectasis is very mild. Mild cardiac enlargement and the mediastinal silhouette are stable allowing for patient position and technique.
