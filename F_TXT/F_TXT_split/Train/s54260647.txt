In comparison with the earlier study of this date, with the left chest tube on water seal, there is little change in the small pneumothorax in the left apical region. Subcutaneous gas is again seen along the lateral chest wall. Several rib fractures and moderate pleural fluid is unchanged. Again there is substantial emphysema.
