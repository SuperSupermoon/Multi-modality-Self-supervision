No previous images. There is significant subcutaneous gas bilaterally extending at least from the mid abdomen to the lower neck. There is evidence of esophagectomy with the endotracheal tube approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is in place. There is a right chest tube without definite evidence of pneumothorax. Tip of the Port-A-Cath is difficult to see but probably is in the low SVC. Bilateral atelectatic changes are noted and there are surgical clips in the normal region of the esophagogastric junction.
