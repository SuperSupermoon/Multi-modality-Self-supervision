AP chest radiograph. Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip is in stable position. Left upper lobe collapse and small left pneumothorax persists. The left lower lobe is partially opacified but also obscured by the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Mild leftward shift of the trachea is consistent with volume loss. The right lung is hyperexpanded. Spiculated mass seen on CT is partially obscured by the right first rib.
