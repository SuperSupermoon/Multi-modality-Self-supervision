Left internal jugular central line and endotracheal tube are unchanged. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing to the level of the distal esophagus but the tip is not identified on the current examination. There is worsening moderate pulmonary edema. Bilateral layering effusions, left greater than right. Retrocardiac consolidation likely reflects partial lower lobe compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax.
