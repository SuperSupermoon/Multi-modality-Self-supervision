In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial hyperexpansion of the lungs with some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and patchy areas of increased opacification bilaterally. The right apical opacification appears to be slightly less prominent on the current study. Coarse interstitial markings suggest underlying bronchiectasis, especially in the lower lung zones. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia given the extensive pulmonary changes.
