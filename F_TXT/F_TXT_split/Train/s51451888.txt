1. Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. The endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The pigtail catheter and basilar chest tube are also unchanged in position. There is a layering left effusion with associated airspace opacity most likely representing partial lower lobe atelectasis, although a superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax is appreciated. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Heart remains stably enlarged. Mediastinal contours appear less widened, likely due to differences in positioning and inspiration.
