Lungs appear relatively well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. No large effusions. Dense nodular opacity at the right apex is stable since ___ and most likely represents a granuloma. Old right posterior lateral rib fractures. No acute bony abnormality appreciated.
