AP chest radiograph Chest tube is in place with interval resolution of the pneumothorax. The ET tube tip is too proximal, about 10 cm above the carina and should be further advanced. The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach. Small amount of right pleural effusion cannot be excluded given the interval increase in the opacification of the right hemithorax in a diffuse manner.
