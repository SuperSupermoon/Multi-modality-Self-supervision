As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes are unchanged and there is unchanged evidence of a partially calcified large cervical goiter. The main finding, however, is evidence of moderate to severe central pulmonary edema, potentially associated ste 2 small right pleural effusion. The size of the cardiac silhouette has increased. Minimal atelectasis is seen in the retrocardiac lung area. No evidence of pneumonia.
