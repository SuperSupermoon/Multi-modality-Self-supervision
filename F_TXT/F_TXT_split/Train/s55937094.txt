AP chest compared to ___ and ___ at 5:06 a.m.: Lung volumes are lower. Heterogeneous opacification persists in both lungs, more confluent now in the left lung than it was earlier today. Since pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature are more engorged, some of the change could be due to concurrent edema, as well as crowding of previous abnormalities due to lower lung volumes, but possibility of worsening pneumonia should be considered. Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. ET tube in standard placement. Supraclavicular dual-channel central venous line ends in the right atrium as before.
