No appreciable change in the volume of residual right pleural effusion, probably still substantial, although the distribution has changed, more at the base and less along the mediastinum. And basal right pleural tubes unchanged in their respective positions. No pneumothorax. Right lower lobe is probably atelectatic. More subtle observations on the status of the right lung would require CT scanning. Left lung grossly clear. Heart size top-normal or slightly increased. Incidental note is made of rightward displacement of the trachea at the thoracic inlet usually due to enlargement of the left lobe of the thyroid gland.
