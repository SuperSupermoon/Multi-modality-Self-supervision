In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the new Swan-Ganz catheter has been pushed forward so that the tip is well within the right pulmonary artery. There appears to be some increased fullness of vessels bilaterally, suggesting some increased elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Increased opacification persists at the right base with apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour. There may be atelectatic changes at the right base and common in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. In reviewing the study of ___, there is calcification in the tendons of the rotator cuff on the right.
