Comparison is made with prior studies including ___. Chronic loss of volume, bronchiectasis and consolidation in the right upper lobe appear slightly more dense than before. This could represent an acute finding with more bronchial impaction and consolidation, mainly against the fissure. Other chronic changes with bronchiectasis and reticulation and bronchial impactions in the left upper lobe are unchanged. There is increased opacity in the right mid hemithorax that likely represents more bronchial impaction and new peribronchial consolidation. There is no pneumothorax/effusion. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right central catheter tip is in the right atrium, unchanged.
