As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes continue to be low. There are areas of atelectasis in the left perihilar and right basal lung. In addition, the vascular diameters have slightly increased, potentially reflecting mild fluid overload. No pleural effusions are seen. No evidence of pneumonia.
