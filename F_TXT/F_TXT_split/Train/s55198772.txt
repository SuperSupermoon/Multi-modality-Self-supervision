A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes. Bilateral opacities are consistent with mild pulmonary edema. A retrocardiac opacity may be secondary to atelectasis/edema, but a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
