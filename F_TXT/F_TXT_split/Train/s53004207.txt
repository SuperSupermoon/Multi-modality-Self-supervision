Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, with a mild to moderately enlarged heart. Hazy opacification is noted in the right lung base, with air bronchograms. Mild peribronchial cuffing is also noted, compatible with mild edema. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Vascular clips along the left upper mediastinum are unchanged compared to the prior study.
