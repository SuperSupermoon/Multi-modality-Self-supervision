AP chest compared to 11:38 a.m.: Tip of the new left subclavian line ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or ipsilateral mediastinal widening. A right upper paramediastinal fluid collection, either pleural or extrapleural fluid, is more localized medially. Viewed prospectively, it would have raised concern for local bleeding, but subsequent chest radiographs through ___ at 4:39 a.m. available at the time of this review showed improvement. Its precise nature is indeterminate, and dependent on clinical history, (unfortunately) not provided with this imaging request. New opacification projecting over the entire right hemithorax is probably a combination of posteriorly layering pleural effusion, persistent right lower lobe collapse, and new edema or atelectasis in the upper lobe. Of these only right lower lobe collapse is still present as of ___ at 4:39 a.m.: ET tube is in standard placement at the thoracic inlet, and upper enteric drainage tube ends in the stomach. Left lung is clear, and the heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax.
