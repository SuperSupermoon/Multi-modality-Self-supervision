AP chest compared to ___: There has been a substantial increase in the extent of consolidation in both lower lobes, on the left where some of it may be due to atelectasis since the left hemidiaphragm is elevating, but on the right, more likely pneumonia or continued bleeding in a region of previous contusion, perhaps because there is a small unrecognized pulmonary laceration or because the patient has developed a bleeding tendency from delusional thrombocytopenia, DIC, etc. There is no pulmonary edema. The heart size is normal, pleural surfaces are unremarkable, specifically no indication of pneumothorax or pleural effusion, and there is no mediastinal widening to indicate a central arterial bleeding. There may be a very small amount of pneumomediastinum highlighting the descending thoracic aorta, probably not significant.
