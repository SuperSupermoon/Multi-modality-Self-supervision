The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina and the orogastric tube tip is within the stomach. The heart size is normal. The aorta is slightly unfolded. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes. Streaky opacities within the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No large pneumothorax is identified on this supine study. A possible trace right pleural effusion may be present as the right costophrenic angle is slightly indistinct. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
