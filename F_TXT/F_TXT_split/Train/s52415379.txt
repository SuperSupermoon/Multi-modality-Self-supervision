A left pectoral pacemaker with dual leads ending in the right atrium and right ventricle is unchanged. The lungs are hyperexpanded with flattening of the bilateral hemidiaphragms, compatible with COPD. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. There is increased pulmonary vascular congestion from ___ with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities in the bilateral lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
