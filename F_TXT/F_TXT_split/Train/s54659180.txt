Right-sided chest tube remains in place with a medial course of the distal portion of the tube, with the tip overlying the mid thoracic spine. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema throughout the right chest wall reduces the sensitivity for detecting a pneumothorax, but there is likely a small persistent pneumothorax present at the level of the third posterior right rib. This is not appreciably changed allowing for technical differences between the studies. Lungs remain hyperexpanded. Numerous acute lower right-sided rib fractures are again demonstrated. Healed left rib fractures are incidentally noted.
