The patient has been extubated. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava. Although an opacity has partly resolved in the right lower lung, probably in the right lower lobe, there is a marked increase in retrocardiac opacification reflecting atelectasis or consolidation of the left lower lobe including air bronchograms. Associated volume loss is suspected with new shift of mediastinal structures towards the left. There is no pneumothorax.
