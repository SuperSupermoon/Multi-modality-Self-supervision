In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a pigtail catheter at the left base with some decrease in opacification. Nevertheless, there is still evidence of atelectatic change and some pleural fluid at the left base. Specifically, no evidence of pneumothorax. The right lung is clear.
