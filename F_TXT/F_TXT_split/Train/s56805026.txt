Single AP upright portable view of the chest. External artifact overlying the right chest makes evaluation slight suboptimal. Lung volumes are relatively low. There is prominence of the bilateral pulmonary vasculature, worrisome for pulmonary edema. More focal areas of patchy opacity in the right lung as compared to the left could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, but infection or aspiration or not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No large pleural effusion is seen although a small pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable.
