CHEST, TWO VIEWS. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 6.3 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. A right IJ sheath is present, tip near confluence with SVC. A right subclavian PICC line is present, tip not optimally visualized due to underpenetration, but likely unchanged. There has been interval removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter. No pneumothorax detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent but stable. There is upper zone re-distribution and diffuse vascular blurring. There is some increased retrocardiac opacity. No gross effusion is identified. Compared with ___ at 10:57 a.m.,the Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
