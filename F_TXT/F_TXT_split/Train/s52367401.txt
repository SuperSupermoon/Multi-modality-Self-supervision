Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There has been interval decrease in the large right pleural effusion. There is a probable air-fluid level suggesting the presence of a small pneumothorax on the right. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Moderate pulmonary edema has increased. There have been also worsening opacities in the left mid and left lower lung. This could be due to worsening infection and/or edema. Small left effusion has increased. Surgical clips are again noted in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
