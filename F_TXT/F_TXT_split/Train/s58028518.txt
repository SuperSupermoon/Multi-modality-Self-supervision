As compared to prior chest radiograh from ___, an endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina. Right IJ venous catheter tip terminates in the mid to lower SVC. Right upper lobe mass persists, overlying translucency could be stimulated by overlying subcutaneous emphysema. This finding, however raises the possibility of abscess formation. There is persistent subcutaneous emphysema. Today's examination does not cover the complete right upper abdomen, however the appearance of a previously described right pneumothorax is probably unchanged. There is no pulmonary congestion. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
