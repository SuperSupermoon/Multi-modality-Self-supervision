Moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened accompanied by increasing moderate bilateral pleural effusion. Substantial left lower lobe atelectasis has improved slightly. Moderate cardiomegaly stable. No pneumothorax. Marked thickening of the right apical pleural margin should be investigated unless there is a known explanation such is radiation surgery, to exclude a superior sulcus malignancy.
