AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the frontal view of the next preceding chest examination obtained two hours earlier during the same day. Chest tube is now on suction. The volume of the basal right-sided pneumothorax cavity has markedly decreased indicating effective suction accomplished through the tube. On this single AP chest view, there is no evidence of remaining pleural effusion in the lateral pleural sinus. If the volume of the small pleural fluid residual as noted on the lateral view of the preceding examination has been changed can of course not be decided.
