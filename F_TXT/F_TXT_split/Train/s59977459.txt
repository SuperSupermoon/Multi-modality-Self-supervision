An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. On the current film, there is again suggestion of looping of the tube in the hypopharynx. Left-sided PICC line is present, tip likely over the mid SVC. Compared with ___ and allowing for technical differences, spine doubt significant interval change. Background hyperinflation suggests bCOPD. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, similar to the prior study. Again seen are left greater right pleural effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, with more extensive hazy opacity in the right mid/lower zones. There is upper zone redistribution with mild vascular plethora, but I doubt overt CHF.
