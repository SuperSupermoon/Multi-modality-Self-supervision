There is a persistent opacity obscuring the right heart border which may represent a post obstructive process, better characterized on recent chest CT. Lobe peripherally at the right lung base, there is a semilunar opacity without CT correlate and may not be in intrathoracic process. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. There is thickening of the minor fissure with likely some pleural fluid.
