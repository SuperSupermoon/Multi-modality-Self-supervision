The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, the tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach. Unchanged appearance of displaced rib fractures on the right. Decrease in lung volumes with new appearance of diffuse right parenchymal opacities and a small left pleural effusion, combined to a small retrocardiac atelectasis. The opacities on the right require close radiographic followup and could be related to either pulmonary edema or parenchymal bleeding.
