A single upright frontal chest radiograph was obtained. A left-sided chest tube has been removed. There is a miniscule residual left apical pneumothorax. Retrocardiac opacity is compatible with residual atelectasis. The positions of an endotracheal tube, enteric catheter, and Swan-Ganz catheter are unchanged. There is no pulmonary consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Central pulmonary vascular congestion is mild.
