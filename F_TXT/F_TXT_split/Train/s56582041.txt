The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain moderately enlarged, and underlying mediastinal lymphadenopathy as detected on the prior chest CT can not be excluded. There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Chronic interstitial abnormality within the periphery of both lungs likely reflects UIP. Assessment for pleural effusion is limited, but no large pleural effusion is detected. No pneumothorax is noted. There is likely mild bibasilar atelectasis. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
