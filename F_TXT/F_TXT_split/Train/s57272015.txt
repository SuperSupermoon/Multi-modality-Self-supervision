As compared to the prior study of 1 day earlier, widespread bilateral airspace opacities have substantially worsened, and involve the left lung to a slightly greater degree than the right. These findings are superimposed on underlying areas of septal thickening. The rapid evolution of these findings over several days would be most consistent with pulmonary edema, possibly coexisting with aspiration or multifocal pneumonia. Considering the nodular appearance of some of the opacities, the differential diagnosis includes septic emboli, Pseudomonas, and fungal organisms.
