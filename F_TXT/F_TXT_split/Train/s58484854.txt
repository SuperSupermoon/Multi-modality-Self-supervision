Comparison is made with prior study ___. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusions. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There are bibasilar atelectases. Left upper lobe ill-defined peribronchial opacities could be due to atelectasis, but aspiration or early pneumonia can have the same radiologic appearance and followup is recommended. Moderate pleural effusion has resolved.
