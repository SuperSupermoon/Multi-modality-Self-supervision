AP chest compared to ___ through ___: The heterogeneous peribronchial infiltration in the left lung that developed on ___ and improved on ___ is unchanged. However, there is new consolidation at the left lung base medially which since there are air bronchograms is probably consolidation in the lower lobe rather than pleural effusion. The sequence of changes suggests aspiration on ___, which cleared in some of the lung, but progressed to pneumonia in the lower lobe. Right lung is clear. Configuration of the lung base suggests a small subpulmonic right pleural effusion. In the upper abdomen, there is considerable small bowel dilatation. An upper enteric drainage tube ends in a non-distended stomach. Left PIC line is sharply curled as it projects over the upper SVC. It is probably in the azygos vein. Dr. ___ was paged at 6:15 p.m. as soon as the findings were recognized.
