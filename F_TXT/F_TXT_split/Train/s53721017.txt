Mediastinal veins and pulmonary vasculature is more engorged, moderate cardiomegaly has increased and moderate to large left pleural effusion is also larger. Severe left lower lobe consolidation is probably atelectasis. Transesophageal drainage tube ends in the upper portion of the nondistended stomach. There is no pneumothorax.
