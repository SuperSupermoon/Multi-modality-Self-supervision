Increased interstitial markings are again seen diffusely bilaterally suggest mild interstitial edema/ vascular congestion. A more focal opacity at the right mid to lower lung may relate to the underlying interstitial abnormality however, a superimposed pneumonia is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Chronic lateral left lower rib deformity is again noted.
