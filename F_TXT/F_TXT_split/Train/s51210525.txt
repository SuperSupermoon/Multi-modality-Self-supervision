As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC has been pulled back. The line is now projecting at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and the superior vena cava. For a position in the mid SVC, the catheter would need to be advanced by approximately 6 to 7 cm. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly. Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pulmonary edema.
