The endotracheal tube lies 1.2 cm from the carinal angle and should be withdrawn to better position. The tip of the orogastric tube lies below the diaphragm. The right IJ line has been withdrawn to the lower SVC and is in the better position. Some atelectasis at the left base is present, but there is no evidence of failure. Dr. ___ was telephoned and the endotracheal tube has been withdrawn to a better position.
