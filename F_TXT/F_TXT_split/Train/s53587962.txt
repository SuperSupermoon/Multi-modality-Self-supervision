Mild interstitial abnormality has developed at the lung bases, most readily visible on the right laterally. Since heart size, though normal, has increased, this is probably pulmonary edema. Large Lung volumes have been attributed to small airway obstruction. Pulmonary artery enlargement and a very small saccular aneurysm on the underside of the aortic arch were present on the ___ CT but have not changed. Mild aortic valvular calcification was noted at that time and may have progressed, contributing to cardiac decompensation, which, is probably due instead to tachycardia from concurrent viral infection.
