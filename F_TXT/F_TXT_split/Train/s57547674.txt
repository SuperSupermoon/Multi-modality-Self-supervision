An endotracheal tube terminates 3.6 cm above the carina. Left axillary clips are constant. The cardiac silhouette remains severely enlarged, particularly the left atrium, as evidenced by splaying of the carina. Substantial bilateral pleural effusions are slightly smaller on the right and unchanged on the left. Left lower lobe remains collapsed and there is persistent right lung base atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. No pneumothorax.
