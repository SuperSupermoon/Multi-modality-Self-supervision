Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The aorta is mildly tortuous and diffusely calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Remote left-sided rib fractures are re- demonstrated. Calcifications adjacent to the superior and lateral aspects of both humeral heads likely reflect calcific tendinitis.
