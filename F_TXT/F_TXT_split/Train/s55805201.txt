Right-sided subclavian dialysis catheter terminates in the cavoatrial junction. Transvenous dual lead pacer device terminates in the right atrium and right ventricle. Enteric tube extends beyond the diaphragm with tip out of view. Median sternotomy wires are intact. The heart is severely enlarged, unchanged compared to most recent chest radiograph however increase compared to multiple priors. Mediastinal silhouette is unchanged from prior study from ___. New opacity in the right upper lung is concerning for pneumonia, although asymmetric pulmonary edema can also have this appearance. Bilateral hilar fullness is consistent with continued pulmonary edema. Increased opacity at the right lung base likely represents basilar atelectasis, given mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. There is improved aeration of the left lung. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
