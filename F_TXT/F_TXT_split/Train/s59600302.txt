Lung volumes are reduced. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is bronchovascular crowding, and probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky patchy opacities in the lung bases could reflect atelectasis. There may be minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, suggestive of a trace effusion. No pneumothorax is identified.
