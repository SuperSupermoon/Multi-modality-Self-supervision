Since the cardiac silhouette is shifted to the left, it is more problematic to assess the size of the cardiac silhouette. Presence of pericardial effusion is much more reliably documented by echocardiography. Contrast agent in the mediastinal lymph nodes and lymphatic channels has redistributed today compared to previous chest radiographs. There is still substantial left lower lobe atelectasis. The fluid pocket in the left midlung may be smaller. Pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged but there is no edema. Small right pleural effusion is stable or decreased. No pneumothorax. The thin bore esophageal catheter passes into the stomach and out of view.
