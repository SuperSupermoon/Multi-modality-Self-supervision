Severe bilateral heterogeneous pulmonary consolidation has improved minimally on the left, but worsened appreciably on the right. Cardiac borders are obscured so I cannot tell if the heart is dilated, I doubt it. Pleural effusions are presumed, but small. There is no pneumothorax. Left ___ pleural drainage tube in place from the apex of the lung to the base. The rapid pace of pulmonary consolidation and the heterogeneity are most suggestive of multi focal pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.
