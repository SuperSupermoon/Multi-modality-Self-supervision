As compared to ___, the patient has been intubated, with tip of endotracheal tube at the level of the proximal right main bronchus. Orogastric tube is been placed, with with tip terminating in the lower thoracic esophagus above the level of the diaphragm. Lung volumes remain low, and note is made of bibasilar atelectasis or scarring as well as new peripheral opacities in the right mid and lower lung region. The latter could potentially be due to pulmonary infarcts in the appropriate clinical setting, although differential diagnosis includes infection, aspiration and vasculitis.
