Lung volumes remain persistently low postoperatively with associated prominent bibasilar atelectasis. The patient is status post CABG with median sternotomy wires in place and mediastinum does not appear widened. Cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate due to obfuscation by low lung volumes and atelectasis. There has been interval removal of a left-sided chest tube without evidence of pneumothorax. There is no large pleural effusion. A right internal jugular central venous catheter remains at the level of the upper-to-mid SVC.
