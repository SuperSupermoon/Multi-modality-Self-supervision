Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which result in bronchovascular crowding. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are stable. There has been interval improvement in aeration of the bilateral upper lungs. New widening of the superior mediastinum may be related to central line placement, and may represent hematoma or abscess. The central line ends in the right atrium, in unchanged position. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view. No pneumothorax.
