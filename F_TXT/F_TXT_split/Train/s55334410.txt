There is little change compared to a prior study. Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Hilar contours are unremarkable. Mild interstitial edema is unchanged. There is a small right pleural effusion. Endotracheal tube and right PICC line are in appropriate position. There is no pneumothorax. Small amount of pneumoperitoneum is present, likely from recent PEG tube placement and was also present on recent CT examination.
