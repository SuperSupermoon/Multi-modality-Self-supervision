Single portable upright frontal image of the chest. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is again seen, similar to prior exam. The costophrenic angles are not visualized, which may due to technique and overlying soft tissues vs pleural effusions. No focal opacity or mass is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is moderately enlarged, similar prior exam. Left-sided pacer with intact leads in appropriate position is again noted.
