Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to CT torso from ___. Heart size is normal. There is small left apical pneumothorax but appears to be slightly increased since the prior study. Left basal opacity has increased and might potentially reflect contusion or lung hemorrhage. There is no interval development of pleural effusion. No definitive rib fractures identified. The fractures noted on the prior study are not clearly seen on the current study.
