Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study from ___. The opacification of the right hemithorax appears to be unchanged. The pigtail catheter is in place on the right. No interval increase in pleural effusion is demonstrated, but given the decrease in the position of the right hemidiaphragm, potential interval decrease in pleural effusion is suspected. Left basal opacity is minimally and most likely reflecting atelectasis.
