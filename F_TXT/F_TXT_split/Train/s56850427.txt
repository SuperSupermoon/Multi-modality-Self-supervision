AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The biventricular pacemaker position appears to be unremarkable. Of note is slightly unusual course of the left ventricular pacing lead but it was demonstrated to be unremarkable on the subsequent examination. Lungs are essentially clear but there is mild vascular congestion noted, in particular at the right perohilar area.
