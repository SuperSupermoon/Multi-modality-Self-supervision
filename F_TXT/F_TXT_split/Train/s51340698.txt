The endotracheal tube is still low, ending 1.4 cm above the carina and should be retracted to avoid bronchial intubation. The new orogastric tube again is malpositioned in the the left main stem bronchus extending into the left lower lobe. Bilateral lung opacities are unchanged. A gastrostomy tube projects over the left upper quadrant.
