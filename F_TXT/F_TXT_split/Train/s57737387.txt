The mild generalized improvement in the asymmetric infiltrative abnormality of the lungs much worse on the right than the left suggests at least a component of pulmonary edema. Stomach is still severely distended. Endotracheal tube still ends less than 2 cm in the carina an should be withdrawn at least 2 cm. Heart is top-normal size, slightly larger than before. Pleural effusion is small if any. No pneumothorax. There may be a 14 mm wide right upper lobe nodule, partially obscured by edema or pneumonia on this and subsequent views. Conventional chest radiographs should be obtained when the acute radiographic abnormality has substantially cleared
