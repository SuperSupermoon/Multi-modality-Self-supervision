There is a new left IJ line with tip in the SVC. The right IJ line with tip in the distal SVC is again seen. The ET tube and NG tube are unchanged. There is moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular redistribution, ill-defined vasculature and perihilar alveolar infiltrates compatible with fluid overload. Compared to the prior study, the amount of fluid overload is increased. There is no pneumothorax.
