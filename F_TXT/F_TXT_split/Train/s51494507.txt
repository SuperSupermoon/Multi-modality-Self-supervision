As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of atelectasis at the left lung base, potentially combined to a small pleural effusion. Newly appeared is a parenchymal opacity at the right lung base that might reflect atelectasis, given the removal of the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube. Overall, the lung volumes have slightly decreased, which might support this hypothesis.
