AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained on ___ at 11:20 p.m. Since the prior study, there is a slight interval increase in the apical component of the pneumothorax and potentially mild accumulation of the fluid. Right basal opacity appears to be minimally improved. The heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.
