The heart is normal in size. The aorta is somewhat tortuous with calcifications seen along the arch. The main pulmonary artery contour appears prominent. Patchy opacities are noted in each infrahilar region as well as a vague right upper lobe opacity. Although patchy appearance of focal pulmonary edema may potentially explain the findings in the appropriate setting, but they are more typical for pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
