Endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina. Right-sided PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction. An enteric tube descends below the field of view. Lung volumes are somewhat low which accentuates bronchovascular markings. Bilateral reticulonodular airspace opacities are again demonstrated and are minimally improved from the prior study. There is no pneumothorax. No large pleural effusion is identified.
