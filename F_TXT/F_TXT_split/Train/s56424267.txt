Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC, unchanged. Opacity extending from the right upper mediastinum to the apex has not worsened. In the absence of tracheal or mediastinal displacement, I do not think this is hematoma, certainly not active bleeding. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiomegaly is mild. Pneumoperitoneum is explained by recent gastrostomy.
