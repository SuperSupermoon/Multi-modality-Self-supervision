The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain unchanged. There is persistence or perhaps slight increase retrocardiac opacity, which may be related to increase in retrocardiac atelectasis although there is slightly increased opacity throughout the left hemithorax, which might be related to a small layering pleural effusion. A right-sided subclavian central venous catheter is present, terminating at the lower aspect of the SVC at the right atrial junction. Sternotomy sutures are present, and appear intact. Tracheostomy tube is not visualized on this study. The patient has been extubated since the prior radiograph from 1 day ago.
