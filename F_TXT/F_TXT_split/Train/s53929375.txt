Large left pleural effusion is larger, but there is no rightward mediastinal shift. Left lower lobe collapse is presumed. Right lung grossly clear. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has increased due to progressive cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion, a distinct possibility given the ipsilateral pleural effusion.
