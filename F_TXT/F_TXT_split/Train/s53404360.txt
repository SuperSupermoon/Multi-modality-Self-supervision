Portable AP semi-erect view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior studies. An endotracheal tube ends 6 cm above the carina. A Dobbhoff tube ends in the stomach. A right internal jugular line ends in the upper to mid superior vena cava and a large bore tunneled right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the low superior vena cava. Lung volumes have improved and left lower lung parenchymal opacities have decreased. The right lung is clear. Normal heart, pleural and mediastinal surfaces.
