In comparison with the study of ___, there is is little change. Stable pneumothorax on the right with basilar component. Right chest tubes remain in place. Extensive gas is again seen in the supraclavicular regions and in the mid line in the upper thorax and neck, consistent with pneumomediastinum. Left basilar opacification is again consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
