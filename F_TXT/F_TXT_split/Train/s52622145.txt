Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There are lower lung volumes. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema has increased. Mild lower lobe atelectasis has increased. Left perihilar and left lower lobe opacities are grossly unchanged consistent with known pneumonia. If any there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
