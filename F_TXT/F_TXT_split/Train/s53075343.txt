Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles. The enteric catheter is coiled in the fundus of the stomach with the tip likely at the level of the gastroesophageal junction, heading cephalad. Recommend repositioning particularly given aspiration event. Left-sided central venous catheter likely at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. On a background of mild pulmonary edema, multifocal bilateral airspace opacifications may represent alveolar edema versus multifocal pneumonia. There is interval development of a left mid lung large opacification concerning for pneumonia/aspiration. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
