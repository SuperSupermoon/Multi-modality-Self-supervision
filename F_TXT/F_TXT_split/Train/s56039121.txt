1. The patient is markedly rotated, limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. There continues to be layering moderate left effusion and smaller right effusion. A right chest tube remains in place with the tip at the lung apex. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. A left PICC line remains in place with its tip in the distal SVC. Multiple right-sided rib fractures are again seen. No pneumothorax. Retrocardiac consolidation and patchy opacity at the right base most likely represent partial lower lobe compressive atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Interval removal of the endotracheal tube.
