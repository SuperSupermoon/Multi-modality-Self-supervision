In comparison to the prior exam, there has been placement of a right-sided central line terminating in the upper SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube and NG tube remain in appropriate position. A right middle/lower lobe consolidation along with patchy opacities in the left lower lobe are concerning for multifocal pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
