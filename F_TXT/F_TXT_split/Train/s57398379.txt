There is poor lung expansion. Continued bilateral basilar atelectatic changes consistent with prior exam. ET tube is now noted with distal tip approximately 1.8 cm above the carinal. It is recommended to withdraw ET tube approximately 1.5 cm. There is a question of over-inflation of the ET tube balloon/cuff, it is unclear if this is necessary given patient's known tracheobronchial malacia. Otherwise there are no significant interval changes noted.
