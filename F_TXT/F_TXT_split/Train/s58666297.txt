In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing opacification at the left mid and lower zones confined with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm. This is consistent with pleural effusion and substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. Minimal atelectatic changes are seen at the right base. In view of the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and left lung opacifications, it would be extremely difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
