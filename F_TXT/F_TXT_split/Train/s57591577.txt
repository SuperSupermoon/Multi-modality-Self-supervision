As compared to the previous radiograph, pre-existing parenchymal opacities in both lungs have clearly increased in extent and severity. There also is blunting of the costophrenic sinuses, potentially resulting from small pleural effusions. Mild retrocardiac atelectasis. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. The right PICC line has been removed and replaced by a right central venous access line. There is no pneumothorax.
