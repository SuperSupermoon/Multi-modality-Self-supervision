AFTER PLACEMENT OF THE LEFT CHEST TUBE ON SUCTION THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL INTERVAL IMPROVEMENT OF PNEUMOTHORAX AND SUBSTANTIAL RE-EXPANSION OF THE LEFT LUNG. THERE IS IMPROVEMENT IN THE MEDIASTINAL SHIFT. THE MEDIASTINAL SHIFT WHICH IS STILL CURRENTLY PRESENT MIGHT IN PART BE CHRONIC DUE TO POTENTIAL PRE-EXISTING HYPERINFLATION OF THE LEFT LUNG. CORRELATION WITH PRIOR IMAGING IS REQUIRED. PLEASE REVIEW CT CHEST AND THE CORRESPONDING REPORT
