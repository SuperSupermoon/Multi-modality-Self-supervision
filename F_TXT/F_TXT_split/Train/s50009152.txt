An orogastric type tube is again seen, extending beneath the diaphragm off the film. A right-sided PICC line is again seen, tip overlying distal SVC. No pneumothorax detected. As before, there is prominent cardiomegaly with slight unfolding of the aorta. The overall cardiac silhouette appears slightly smaller, though this could be accentuated by differences in technique. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Considerable interval improvement in previously seen bibasilar atelectasis. No frank consolidation. No effusion.
