There is mild interstitial edema but no alveolar edema or focal consolidation. Bilateral lower lobe opacities most likely represent atelectasis. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is calcification within the aortic knob. There is slight widening of the mediastinum and the heart size is top normal.
