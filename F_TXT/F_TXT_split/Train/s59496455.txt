The lung volumes are low causing bronchovascular crowding. Allowing for this, there may be increased bibasilar interstitial opacities. This could represent early pulmonary edema or possibly early multifocal pneumonia. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion and the heart size is normal. The right-sided PICC line extends into the right atrium, and should be withdrawn 5 cm. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
