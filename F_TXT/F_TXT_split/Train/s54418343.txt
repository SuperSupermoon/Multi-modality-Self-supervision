The I unusual contour of the descending aorta or obscuring the descending aorta reported on ___:37 is still present. Differential diagnosis, anatomically are 3 very different abnormalities, left lower lobe collapse, which was seen on the chest ___ ___, juxta mediastinal hematoma in the pleural space, or posterior mediastinal hematoma. Unfortunately the findings on the chest radiograph are not specific. Of note, the contour of the aortic knob has not changed and if there were bleeding originating from the ascending aortic graft, I would expect that to be reflected in a change in contour of the knob. Size and appearance of the cardiac silhouette are stable. Substantial right pleural effusion and atelectasis are unchanged. Severe subcutaneous emphysema, extending up into the neck has not improved and a small left pneumothorax is now evident. Left pleural and midline drains are still in place. Tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter is in the pulmonary outflow tract. ET tube is in standard placement. I discussed these findings at length with ___, at 12:40.
