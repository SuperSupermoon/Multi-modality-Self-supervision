AP chest compared to ___, 5:49 a.m., read in conjunction with abdomen CT on ___, 10:14 p.m. Large left pleural effusion is slightly larger today than 24 hours ago, further reducing the volume of the nearly collapsed left lung, with moderate stable rightward mediastinal shift and probably responsible for moderately severe atelectasis in the right lower lobe. Endotracheal tube is seen below C7, the upper margin of this film. An upper enteric tube passes to the distal portion of a non-distended stomach. Findings on the abdomen CT scan exclude pneumothorax, but no other sort of pleural effusion, including empyema. Dr. ___ was paged at 8:05 a.m. and we discussed the findings by telephone.
