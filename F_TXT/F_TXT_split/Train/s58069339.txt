In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip somewhat obscured by the spinal fixation device. Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the side port is above the GE junction. Left chest tube remains in place without evidence of pneumothorax. Little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
