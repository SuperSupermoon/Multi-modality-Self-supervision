AP chest compared to ___: Given extremely low lung volumes, several determinations are very difficult to make, including the volume of pleural fluid definitely decreased since ___ prior to tube insertion, but obscured by the considerable bibasilar atelectasis. I can say they are not large pleural effusions currently, with bilateral pigtail pleural drainage catheters in place. Also difficult to assess is the presence of pulmonary edema. If there is any, it is relatively mild and unchanged since ___, but improved since ___. Heart remains quite large. No pneumothorax.
