AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging: Patient has had median sternotomy. Heart is moderately to severely enlarged and there is pulmonary vascular engorgement and mild interstitial edema. There is a suggestion of a very large right hilar mass, although dense consolidation could simulate that. Left lower lobe is airless and there is abrupt termination to the lumen of the left bronchial tree, also of concern for bronchial obstruction, perhaps due to retained secretions. ET tube is in standard placement and an upper enteric drainage tube can be traced to the low esophagus, though the tip is indistinct. A left-sided vascular line in the neck does not follow the course of central vein and possibilities are that it cannulates either small vein, artery, or may be entirely extravascular. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not new. Dr. ___ and I discussed these findings by telephone at 11:45 a.m. and he told me that the intended left-sided central line returns venous blood, and that the patient had four additional chest radiographs under a different identification yesterday. As soon as he can provide more information, I will look for prior radiographs to assess current findings.
