The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal contours show no widening and demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease at the aortic knob. The lungs are hyperinflated and demonstrate ill-defined airspace opacities affecting the left upper lung and probably the right lung base as well; areas of lucency in the right upper lung represent underlying emphysema. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Minimal scoliosis is present in the thoracic spine.
