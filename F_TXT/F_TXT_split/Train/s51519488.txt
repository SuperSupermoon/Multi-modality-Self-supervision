As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Minimal blunting of the left and right costophrenic sinus persists. On the previous radiograph, this blunting had no morphological correlate on the lateral chest x-ray. The lung volumes are low. Minimal atelectasis at both lung bases. No overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. The feeding tube and the right PICC line are normal in appearance.
