As compared to the previous radiograph, there is marked improvement of the predominantly bilateral perihilar and basal opacities, likely caused by pulmonary edema. The borders of the cardiac silhouette are better delineated. The small right Kerley B lines are almost completely resolved. The endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. The heart remains slightly enlarged and there is a mild-to-moderate degree of perihilar haze. No pleural effusions are seen. No new parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
