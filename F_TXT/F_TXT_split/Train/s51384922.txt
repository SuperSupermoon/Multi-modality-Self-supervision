AP chest compared to ___: The right apical pleural space is slightly smaller, now containing air and fluid. I can no longer tell whether the right upper lobe is still collapsed. The apical pleural tube is unchanged in position. Left lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Stomach is severely distended, though probably not as dilated as it was yesterday. Dr. ___ was paged at 2:15, one minute after recognition.
