Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, right subclavian central venous line is unchanged in position. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated but likely mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are prominent but stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is increased from the most recent prior study. There is indistinctness of the right hemidiaphragm with streaky opacification of the right lung base compatible with small pleural effusion and associated atelectasis. There is increased opacification at the left lung base with a meniscus suggesting increased small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis or consolidation.
