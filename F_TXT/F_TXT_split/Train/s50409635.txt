Predominantly interstitial abnormality most pronounced in the lower lobes has not improved anywhere and is slightly more extensive in the right lower lobe laterally, but previous pleural effusions are probably smaller. Heart size is normal. Differential diagnosis was discussed in my previous report. The persistence makes simple pulmonary edema less likely.
