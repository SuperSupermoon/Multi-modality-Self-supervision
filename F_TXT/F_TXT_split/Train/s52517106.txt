Since the prior film, a left chest tube has been inserted. The side port is possibly within the chest wall. There is reduction in the left pleural effusion with a moderate amount still remaining. The degree of rightward mediastinal shift is unchanged from the prior radiograph. There is a hint of radiolucency around the left mediastinal border suggesting some degree of pneumothorax as well. There are multiple rib fractures of the left posterior third through seventh ribs. The fifth and sixth rib fractures are floating. There is likely a small right effusion, but the right lung is clear and appears better aerated.
