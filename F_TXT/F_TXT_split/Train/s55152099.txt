There has been interval intubation with tip of endotracheal tube terminating approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. The cuff of the tube appears slightly overdistended, however. Heart size is normal. New, poorly defined opacities have developed at the left lung base and may relate to aspiration or atelectasis in the recent postoperative setting. Adjacent small left pleural effusion is present.
