A small left pleural effusion is seen, improved from prior study. There is an area of consolidation at the base of the right lung, worsened since the prior, which is likely related to pulmonary edema and effusion however supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours grossly unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
