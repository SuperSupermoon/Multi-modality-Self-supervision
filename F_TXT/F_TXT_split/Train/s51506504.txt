There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube. Lung volumes are grossly unchanged. Knee chest tube projects over the mediastinum. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. There is persistent widening of the mediastinum, unchanged compared to the prior study. Slight interval improvement in the right pleural effusion. Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. There are bilateral airspace opacities in the mid lungs which may reflect pulmonary edema versus infection. No pneumothorax seen.
