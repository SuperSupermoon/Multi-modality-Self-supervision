Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. NG tube tip is in the stomach. ET tube is in a standard position. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the main pulmonary artery. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Large bilateral pleural effusions and large bibasilar atelectases, greater on the left side, are unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Right PICC tip is at the cavoatrial junction. There is no evident pneumothorax.
