Tip of the tracheostomy tube abuts the left tracheal wall and should be evaluated clinically to see if the tube is appropriately positioned. Feeding tube passes beyond the distal stomach and out of view. There is no mediastinal widening or appreciable pneumo mediastinum. Consolidation at both lung bases has worsened since earlier in the day, presumably but not definitively due to worsening atelectasis, since pneumonia was suspected on earlier examinations. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
