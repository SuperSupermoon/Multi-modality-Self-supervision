Single portable view of the chest. Volume loss in the right hemithorax is seen with streaky right midlung and perihilar opacity with rightward shift of the mediastinum. These findings are presumably in part due to treatment for patient's known cancer however underlying mass is also possible. There is no prior to evaluate for interval change. The left lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax on either side. No acute osseous abnormality detected.
