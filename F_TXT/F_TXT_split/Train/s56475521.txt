As compared to the previous radiograph, a tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position. Also unchanged is a parenchymal opacity at the medial aspects of the right lower lung, adjacent but not obliterating the cardiac silhouette. The opacity is of unchanged size and extent. Air bronchograms continue to be seen. No new parenchymal opacities. No pulmonary edema. No pneumonia.
