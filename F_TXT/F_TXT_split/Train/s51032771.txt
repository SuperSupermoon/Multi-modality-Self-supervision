1. Two right-sided chest tubes remain in place with a tiny amount of loculated air at the right apex. A small amount of gas is also seen within the right lateral chest wall soft tissues. There is slight interval improvement in aeration at the right lung base where there still is residual patchy atelectasis. The left lung is grossly clear despite diminished lung volumes. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
