1. The endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 2.6 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. There continues to be bilateral diffuse airspace process with relative sparing of the right mid lung peripherally and stable persistent component of volume loss in the right upper lobe. These findings may reflect a combination of multifocal pneumonia and/or pulmonary edema. In addition, there is increasing consolidation in the retrocardiac region in the setting of bilateral layering effusions. This could also reflect superimposed lobar collapse. There are marked degenerative changes involving the right glenohumeral joint. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
