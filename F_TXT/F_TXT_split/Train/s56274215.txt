As compared to the previous radiograph, the parenchymal opacities have minimally increased in severity and extent. There also is blunting of the costophrenic sinuses, more evident on the left than on the right, probably caused by pleural effusions. The endotracheal tube projects with its tip 4 cm above the carina and is unchanged. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
