The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery with sternotomy. Several discontinuous and displaced sternal wires projecting over the upper mediastinum appear unchanged. The heart is again moderately enlarged. Pulmonary vessels and interstitium are prominent with indistinct vascularity, suggesting moderate vascular congestion, somewhat more prominent than on the more recent prior examination suggesting moderate pulmonary edema. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.
