The left subclavian line tip projects over the upper SVC. ET tube is approximately 4 cm from the carina. Left IJ catheter tip projects into the right IJ catheter tip. The distal right IJ is noted. Swan-Ganz catheter is noted with tip in appropriate position. Feeding tube is noted to pass below the level of the diaphragm with the tip not visualized in the field of view provided. Surgical drains are noted in the upper abdomen. Skin ___ are noted along the right paramedian abdomen. Surgical clips are noted along the left mediastinum. Bilateral low lung volumes are again noted with a juxtaphrenic peak noted at the right lung base. Mild vascular congestion appears stable to slightly improved from most recent prior examination. The portion of the left hemithorax is not included in the field of view. Left basilar atelectasis appears slightly improved on today's study. A small right-sided pleural effusion cannot be completely excluded. Minimal opacification at the right lung base appears consistent with atelectasis, less likely infection.
