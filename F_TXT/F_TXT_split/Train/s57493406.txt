Right pigtail pleural catheter has changed in orientation, but there remains no evidence of right pneumothorax. Small loculated right pleural fluid collection has slightly decreased in size, and adjacent right lung basilar opacity has improved as well. Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by interstitial edema. Moderate, loculated left pleural effusion appears slightly larger, with worsening adjacent atelectasis or consolidation in the left mid and lower lung region.
