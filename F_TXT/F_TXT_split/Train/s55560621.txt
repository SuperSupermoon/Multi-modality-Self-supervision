Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. An endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.7 cm above the level of carina. There is streaky right upper lobe opacity which may be due to partial collapse of the right upper lobe with possible underlying aspiration. If there has been trauma, underlying contusion is not excluded. There are overall low lung volumes. The left lung is clear. There is no large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The superior mediastinum is mildly prominent. If there is clinical concern for a chest injury, chest CTA would provide further evaluation.
