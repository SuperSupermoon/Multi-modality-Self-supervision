The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged, within the limitations of technique. There is again mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left. A right mid lung opacity has resolved since the prior study. There are, however, new streaky opacities in the right lower lobe with otherwise clear lungs. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
