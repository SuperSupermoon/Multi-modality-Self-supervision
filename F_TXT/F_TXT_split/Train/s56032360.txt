Patient is rotated slightly to the right for. The patient's chin overlies the superior medial right lung apex. Given this, the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in patient position, with the cardiac silhouette enlarged and prominence of the central pulmonary arteries. There is persistent hilar prominence. Hilar congestion is re- demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema. Battery pack with percutaneous pacer wires again overlies the left lower hemi thorax, partially obscuring the view. Given this, no large focal consolidation is seen. The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No displaced fracture identified.
