The patient is slightly rotated. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.2 cm above the carina. A left subclavian central venous catheter terminates at the lower SVC. An orogastric tube extends to the stomach. The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. A trace left pneumothorax is incidentally noted. Bilateral thoracostomy tubes are appropriately positioned.
