AP chest compared to ___: New right internal jugular line ends in the right atrium, at a level approximately 8 cm below the carina. To reposition it low in the SVC, it should be withdrawn 5 cm. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, increased since ___. Basal atelectasis is also likely. Mild cardiomegaly chronic. There is probably no pulmonary edema, but the lower lungs are substantially obscured by soft tissue and pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Subsequent chest radiograph, 8:41 p.m., showed repositioning of the right internal jugular line low in the SVC.
