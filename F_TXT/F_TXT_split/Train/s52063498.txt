AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, ___: Severe cardiomegaly and mild upper lobe vascular redistribution persists but there is no pulmonary edema, and no lung findings worrisome for appreciable pneumonia. There is some mild peribronchial opacification in the right lower lung, which could as easily be due to mild atelectasis or aspiration. To be safe I would repeat a chest radiograph in 12 hours if there is still any clinical concern for pneumonia. The upper enteric feeding tube loops in the stomach and ends in the fundus.
