An ET tube is present. The carina is not well delineated, but the tube lies at the upper edge of the clavicular heads approximately 7.3 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm. If there is a side port, it is poorly visualized. A right IJ central line is present, tip over mid SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Compared with the ___ film, there are new dense alveolar infiltrates diffusely through both lungs, with relative sparing of the periphery. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent pulmonary edema, but the differential diagnosis is extensive and includes inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic etiologies, hemorrhage and ARDS.
