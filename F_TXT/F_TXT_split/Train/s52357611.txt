There is no significant change and decreased volume and left basal opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse. Bilateral small pleural effusions are unchanged with subsegmental right basilar atelectasis. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are notable for enlargement of the aortic knob contour, consistent with known dissection. Retrocardiac opacity likely reflect a combination of atelectasis and known large hiatal hernia.
