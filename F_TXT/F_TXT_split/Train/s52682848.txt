AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___. During the interval previously existing Swan-Ganz catheter and sheath have been removed and a new right internal jugular approach central venous line has been placed, the tip of which is overlying the right-sided superior mediastinum. The termination occurs 2 cm above the level of the carina and thus indicates position in the superior third of the SVC. No pneumothorax has developed. Previously described status post aortic valve replacement and right-sided chest tube advanced from below is unchanged. No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen and the pulmonary vascular congestive pattern has not increased.
