In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. The morning the cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits. There is mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Areas of increased opacification in the left parahilar and infrahilar region again are worrisome for recurrent aspiration. Hazy opacification at the left base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with layering effusion and underlying atelectatic changes. There is probably also a small right effusion.
