THE DRAIN PREVIOUSLY SEEN AT THE BASE OF THE LEFT LUNG IS NOT DEFINITIVELY IDENTIFIED. POSSIBLE SMALL RIGHT APICAL PNEUMOTHORAX. SMALL RIGHT EFFUSION AND HAZY OPACITY ALONG THE LOWER RIGHT CHEST IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED. THE PREVIOUSLY SEEN ELLIPSOID DENSITY IN THE RIGHT MIDZONE IS NO LONGER VISUALIZED. MINIMAL PLATELIKE ATELECTASIS OR TRACE FLUID IN THE MINOR FISSURE IS NOW NOTED. OTHERWISE, I DOUBT SIGNIFICANT INTERVAL CHANGE.
