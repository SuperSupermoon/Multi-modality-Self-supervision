Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm. The pulmonary arteries remain prominent and may reflect underlying pulmonary artery hypertension. Several calcified masses in the left lower lobe better seen on the CT from ___ are not well visualized. There continues to be more focal consolidation at the left base likely with an associated effusion. Overall, however, the left lower lobe process appears to be worsening suggesting that there likely is a superimposed infectious process. Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Multiple calcified nodes are again seen in the neck. Hardware is seen overlying the mid to lower cervical spine.
