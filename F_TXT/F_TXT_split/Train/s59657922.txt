Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Dual-lead left-sided ICD is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, possibly slightly increased as compared to the prior study. There has been interval decrease in moderate pulmonary edema which is now minimal. Subtle right base opacity is seen, which may be due to overlying soft tissue and technique versus asymmetric pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
