As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient shows increased vascular markings throughout the entire lungs, most noticeable in the right upper lung. Given the low lung volumes and a moderate cardiomegaly, these findings are suggestive of increasing fluid overload. Retrocardiac atelectasis, the presence of small pleural effusions cannot be excluded. In the interval, the patient has also been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.8 cm above the carina. No complications, notably no pneumothorax.
