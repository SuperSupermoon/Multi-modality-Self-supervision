Cardiac size remains unchanged. There has been complete reaeration of the right upper lobe. A dense streak is again seen along the normal position of the minor fissure. There are lower lung volumes. Increased opacification at the left lung base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe. There is no pneumothorax. The monitoring and support devices remain in place.
