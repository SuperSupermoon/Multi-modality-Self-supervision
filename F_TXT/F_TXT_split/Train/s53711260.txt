Endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating approximately 3 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach, with tip off the inferior borders of the film. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is top normal, accentuated by the low inspiratory lung volumes. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Bronchovascular crowding is demonstrated without pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases which may reflect areas of atelectasis though aspiration cannot be excluded. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
