A three-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable. There is again a moderate-to-large left-sided pleural effusion with presumed parenchymal opacification, probably attributable to atelectasis. There is also a suspected small right-sided pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Compared to earlier radiographs of the same day, hazy opacification and vascular prominence seem similar to mildly decreased.
