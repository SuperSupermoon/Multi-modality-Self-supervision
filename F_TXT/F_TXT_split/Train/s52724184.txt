Compared with the prior study, inspiratory volumes are lower. Allowing for this, again seen is a small right effusion, with collapse and/or consolidation at the left base. The degree of right base atelectasis is more pronounced. Also again seen is increased retrocardiac density, also more pronounced. There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. No left-sided effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly similar. Opacity overlying the right lung apex medially appears to relate to a mask or other device outside the the patient -- clinical correlation is requested to confirm this. No pneumothorax identified.
