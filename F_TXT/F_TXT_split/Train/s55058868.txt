Since the prior exam, there is a new endotracheal tube with the tip at the level of the clavicles, approximately 6 cm from the carina. Otherwise, there is no significant change, including stable widespread bilateral parenchymal opacities, probable small pleural effusions, and cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax.
