Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is unfolded. Previously demonstrated small hiatal hernia on CT is not seen on this single frontal view. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Minimal patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Degenerative changes are noted involving the thoracic spine and both acromioclavicular joints.
