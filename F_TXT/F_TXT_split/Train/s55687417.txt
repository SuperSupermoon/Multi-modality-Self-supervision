Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There are low lung volumes. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is accentuated by the low lung volumes. There is crowding of the bronchial vasculature and bibasilar atelectasis larger on the left side. Engorgement of the vessels could be due to projection and low lung volumes but fluid overload can also be present. There is no pneumothorax. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. The stomach is distended.
