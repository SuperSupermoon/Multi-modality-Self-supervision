Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ ___, 08:10. Patient's upper extremities obscure large areas of both sides of the chest. I can see that the right apical pleural drain is still in place, but it looks like the large right pleural effusion is larger. I can't say whether there is any right pleural air collection. Most of the right lower lung is probably still airless. On the left, there is no pneumothorax, probably a small pleural effusion, and worsening atelectasis or pneumonia in the left lower lobe. Severe gaseous distention distension of the colon is long-standing.
