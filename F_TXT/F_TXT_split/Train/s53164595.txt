As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has been removed. The pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities are minimally less widespread and dens but overall not substantially changed in severity. The lung volumes remain constant. There is opacification of the left costophrenic sinus, likely caused by a small left pleural effusion. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant.
