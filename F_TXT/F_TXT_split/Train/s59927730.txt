Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to atelectasis or a trace left pleural effusion. Streaky basilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis, less likely aspiration. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
