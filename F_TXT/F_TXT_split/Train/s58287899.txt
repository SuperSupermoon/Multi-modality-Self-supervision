Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal contour is unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob. Moderate to severe pulmonary edema appears minimally worse compared to the previous study with continued small bilateral pleural effusions. More focal opacities at the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
