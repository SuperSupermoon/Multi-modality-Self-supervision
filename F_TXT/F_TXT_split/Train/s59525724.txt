CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Rotated positioning. An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 4.1 cm above the carina. A right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is present, tip overlying right pulmonary artery. A right IJ sheath is present, tip over right IJ immediately above the confluence with the subclavian. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A left IJ catheter is present, tip over distal SVC. Surgical drains are noted on both sides of the upper abdomen. There is diffuse bilateral opacity in both lungs. This appears to represent a combination of relatively large bilateral layering effusions and underlying opacities, likely alveolar opacities. Findings are compatible with pulmonary edema, although other alveolar processes could account for this appearance. No free air is detected beneath the diaphragm and no pneumothorax is detected.
