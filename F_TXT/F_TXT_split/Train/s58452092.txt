There has been interval repositioning of the left chest tube. The previously seen moderate left pneumothorax has nearly resolved in the interval, with only a small trace pneumothorax seen laterally. Large cavitary left lower lobe lesion as well as complex left upper lobe cavitary parenchymal disease with adjacent pleural thickening have been more fully assessed by a recent CT. There is no pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
