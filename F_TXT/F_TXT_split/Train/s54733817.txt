As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Known extensive parenchymal lung damage bilaterally, with predominance in the right upper lobe, the right lower lobe and the retrocardiac lung areas. The tracheostomy tube is in constant position. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No new parenchymal changes. The presence of a small left pleural effusion is still likely.
