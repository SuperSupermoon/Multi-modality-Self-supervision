There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous line, with the tip ending in the upper superior vena cava. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is mild persistent bibasilar atelectasis, which is more notable on the left. The left costophrenic angle is only partially included on this study. There is mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle, suggesting a small pleural effusion.
