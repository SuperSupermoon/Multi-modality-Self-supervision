Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. A new endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina. NG tube terminates below the diaphragm. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Pulmonary edema has improved since the prior exam. Residual left base opacity may represent resolving edema or potentially infection. No pneumothorax.
