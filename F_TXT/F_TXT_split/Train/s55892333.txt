Low bilateral lung volumes with bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis, not significantly changed from prior. A left PICC line base present, the tip projecting expected location of the superior cavoatrial junction. The cardiac silhouette is obscured by the bilateral pleural effusions and low lung volumes. No pneumothorax.
