Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 7 cm above the level of the carina, top normal. Right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter is stable. Extensive bilateral opacities appear minimally increased compared to the prior study. However, lung volumes are also lower which likely accentuate this. Bilateral pleural effusions also appear increased.
