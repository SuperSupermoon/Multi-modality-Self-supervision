In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been removal of a large right pleural effusion. There is a thick possible pleural line in the right apical region that could represent a tiny pneumothorax. The right central catheter has been removed and there is some residual mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Tracheostomy and left IJ catheter remain in place.
