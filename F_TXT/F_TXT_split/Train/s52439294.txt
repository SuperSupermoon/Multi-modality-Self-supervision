Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits. There are low lung volumes. This causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax, with mild atelectatic changes noted at the lung bases. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen. No definite free air is seen under the diaphragms.
