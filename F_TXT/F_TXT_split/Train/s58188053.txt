Size of the patient's left apical pneumothorax is unchanged very slightly slightly smaller compared to yesterday's study. Taking into account differences in obliquity, there is no significant interval change in the appearance of the lungs or the heart and mediastinal contours. No central pulmonary vascular congestion is seen. Healed posttraumatic changes at the proximal humerus and acromioclavicular joint appear stable.
