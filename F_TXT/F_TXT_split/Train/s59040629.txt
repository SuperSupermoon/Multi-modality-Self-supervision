AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding AP and lateral chest examination of ___. There is now an almost complete whiteout of the right hemithorax indicative of increased pleural effusion in comparison with the preceding study. Possibility that fluid has shifted related to differences in patient position must be considered as the amount of pleural effusion was already deemed to be very large on the preceding study. A Dobbhoff line is now seen and reaches well below the diaphragm with the distal portion of the line well located in the fundus of the stomach. No new pulmonary abnormalities in the left hemithorax as seen on this single view chest examination.
