Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no pneumothorax. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to overlying soft tissue although trace pleural effusion is not excluded. Anchor screws are seen overlying the right humeral head.
