Single portable chest radiograph. The lungs are well expanded. Reticular opacities predominantly involve the right base. There is no consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is moderate. The trachea is deviated leftward by the thyroid and rightward by the calcified aortic arch. A one cm. nodule in the right apex; to determine whether it is calcified, and part of a region of scarring, would require CT scanning.
