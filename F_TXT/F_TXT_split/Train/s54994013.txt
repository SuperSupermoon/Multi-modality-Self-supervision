AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding portable study obtained 12 hours earlier during the same day. The patient remains intubated. The ET tube in unchanged position terminating the trachea. The same holds for the left-sided internal jugular approach central venous line seen to terminate overlying the mid SVC at a right-sided PICC line terminating in similar location. No pneumothorax has developed in the apical area. Previously described and observed bilateral small caliber pigtail ending chest tubes remain in place. Pleural densities partially obscuring the diaphragmatic contours as before. No new pulmonary abnormalities can be seen.
