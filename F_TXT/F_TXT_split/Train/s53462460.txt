As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased, likely reflecting a lesser inspiratory effort. Minimal areas of atelectasis at both lung bases. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pulmonary edema, no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. No evidence of local hyperemia.
