There are low lung volumes. Patchy bilateral opacities including in the left upper to mid and lower lung and in the right mid to lower lung raise concern for multifocal pneumonia. There may also be underlying aspiration. No large pleural effusion is seen although trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unremarkable.
