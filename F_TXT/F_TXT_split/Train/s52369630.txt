1. An intra-aortic balloon pump is in place with its tip approximately 4.5 cm below the top of the aortic arch. A femoral Swan-Ganz catheter is in place with the tip in the pulmonary outflow tract. There are persistent areas of consolidation in the right lower lobe and in the left lower lobe which appear to be slightly less consolidative when compared to the prior study of ___. These findings, however, likely represent pneumonia. There is also retrocardiac consolidation that could reflect an area of pneumonia or partial lower lobe atelectasis. The stomach is distended with a prominent amount of gas. No pulmonary edema. Right internal jugular introducer catheter with the tip in the proximal SVC. There is an apparent curvilinear line traversing the right fourth interspace. This is felt to most likely represent a skin fold rather than a pleural line related to a pneumothorax. This area can be better assessed on followup imaging. A triangular opacity along the medial right upper lobe is also felt to likely represent an artifact from something external to the patient. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
