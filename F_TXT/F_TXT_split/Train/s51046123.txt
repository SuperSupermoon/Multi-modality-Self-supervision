The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged allowing for differences in technique aside from decreased heart size. Mitral annular calcifications are prominent. The main pulmonary artery contour is again mildly prominent. The aortic arch is calcified. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Streaky opacities in the left mid lung probably in the lingula and medial right lower lung, probably in the right lower lobe are suggestive of minor atelectasis, although particularly with regard to the latter, an early developing pneumonia is difficult to exclude.
