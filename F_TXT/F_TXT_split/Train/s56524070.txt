A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Left mid to lower lung parenchymal opacities are slightly increased, consistent with progression of the known left lower lobe pneumonia. Increased opacity at the left base is could be due to increased effusion versus worsening consolidation. Effusion is more likely, given rightward shift of the mediastinum. The right lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax.
