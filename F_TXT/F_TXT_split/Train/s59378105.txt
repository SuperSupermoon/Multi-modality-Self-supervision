There has been significant interval development of a large right-sided pleural effusion layering along the right lateral pleural surface. There also appears to be increased opacification of the right lung which may be secondary to layering fluid. In the context of the increased opacification of the right lung, a new focal consolidation cannot be excluded. The left lung also demonstrates increased peripheral opacities which may be secondary to atelectasis given their development in the last three days, however an infectious etiology cannot be ruled out. The left lung volume is low. The heart size is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
