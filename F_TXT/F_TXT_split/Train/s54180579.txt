Support and monitoring devices are similar in position. Persistent cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion as well as a moderate-to-large left pleural effusion. The latter is similar in appearance to prior study when allowances are made for positional differences between the exams. However, there has been apparent interval decrease in right pleural effusion since the prior radiograph. Otherwise, no short interval relevant changes.
