The patient remains intubated. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach. A patchy right mid-to-lower lung opacity has partly resolved. Left basilar opacities have mostly resolved. This change confirms the likelihood that these opacities were due to atelectatic changes. A round mass-like opacity again projects over the medial right lung apex. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.
