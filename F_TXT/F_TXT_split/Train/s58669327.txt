Compared to prior chest radiographs Small left apical pneumothorax unchanged. Moderately extensive subcutaneous emphysema left chest wall may have improved. No appreciable left pleural effusion. Apparent heterogeneous opacification in the left lower lobe could be due in part to overlying soft tissue but raises concern for early pneumonia. Careful followup advised. Right lung hyperinflated due to emphysema, clear of any focal abnormality. Heart size normal. Displaced left rib fractures noted, unchanged.
