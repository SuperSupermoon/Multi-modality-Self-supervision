A nasogastric tube has been placed and courses below the diaphragm with the tip and side port projecting over the stomach. Overall, airspace opacities in the lungs have improved suggestive of resolving edema and there are residual streaky linear opacities bilaterally. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient rotation between studies. No pneumothorax. No large effusions.
