Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates patient rotated to the right. There is a right pectoral pacemaker AICD with at least three leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle, and what appears to be coronary sinus. The cardiac silhouette is prominent, but unchanged. There is mild unfolding of the descending aorta. Atherosclerotic calcification is seen in the aortic arch. There is new perihilar interstitial edema. More confluent opacity at the right base could be a combination of edema, atelectasis, and a small effusion, or, alternatively pneumonia.
