Endotracheal tube tip ends in the right mainstem bronchus and should be pulled back approximately 3.5 cm. A right port ends in the low SVC. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Lung volumes are low. There is increased opacification of the left lung, which may reflect collapse secondary to right mainstem bronchus intubation or asymmetric edema.
