Surgical clips project over the right axilla. Increased retrocardiac opacity, likely reflecting pleural fluid and increasing consolidation. No pneumothorax or right pleural effusion identified. The size the cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but unchanged. Calcification of the aortic arch is noted. It is noted that the calcification is remote from the wall of the aortic arch, compatible with known aortic dissection.
