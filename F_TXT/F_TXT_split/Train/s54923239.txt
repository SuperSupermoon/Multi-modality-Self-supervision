The lungs remain clear, without new focal opacity to suggest pneumonia. Scarring is again noted at the left lung base. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Intact median sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are again noted. Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There is calcification and tortuosity of the descending aorta. There is no free air identified under the hemidiaphragms.
