The new ET tube ends 4.5 cm from the carina. The right IJ central venous catheter is in unchanged position with the tip in the low SVC. The enteric tube tip passes below the diaphragm, however the side port is within a moderate hiatal hernia. This should be advanced 8.3 cm for optimal positioning. Allowing for changes in positioning, there is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. There may be a small left pleural effusion. There is stable mild cardiomegaly. Note is made of total right shoulder arthroplasty and anterior and posterior cervical fusion devices. There are moderate degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint.
