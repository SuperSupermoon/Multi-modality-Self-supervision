AP chest compared to 6:45 p.m.: Post-operative widening of the mediastinum is stable in the region of the arch, but there may be an increased caliber to the mediastinum along the right heart border and ascending thoracic aorta, findings suggesting hemopericardium, reflected in leftward displacement of the right transjugular Swan-Ganz catheter. A relatively small left apical pleural or extrapleural hematoma which increased earlier after surgery is stable. There is no appreciable layering left pleural effusion. Lung volumes are well maintained. Atelectasis moderately severe in the left lower lobe, mild elsewhere. ET tube in standard placement. A Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary artery. Course of the esophagus denoted by the drainage tube is expected. No definite pneumothorax.
