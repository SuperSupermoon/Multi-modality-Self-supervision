Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the right atrium. There is rightward shift of mediastinal structures due to the presence of a large left pleural effusion, which is significantly increased in size compared to the previous CT. Left basilar opacification is likely due to compressive atelectasis. Heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of the large pleural effusion. Numerous nodular opacities within the right lung base are compatible with known metastatic disease. Hyperinflation of the lungs with attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices is compatible with underlying emphysema. No pneumothorax is present. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a trace right pleural effusion.
