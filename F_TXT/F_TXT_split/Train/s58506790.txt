Compared with the prior study and allowing for differences positioning, again seen is the small right pleural effusion. As before, the lung contour along the right lateral mid/lower chest wall appears irregular and the presence of a loculated pneumothorax/hydro pneumothorax remains a possibility. Compared with the film from 1 day earlier, there is more pronounced patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region. While this could represent atelectasis, it is relatively rounded and raises the possibility of a focus of aspiration or early pneumonic infiltrate. Again seen is minimal atelectasis at the left base. Minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle slightly more pronounced than on the prior study. Doubt overt CHF. A rounded 9.7 mm density projects over the left proximal humerus. In the absence of known malignancy, this likely represents a bone island.
