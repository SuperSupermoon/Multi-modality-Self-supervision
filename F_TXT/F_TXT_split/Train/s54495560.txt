Single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right-sided subclavian venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction. Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles. Enteric catheter courses below the left hemidiaphragm terminating in the body of stomach. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Left lung base opacification is poorly assessed given patient positioning, but may reflect combination of atelectasis and effusion. Underlying infectious process cannot be excluded.
