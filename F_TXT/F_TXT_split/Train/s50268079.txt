1. There is consolidative opacification in the right upper lobe and in the left lower lobe, which would be concerning for pneumonia or aspiration. In addition, there is likely airspace opacity within the right middle lobe as the right heart border is obscured. Findings are felt to less likely represent pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation, however, is advised. Radiopaque areas within the paratracheal soft tissues may represent calcified lymph nodes, although correlation with prior imaging would be helpful to better characterize this finding. The heart is upper limits of normal in size given portable technique. No pneumothorax is seen. Possible layering effusions, left greater than right.
