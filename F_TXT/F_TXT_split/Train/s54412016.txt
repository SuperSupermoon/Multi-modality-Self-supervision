As compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall has substantially worsened. It partially obscures a small right pneumothorax, which is probably unchanged allowing for this factor. Exam is otherwise remarkable for worsening atelectasis in the right mid and lower lung and a probable small right pleural effusion. No other relevant changes since recent study.
