An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position 2.3 cm above the carina. The right IJ central line is present -- the tip is obscured by overlying structures, but likely lies over the mid SVC, unchanged. Heart size at the upper limits of normal. There is upper zone redistribution, but I doubt overt CHF. No focal infiltrate or effusion is identified. No pneumothorax detected. Compared with 1 day earlier, I doubt significant interval change.
