Since the prior radiograph performed approximately one day earlier, the opacity at the right medial base has increased in density. Additionally, a new opacity at the left base is present. These are likely atelectasis given the low lung volumes, although aspiration or pneumonia are considerations. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The widened mediastinum is unchanged from the prior exam. The cardiac silhouette is normal. An endotracheal tube is 4.7 cm from the carina. An NG tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. This is new from the prior exam.
