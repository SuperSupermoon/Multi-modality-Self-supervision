Lordotic positioning. A right-sided internal jugular catheter is seen, terminating in the mid SVC. Left-sided pacemaker is identified. Probable background hyperinflation. The cardiac silhouette is probably slightly enlarged. The pulmonary vasculature is somewhat centrally congested. Hazy bilateral opacities are noted. Lung bases are not entirely imaged. Allowing for this, no frank consolidation is detected. No gross effusions are seen. No obvious pneumothorax is identified.
