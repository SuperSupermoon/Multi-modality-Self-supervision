Unchanged small bi-apical pneumothoraces, and persistent abnormal course of left PICC with configuration suggesting entry into the azygos vein (please see documented communication and preliminary report above). Overall, little change in the appearance of the chest since the recent study of a few hours earlier except for slight improved aeration in the left retrocardiac area.
