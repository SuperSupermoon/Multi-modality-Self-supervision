The nasogastric tube is coiled within the hiatal hernia. Although the distal tip does pass below the diaphragm sagittal appears to be just past the diaphragmatic hiatus and thus the NG tube should be advanced for more optimal positioning. The lung volumes are low. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely technical.
