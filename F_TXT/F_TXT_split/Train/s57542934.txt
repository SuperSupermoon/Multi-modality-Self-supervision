Subclavian catheter ends at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged since prior examination. There is increased opacification of the right lung, mainly for increased pleural effusion. The right atelectasis seems overall unchanged, the left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion are unchanged. Heart size is presumably enlarged partially obscured by right lower lobe pathology. Pulmonary edema is improved, especially on the right lung. There is no pneumothorax.
