Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate moderate pulmonary edema, which has worsened since prior imaging. There is increased opacity in the right lung base, consistent with a moderate right pleural effusion. There is a small left basilar opacity again seen, consistent with a small left pleural effusion and atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly is again seen, stable.
