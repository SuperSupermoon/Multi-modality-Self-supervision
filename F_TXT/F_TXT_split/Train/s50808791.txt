The patient is status post esophagectomy and pull-up procedure. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in the postoperative period. Worsening homogeneous opacity in the right lower hemithorax bordered superiorly by the minor fissure. This probably reflects a combination of moderate pleural effusion and postoperative atelectasis, but coexisting infectious pneumonia is possible in the appropriate clinical setting. No change in left retrocardiac atelectasis and small left effusion.
