There has been interval removal of a right internal jugular central venous line. Median sternotomy wires appear intact. Mediastinal clips are again noted. A previously described tiny left apical pneumothorax is not evident on the current examination. There are stable small bilateral pleural effusions. Overall, aeration of the left lung base appears improved suggesting decreasing atelectasis. Increased opacity in the left upper lobe is likely due to atelectasis. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, though no overt interstitial edema. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged from prior.
