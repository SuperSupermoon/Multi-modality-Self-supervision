The ET tube is 2.6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach. There continues to be pulmonary vascular re-distribution and some patchy areas of alveolar infiltrate most marked in the right lower lobe. Kerley B lines are present. The overall impression is that of CHF which is slightly increased in the interval. An underlying infectious infiltrate in the right lower lobe cannot be excluded.
