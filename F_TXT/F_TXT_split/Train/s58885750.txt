As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities, right more than left, with unchanged evidence of a moderate right pleural effusion. The lung volumes have minimally increased, potentially reflecting an increase in ventilatory pressure. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
