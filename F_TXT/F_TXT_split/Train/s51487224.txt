Left chest tube remains in place, with a very small left apical pneumothorax, which is similar compared to the previous radiograph. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Slight improvement in patchy and linear bibasilar areas of atelectasis. Apparent decrease in extent of free intraperitoneal air in this patient status post recent abdominal surgery.
