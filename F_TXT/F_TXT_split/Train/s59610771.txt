Mildy increased density in the right hemithorax could be attributed due to the rotation of the patient and scoliotic deformity; however, possibility of layered pleural effusion cannot be ruled out. The left lung is clear. Left chest tube is seen with tip terminating near the left apical region. Prominence of the mediastinal contour on right side is likely due to a prominent aortic arch, which is of unknown chronicity. The heart size and hilar contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax.
