Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates tip of the ET tube extending to 3.6 cm above the carina, satisfactory. A previously noted small pneumothorax on initial presentation CT dated ___ is no longer appreciated. A left transthoracic chest tube has similar configuration as compared to prior exam. An enteric tube traverses inferiorly below diaphragm with tip in the stomach. Midline abdominal surgical ___ are in place. The heart is top normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits allowing for AP technique. Dense retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis. Upper lungs are well aerated. There is no large pleural effusion. Multilevel nondisplaced or minimally displaced left posterolateral ribs are better delineated on prior CT from two days ago, in keeping with history of trauma.
