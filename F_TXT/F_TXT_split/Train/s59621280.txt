Portable AP view of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube which terminates 2 cm above the carina, and can be withdrawn at least 1.5 cm. There is consolidation within the left midlung, likely representing pneumonia and/or aspiration, as well as hazy opacification in the right perihilar region and right lung base, also suspicious for pneumonia and/or aspiration. There is blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally, likely due to small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. An esophageal tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm. The heart size is mildly enlarged. There is partially visualized surgical hardware within the cervical spine. Residual contrast is seen in the bilateral renal collecting systems from prior CT.
