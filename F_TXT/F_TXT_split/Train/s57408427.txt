Lungs are clear without confluent consolidation. There is no overt interstitial edema or large pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are exaggerated due to the AP technique, though mild cardiomegaly is likely and appears unchanged. Numerous mediastinal surgical clips are noted. Median sternotomy wires appear intact. There is no pneumothorax.
