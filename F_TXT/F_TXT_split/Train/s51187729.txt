There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating in the proximal to mid SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. The patient is status post median sternotomy. Dual lead right-sided pacemaker is again seen, unchanged in position. Curvilinear radiopaque structures project over the bilateral proximal humeri, not seen on the prior study and most likely external to the patient. Otherwise, there has been no significant interval change.
