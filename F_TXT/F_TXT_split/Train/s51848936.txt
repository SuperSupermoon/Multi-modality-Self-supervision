Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm with tip off the inferior borders of the film. Near total opacification of the left hemithorax is new and concerning for left lung atelectasis/collapse. The heart size is difficult to assess given the near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax, though minimal visualization of the right heart border suggests that there may be minimal leftward shift of mediastinal structures. Patchy opacities in the right lung base reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pneumothorax is demonstrated. The extreme right lateral chest is excluded from the field of view. Previously seen right anterior rib fractures are not evident on the current exam. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is incompletely assessed.
