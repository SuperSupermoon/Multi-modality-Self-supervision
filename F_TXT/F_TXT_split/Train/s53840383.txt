Rotated positioning. Given the degree of rotated positioning, the conventional ET tube/carina relationship is not demonstrated. Allowing for this, the tip of the ET tube appears to lie 7.8 cm above the carina and 1.8 cm above the superior edge of the medial clavicular heads, relatively high. A Swan-Ganz catheter is present -- the tip overlies the cardiac silhouette, possibly related to the RV outflow tract, but difficult to confirm due to rotation. A left IJ central line is present, tip likely overlying the proximal/mid SVC, unchanged. A left subclavian PICC line appears to be present. However, the tip lies immediately inside the lateral left thoracic cage and does not extend to the central venous vasculature. Increased retrocardiac density is unchanged. Atelectasis at the right base is also unchanged. No pneumothorax detected.
