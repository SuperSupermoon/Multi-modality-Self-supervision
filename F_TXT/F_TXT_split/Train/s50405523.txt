A tracheostomy tube is in place. There is hyperinflation consistent with background COPD. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, including mild cardiomegaly and prominence of the superior mediastinum, is unchanged compared with ___. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, without other evidence of CHF. There are patchy opacities at both lung bases. Possible minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, but no gross effusion identified. Again seen is calcification along the left chest wall, possibly sequela from old hemothorax. Multiple clips again noted in the upper abdomen.
