Compared with film from one day earlier and allowing for technical differences, I doubt significant interval change. There are low inspiratory volumes with an elevated left hemidiaphragm. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but unchanged. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and mild diffuse vascular blurring. Possible slight interval improvement in patchy opacity at right lung base.
