Current exam is highly limited due to slight motion degradation as well as down cast chin obscuring the right upper lung. Allowing for such, right pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis in the right lung appears similar to slightly decreased as compared to one day prior. There is suggestion of pulmonary vascular engorgement without frank edema. Left basilar atelectasis is redemonstrated, possibly with a tiny effusion. There is no pneumothorax in the left lung. The right upper lung is obscured. Postoperative mediastinal widening is unchanged. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly prominent.
