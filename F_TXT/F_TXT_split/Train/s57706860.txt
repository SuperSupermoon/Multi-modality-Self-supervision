There is a small right apical pneumothorax with no evidence of tension. Compared to the prior radiograph, the endotracheal and orogastric tubes have been removed. The lung volumes are low. There is left basilar volume loss due to a small pleural effusion and probable associated atelectasis which may have been present on the prior study, but is now layering due to upright patient position. The sternal cerclage wires are intact. The Swan-Ganz catheter is unchanged. Post-surgical cardiac and mediastinal widening is unchanged.
