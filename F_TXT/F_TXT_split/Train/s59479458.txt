In comparison with the study of ___, there is an placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The side port of the nasogastric tube appears to be just distal to the esophagogastric junction. Some atelectatic changes are seen at the bases, especially on the right. If there is serious clinical concern for aspiration, this would have to be considered at the right base.
