CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. A tracheostomy tube is in place, the tip lies approximately 16 mm above the carina. This appears to represent a change in the tracheostomy tube compared with earlier the same day (___ at 9:59 a.m.). The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent but unchanged. Some patchy opacity in the left greater than right suprahilar regions is unchanged. Some bibasilar atelectasis is also unchanged. Prominent pulmonary artery is again noted in this individual with history of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
