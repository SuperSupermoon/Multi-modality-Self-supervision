In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is continued opacification at the bases, more prominent on the right, consistent with some combination of pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis. On the right, possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be seriously considered and a lateral view would be helpful if clinically possible. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size. Some poor definition of pulmonary vessels could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Ribcage deformity is again seen on the left. Right subclavian catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
