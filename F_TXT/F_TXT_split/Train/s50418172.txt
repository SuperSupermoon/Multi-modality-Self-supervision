AP chest compared to ___: Moderate right pleural effusion persists but small left pleural effusion has continued to diminish revealing only mildly engorged vasculature in the left lung. On the right there is probably still residual edema. Heart is normal size and mediastinal veins are not dilated, an indication that right heart failure or intravascular volume are normal. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube passes at least as far as the mid stomach. Rapid improvement in aeration in the right upper lobe between ___ suggest that a lot of this is due to atelectasis, but residual consolidation projects over the upper pole of the right hilus confirmed on the CT scan of ___.
