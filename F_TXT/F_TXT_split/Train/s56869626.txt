The nasogastric tube now courses below the diaphragm with both the side port and tip projecting over the stomach. Right basilar opacity is unchanged and may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is recommended. The lung apices are not entirely included. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning.
