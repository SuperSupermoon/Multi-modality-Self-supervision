Semi-upright portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. An NG tube is seen coiled in the left upper quadrant. The endotracheal tube tip is located 4.7 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are low with scattered subsegmental atelectasis in the left upper and lower lobes. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinal contour appears somewhat prominent, likely technique related. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
