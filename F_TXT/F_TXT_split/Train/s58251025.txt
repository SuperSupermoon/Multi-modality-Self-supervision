Comparison is made to the prior study performed a day earlier. NG tube tip is coiled in the proximal duodenum. There are low lung volumes with increasing left lower lobe opacities, consistent with increasing atelectasis. Cardiomegaly is stable. The aorta is tortuous. There is no pneumothorax or large effusions.
