Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. There are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Given this, the perihilar vasculature appears prominent which may be due to mild edema or may relate to the low lung volumes. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.
