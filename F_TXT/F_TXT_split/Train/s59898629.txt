Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Previously seen embolic material scattered throughout both lungs is significantly less evident on the current study as compared to prior, with possible small residua in the right lower lobe. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable and unremarkable. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
