Since the prior exam, the endotracheal tube and enteric tube have been removed. A left PICC is unchanged with the tip at the origin of the SVC. Allowing for changes in lung volumes, mild vascular congestion and retrocardiac atelectasis is not significantly changed. There is likely a small left pleural effusion. There is no new opacity, right pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Marked enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
