1. Slight interval improvement in aeration with increasing lung volumes, although persistent patchy opacities at both bases with associated layering effusions are seen most suggestive of compressive atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
