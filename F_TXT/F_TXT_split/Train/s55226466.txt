As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. There is a new left pleural effusion with left basal atelectasis. In addition, on the right, there is a parenchymal opacity, likely atelectatic in origin, but the presence of pneumonia caused by aspiration cannot be excluded. Short-term followup with chest radiography is required. Unchanged tracheostomy tube position. Unchanged known right humeral fracture.
