The endotracheal tube has been slightly advanced. The tip of the tube now projects 3.5 cm above the carina. The patient is now after bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy and potential lavage is likely to explain new relatively widespread alveolar opacities in the right lung. Otherwise, there is no relevant change. Moderate cardiomegaly and left-sided opacities and consolidations are constant. No pneumothorax. A new nasogastric tube has been inserted, the tip is not included on the image, the course of the catheter is unremarkable.
