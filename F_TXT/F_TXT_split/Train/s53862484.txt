1. Overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours in this patient status post median sternotomy for CABG. Interval improvement in pulmonary edema since the previous study, although there is still residual mild edema on the current examination. There is a large hiatal hernia. Calcified diaphragmatic pleural plaques are again seen consistent with prior asbestos exposure. Interval removal of the right PICC line. Probable small left effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax.
