1. Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet. The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC, unchanged. There has been interval placement of a left basilar chest tube with improvement in aeration of the left lung and some loculated air along the lateral and medial basilar aspects of the lower lobe likely representing loculated pneumothorax. Small right pleural effusion remains. There is increasing indistinctness of the pulmonary vascularity which likely represents an element of superimposed mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
