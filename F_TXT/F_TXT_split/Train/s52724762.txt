Continued low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. There is some increased opacification in the perihilar region on the left. It is unclear whether this could reflect gravitational edema or possibly aspiration. The hemidiaphragms are not well seen, raising the possibility of pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis at the bases.
