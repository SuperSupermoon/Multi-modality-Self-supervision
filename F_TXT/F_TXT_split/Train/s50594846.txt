Double tube passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. Left pigtail catheter and right pigtail catheter are in place. Right PICC line terminates in the right atrium and should be pulled back at least 4.5 cm. Since the prior study the insertion of the left pigtail has Coast substantial decrease in left pleural effusion. Right pigtail catheter is in unchanged position. There is potentially minimal right apical pneumothorax. No substantial right pleural effusion is be seen. No increase in pleural effusion is seen.
