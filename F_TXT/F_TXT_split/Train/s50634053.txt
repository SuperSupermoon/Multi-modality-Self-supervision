Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval removal of a Swan-Ganz catheter as well as endotracheal and nasogastric tubes. Left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is again seen, now terminating in the low SVC. Bilateral chest tubes are again seen. There appears to be increase in bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. Left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette has increased since the prior study which may be due to pericardial effusion; however, it may also be artificially accentuated by increase in bibasilar opacities.
