There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube with the tip terminating 4.5 cm above the carina. There is interval decreased dilatation of the trachea from the most recent prior radiograph. The lung volumes remain low with increased opacification at the left lung base greater than the right which may represent substantial atelectasis but potentially pneumonia in the appropriate setting. The lung volumes are increased with somewhat better aeratation especially at the left lung base. Tortuosity and calcification of the thoracic aorta is re-demonstrated. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen are compatible with prior cholecystectomy. Surgical clips are also noted at the left hemidiaphragm and in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
