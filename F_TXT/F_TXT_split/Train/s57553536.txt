The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Paramediastinal opacification is redemonstrated, again compatible with prior treatment changes. Right-sided Port-A-Cath has been removed. There are ill-defined bibasilar airspace opacities, worse when compared to the prior study, which may represent aspiration or infection. No definite pulmonary vascular congestion is present. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
