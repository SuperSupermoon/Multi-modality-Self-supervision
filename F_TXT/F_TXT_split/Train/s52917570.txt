AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. An ETT has been placed, seen to terminate in the trachea 5 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax is seen. Heart size may be slightly enlarged but difficult to assess because of obscuring high-positioned diaphragms. Crowded appearance of lower lobe pulmonary vasculature but no conclusive evidence for acute pulmonary infiltrates or pneumothorax on this portable chest examination. Our records do not include a preceding chest examination available for comparison.
