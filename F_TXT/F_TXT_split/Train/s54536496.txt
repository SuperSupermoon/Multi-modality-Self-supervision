AP chest compared to ___: ET tube and nasogastric tube, and left subclavian central venous line in standard placements respectively. Previous leftward mediastinal shift has resolved, but there is still severe consolidation in the left lower lobe which might be residual atelectasis or less likely pneumonia. Large right and moderate left pleural effusions are stable. The heart remains mildly enlarged and pulmonary vascular engorged, but I cannot be sure whether there is or is not mild edema because of the very large pleural effusions obscuring large parts of both lungs.
