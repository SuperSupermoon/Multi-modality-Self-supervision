Frontal radiograph of the chest when compared to the prior radiograph shows interval worsening of opacification at the bases owing to basilar atelectasis. This could represent developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical situation. There persists a small right pleural effusion. No left pleural effusion is seen. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal contour is mildly enlarged, but unchanged from the prior radiographs. Of note, there is persistent narrowing of the tracheal air column, raising the concern for tracheal stenosis.
