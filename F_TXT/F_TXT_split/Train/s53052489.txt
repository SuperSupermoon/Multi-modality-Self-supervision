Compared with 1 day earlier and allowing for technical differences, I doubt significant interval change. Probable background hyperinflation. Mild cardiomegaly. Upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis, but no focal consolidation. No gross effusion. On today's examination, the left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated. Incidental note is made of advanced glenohumeral osteoarthritis on both sides and multiple loose bodies in the left shoulder joint.
