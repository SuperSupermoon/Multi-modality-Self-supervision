There continues to be an asymmetric predominantly interstitial abnormality, left greater than right, which is slightly more pronounced and therefore still more likely represents asymmetric edema, although an atypical infectious process could also have this appearance. Clinical correlation is advised. No large effusions. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning between studies.
