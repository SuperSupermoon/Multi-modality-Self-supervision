The patient is status post right upper lobectomy. There is again evidence of left upper lobe collapse seen on CT secondary to known obstructing left juxta-hilar mass. Patchy left basilar retrocardiac opacity may relate to the left upper lobe collapse, although underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude on this study. There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle again seen. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess due to the overlying opacity from the left upper lobe collapse, although grossly cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable from the prior study. No evidence of pneumothorax.
