Moderately severe pulmonary edema, basal predominant. Bilateral pleural effusion probably moderate on the right small on the left. Heart size mildly enlarged. The course of intended atrioventricular pacer leads is difficult to follow, and would be much better assessed with conventional frontal and lateral views. No pneumothorax.
