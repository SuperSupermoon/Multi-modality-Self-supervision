The malpositioned Dobbhoff tube has been removed since yesterday. The tracheostomy tube has been replaced or repositioned, ending 5.3 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are improved since yesterday and left basilar atelectasis has improved. Increased heterogeneous opacity at the right base could be related to aspiration or asymmetric edema. Indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
