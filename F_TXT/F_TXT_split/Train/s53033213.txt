A nasogastric tube is seen extending to the level of the carina but this is not seen with certainty beyond this level. This should be assessed clinically and could be repositioned approximately 20 cm more distally to reach the level of the stomach. There is no pneumothorax effusion or CHF. Minimal linear atelectasis is seen at the left base. There are extensive dilated loops of bowel in the abdomen. Please see the abdomen film dictation for further discussion.
