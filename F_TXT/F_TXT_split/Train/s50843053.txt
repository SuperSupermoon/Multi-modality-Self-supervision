In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there are lower lung volumes with continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, pulmonary edema, in bilateral pleural effusions with compressive basilar atelectasis on both sides. Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be impossible to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view. The monitoring and support devices appear stable.
