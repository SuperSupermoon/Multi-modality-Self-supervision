Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is mild elevation of the hemidiaphragm. Overlying right base linear opacity most likely represents subsegmental atelectasis. Subtle patchy left lower lung opacity is seen, difficult to discern whether lingular or left lower lobe on this single frontal view. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. External artifact is seen projecting over the medial lung fields.
