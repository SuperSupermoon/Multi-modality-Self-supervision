Compare with ___ at 11:18 (earlier the same day), there has been interval improvement in the appearance of the right lung. The area of dense thickening seen along the expected course of the minor fissure is significantly improved, though it remains partially visible, suggesting interval re-expansion of portions of the right lung. Patchy opacity however remains visible in the aerated portions of the right lung. The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated, with blunting of the right costophrenic angle, and a small amount of pleural thickening along the right chest wall on the lung apex. The right paratracheal soft tissue density remains thickened. As before, the cardiomediastinal silhouette remains midline and appears overall unchanged. The right hilum, as before, is obscured by surrounding opacities. Also, as before, left lung remains grossly clear, without CHF focal consolidation or effusion. Minimal atelectasis is now noted.
