AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior chest radiographs available for comparison. Heart size is top normal. Left retrocardiac opacity is substantial and although might represent area of atelectasis, infectious process in this location is a possibility. Aspiration would be another option. Bilateral basal linear opacities are consistent with atelectasis. Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Clips are projecting over the upper chest, the origin is unclear related to prior surgery.
