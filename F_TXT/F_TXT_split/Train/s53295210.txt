Single AP portable radiograph of the chest. On the right side, there is a moderate sized pneumothorax which is slightly enlarged compared to the prior radiograph. There is a small to moderate extrapleural hematoma at the lateral aspect of the right lung. In the right lower lung, there is a new opacification which likely represents lower lobe collapse. Multiple right-sided rib fractures, with substantial displacement are noted, and are unchanged from the prior radiograph. On the left side, there is a moderate to large sized left pneumothorax which is new from the prior study. Additionally, there is opacification at the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, indicating lobar collapse. The heart size is normal and the mediastinum is unchanged.
