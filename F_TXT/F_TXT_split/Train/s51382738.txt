Lung volumes are low. The patient's chin obscures complete evaluation of the lung apices bilaterally. The heart remains moderately enlarged. Dense consolidative opacity in the left lung base likely reflects a combination of atelectasis with a moderate size pleural effusion, though infection cannot be excluded. There is moderate pulmonary edema. Small right pleural effusion is also noted. No pneumothorax clearly evident. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Remote left-sided rib fractures are visualized.
