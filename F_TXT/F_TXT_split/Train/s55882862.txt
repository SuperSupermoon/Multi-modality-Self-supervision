Nasogastric tube tip courses below the diaphragm with tip likely off the inferior borders of the film. Cardiac silhouette size is moderately enlarged, accentuated due to the presence of low lung volumes. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Minimal atelectasis is noted at lung bases without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen indicate prior cholecystectomy.
