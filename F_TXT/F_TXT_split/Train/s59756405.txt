AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are very low, but I see no focal pulmonary abnormality to suggest pneumonia. The heart is mildly enlarged. Pulmonary vasculature barely engorged. There is no pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural abnormality. Rightward deviation of the trachea at the level of the aortic arch has been present on prior radiographs, I am not sure whether it is pathologically just due to scoliosis and aortic tortuosity.
