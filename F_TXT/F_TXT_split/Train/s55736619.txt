Right subclavian PICC line with the tip in the mid to distal SVC. No pneumothorax. Interval reduction in lung volumes with appearance of mild interstitial edema. More focal nodular opacity at the left base could be related to edema, although raises the possibility of a loculated effusion, atelectasis, or pneumonia. There is likely a small left effusion. Small nodular opacities at both bases are stable at least back to ___, and given their density, likely represent calcified granulomas. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
