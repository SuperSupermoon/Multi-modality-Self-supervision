Right-sided PICC terminates in the proximal SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. The right hemidiaphragm appears elevated which may be due to an underlying subpulmonic pleural effusion and/or atelectasis. No priors are available for comparison. There may be minor left base atelectasis although the remainder of the left lung is essentially clear. No large left pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.
