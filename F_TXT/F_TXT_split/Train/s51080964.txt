In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of 2 pigtail catheters at the right base posttraumatic decrease in the amount of pleural fluid in the right hemithorax. Small amount of residual fluid with residual atelectasis and possibly some re-expansion edema. No evidence of pneumothorax. The left lung remains clear.
