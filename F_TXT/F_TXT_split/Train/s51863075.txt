Endotracheal tube tip terminates about 3.3 cm above the carina, and nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach. Heart size is normal. Multiple calcified lymph nodes are again visualized in the mediastinum and hilar regions as well as numerous calcified granulomas, predominantly in the right lung. New patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of recent abdominal surgery. Small left pleural effusion is noted, but no visible pneumothorax is evident.
