A single AP view of the chest was reviewed. Hilar contours are stable with multiple granulomatous calcifications found in mediastinal nodes as well. Once again there is a LLL mass or mass like consolidation (better seen on prior CXR and conforming to CT findings on ___). Chronic, moderate cardiomegaly is exaggerated by AP projection compared to PA views. A small right pleural effusion is slightly larger than on the most recent prior study, and minimal pulmonary edema has developed. Moderate left pleural abnormality is stable. There is no pneumothorax. Scarring at the right apex and chain suture material in the right apex and right mid lateral lung are again seen.
