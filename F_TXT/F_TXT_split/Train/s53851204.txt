The left PICC line continues to projects over the left brachiocephalic vein. Advancement by 7-8 cm would position its tip at the superior cavoatrial junction. Right middle lobe atelectasis is unchanged. Bilateral lower lobe airspace opacities are unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable. Left basilar airspace opacification likely due to atelectasis is also stable. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged.
