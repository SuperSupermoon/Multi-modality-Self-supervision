Comparison is made with prior study performed 10 hours earlier. There are low lung volumes. Allowing this technical factor and difference in position of the patient, there has been mild interval increase in small right and moderate left pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis larger on the left side are grossly unchanged. Left perihilar atelectasis is stable. Moderate edema is stable. There is no evident pneumothorax. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position. Left rib fractures are again noted.
