As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the left chest tube are in unchanged position. Lung volumes have increased, which might be a consequence of increased ventilatory pressure. The pleural effusion on the left is not substantially changed. No right pleural effusion. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. The extent of the postoperative retrocardiac atelectasis is constant. No evidence of pneumothorax.
