As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. There is no evidence of interval appearance of focal parenchymal opacities, notably no evidence of pneumonia. No pulmonary edema, but subtle interstitial markings might indicate mild interstitial fluid retention. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
