New right internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the proximal superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 5.4 cm above the carina, and appears to abut the lateral wall of the trachea, but patient's rotation may contribute to this apparent finding. Tip of nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach. Worsening atelectasis is present involving the right lower lobe and part of the right middle lobe, concerning for mucus plugging involving the bronchus intermedius. Left lung is clear except for minimal linear atelectasis at the left base.
