In comparison with the study of ___, there appears to be some increasing opacification in the retrocardiac region with poor definition of the descending aorta. This could reflect increased volume loss in the left lower lobe or possibly a region of consolidation if consistent with the clinical scenario. Remainder of the study is unchanged with extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities and pleural plaques. Tracheostomy tube remains in place.
