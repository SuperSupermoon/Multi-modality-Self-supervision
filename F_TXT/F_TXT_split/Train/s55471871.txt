In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial clearing of the opacification at the right base, most likely reflecting coughing of the mucus plug with clearing of prior atelectasis.

However, in the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent a focus of pneumonia. Upper lungs are essentially clear and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
