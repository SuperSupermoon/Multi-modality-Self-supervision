Interval placement of second right basilar chest tube with appearance of subcutaneous emphysema involving the right lateral chest wall. There is still likely a small right pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Stable opacity in the right perihilar and upper lung which may reflect radiation fibrosis when correlated with recent CT dated ___, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Left lung is grossly clear. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large effusions. Spinal hardware overlying the mid to lower cervical spine.
