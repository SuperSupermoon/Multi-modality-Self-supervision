1. The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. The appearance of the left hemithorax is unchanged, with more focal areas of pleural opacity both laterally and medially as well as at the left apex. There is a more focal consolidation in the left lower lung. Findings are consistent with known metastatic disease. No focal airspace consolidation is seen in the right lung. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the diffuse abnormality in the left hemithorax. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
