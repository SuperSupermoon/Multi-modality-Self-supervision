The distal aspect of a right-sided PICC is not as well seen as compared to the prior study. On this study, it appears to terminate at the proximal SVC/SVC-brachiocephalic junction and appears to have migrated proximally in the interval. No pneumothorax is seen. Since the prior study, there has been increase in bilateral perihilar and mid to lower lung opacities which could relate to fluid overload although infectious process is not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen.
