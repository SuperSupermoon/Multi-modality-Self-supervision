As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received bilateral pigtail catheters into the pleural space. Both catheters appear correctly positioned. There is no evidence of pneumothoraces. The bilateral pleural effusions have substantially decreased but are still present. Moderate areas of atelectasis are seen at both lung bases. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette persists.
