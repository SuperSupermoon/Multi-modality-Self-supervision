Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size and mediastinum are overall unremarkable but in the absence of prior studies for comparison, it is difficult to determine with certainty. Left lower lobe consolidation is present as well as slight widening of the upper mediastinum potentially reflecting atelectasis of the left upper lobe. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is demonstrated.
