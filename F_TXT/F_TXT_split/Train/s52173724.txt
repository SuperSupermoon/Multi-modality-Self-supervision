As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has an unchanged nasogastric tube. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions, accompanied by parenchymal opacities, most likely atelectatic in origin, but coexisting pneumonia cannot be excluded. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities. Unchanged moderate tortuosity of the calcified thoracic aorta.
