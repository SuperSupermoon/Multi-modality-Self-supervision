The patient is less rotated than on the prior study, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance when allowances are made for these positional differences. Interval improvement in extent of left retrocardiac opacity, which may be due to improving atelectasis. Development of poorly defined opacities in periphery of the left mid and lower lung, a nonspecific finding, for which short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude a developing infection in this region. Small left pleural effusion is also noted.
