As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left-sided chest tube. There is extensive gas collection in the left chest wall and the left cervical soft tissues. Several linear structures are projecting over the left lung apex, one of which could represent a small left apical pneumothorax. However, radiographically, only signs of pneumomediastinum are evident. These are best visible at the level of the aortic arch and along the left structures of the thoracic inlet. Mild remnant left pleural effusion. The morphology at the right lung base and the size of the cardiac silhouette are unchanged.
