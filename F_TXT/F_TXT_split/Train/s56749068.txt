Severe widespread pulmonary consolidation continues to worsen. How much is due to pneumonia and how much to concurrent pneumonia or even pulmonary hemorrhage is radiographically indeterminate. Bilateral pleural effusion is at least small to moderate, also increased over the past 2 days. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal veins are dilated indicating increased intravascular pressure or volume. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
