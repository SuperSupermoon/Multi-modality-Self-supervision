As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal tube still projects 4.6 cm above the carina. The course of a right PICC line and of a nasogastric tube are unchanged. The patient has received a new left subclavian vein device. The tip of the device projects over the midline. The lung volumes remain low, with substantial atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung area. Pre-existing perihilar right opacities have changed to the right lung base but are overall unchanged in extent. No new parenchymal opacities. Relatively extensive areas of atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung region.
