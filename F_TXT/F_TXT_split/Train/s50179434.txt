The right internal jugular line ends in satisfactory position with tip in the mid-to-distal SVC. Enteric tube is in standard position coursing towards the stomach with tip off the film. The ET tube is in satisfactory position, although the diameter of the ET tube is only one-third of the diameter of the trachea. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are worsening. Extensive air space opacification of the right lung is unchanged; however, there is increasing left lung opacification, now involving most of the left lung. Heterogeneity of the consolidation suggests a nodular component. There is also mild pulmonary edema.
