Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes resulting in bronchovascular crowding. Stable hazy alveolar opacities in the right perihilar region and right lung base are consistent with infection. The left lung is relatively clear. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
