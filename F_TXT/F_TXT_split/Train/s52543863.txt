Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates slight interval improvement in lung volumes, as well as in bibasilar atelectasis. Subsegmental and dense retrocardiac atelectasis remains, along with moderate bilateral pleural effusions which are not significantly changed. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Median sternotomy wires remain intact. A right internal jugular approach sheath remains in place with its tip in the upper SVC. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.
