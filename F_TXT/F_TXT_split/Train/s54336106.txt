A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a nasoenteric tube that extends at least into the stomach. Even given low lung volumes, which lead to increased vascular crowding, there appears to be increased pulmonary edema and probably bibasilar atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude but is not worse than before. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions persist. There is no pneumothorax.
