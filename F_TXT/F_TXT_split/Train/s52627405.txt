Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, likely due to poor inspiration. There has been interval extubation and removal of an NG tube. The left subclavian line is unchanged. There is gaseous distention of the bowel in the abdominal left upper quadrant which is causing elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. There is increased retrocardiac atelectasis since prior imaging. The heart size is borderline for cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
