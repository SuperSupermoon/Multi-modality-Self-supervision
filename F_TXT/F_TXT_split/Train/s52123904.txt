There has been interval removal of the right internal jugular catheter. A right-sided PICC line is in-situ, the tip is positioned in the distal SVC. A nasogastric tube is in-situ, the tip is not visualized but lies the left hemidiaphragm. There is silhouetting of the bilateral hemidiaphragms with increased air bronchograms and airspace opacity projecting in the left lung base when compared to the prior study. No pneumothorax seen.
