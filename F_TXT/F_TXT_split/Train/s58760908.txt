Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is relatively unchanged compared to the prior exam. There is calcification and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta which is stable. Perihilar haziness with vascular indistinctness is compatible with mild pulmonary edema, slightly improved compared to the prior exam. More focal opacities within the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. Previously noted small bilateral pleural effusions appear to have improved. No pneumothorax is detected. Remote left-sided rib fracture is present.
