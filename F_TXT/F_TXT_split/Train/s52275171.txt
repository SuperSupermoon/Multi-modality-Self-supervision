The lung volumes are low with bronchovascular crowding in the lower lungs. Given history provided, minimal opacity in the right lower lung due to aspiration cannot be excluded given technical limitations. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours and pleural surfaces are normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
