In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has taken a much better inspiration. There has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the lower clavicular level, approximately 5 cm above the carina. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size. With the improved inspiration, the pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic angle. The gas- filled stomach is more prominent than on the previous study. Consideration could be given to placement of a nasogastric tube.
