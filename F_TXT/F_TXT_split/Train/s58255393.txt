As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have minimally decreased. The overall extent and severity of the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities, widespread in both lungs, is constant. The morphology and distribution of the changes suggests moderate pulmonary edema, superimposed on an infectious or fibrotic lung process. No pleural effusions. Moderate cardiomegaly.
