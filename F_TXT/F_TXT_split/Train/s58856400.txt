Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. Comparison is also made with a prior study from ___. Extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities persist, which is compatible with known pneumonia. There may be a component of superimposed edema though this is somewhat difficult to assess given the extensive background pneumonia. A right pleural effusion appears somewhat loculated. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is impossible to assess.
