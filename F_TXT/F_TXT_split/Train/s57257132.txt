Since the prior scan the endotracheal tube has been retracted and now situated 2.6 cm above the carina. A right IJ central venous catheter has been placed terminating at the distal SVC. An enteric tube is also partially visualized. Remaining lung parenchymal findings are unchanged with markedly low lung volumes.
