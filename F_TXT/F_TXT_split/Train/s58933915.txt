In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the right chest tube has been removed. No definite pneumothorax. Lower lung volumes with continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and engorgement of pulmonary vessels consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacification is again consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe.
