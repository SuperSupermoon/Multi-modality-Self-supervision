The patient is rotated slightly to the left. There is some obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, which could be due to atelectasis; however, underlying left base retrocardiac consolidation may be present. Aside from minor right basilar atelectasis, the right lung is clear. While trace pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude, no large pleural effusions are seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The aortic knob is calcified. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable as compared to prior.
