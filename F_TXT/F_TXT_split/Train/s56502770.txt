Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates appropriately positioned tracheostomy tube. The right subclavian central venous line is 6cm below the carina and should be retracted by 15mm for more appropriate positioning. Compared to the prior radiograph, there is worsening pulmonary edema with an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Pericardial effusion is also a possibility to explain the increase in cardiac size. Worsening opacities in the perihilar and basilar regions, worse on the right, may also be explained by concurrent pneumonia. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
