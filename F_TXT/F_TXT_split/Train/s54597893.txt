Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. A Port-A-Cath resides over the right chest wall with catheter tip extending to the region of the mid SVC. An AICD is again seen over the left chest wall with lead extending into the region of the right ventricle. Subtle opacity in the medial right lung base likely reflects bronchovascular markings, though the possibility of a subtle pneumonia is difficult to exclude without a lateral view. Otherwise, the lungs are clear. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm. Calcification adjacent to the left humeral head is unchanged from prior studies, likely reflective of chronic tendinopathy.
