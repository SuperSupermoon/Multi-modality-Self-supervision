The patient is slightly rotated to the right on this portable frontal chest radiograph. Bilateral pleural effusions appear increased compared with priors. There is emphysema and increasing interstitial abnormality within the right lung more than the left. The heart size remains normal, note is made of marked mitral annular calcification. Opacity projecting behind the heart likely reflects a fluid-filled hiatal hernia. There is no pneumothorax.
