Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right chest tube with the side port overlying the right lung parenchyma. There has been interval improvement in the right-sided pneumothorax with only a small residual pneumothorax present. The lung volumes remain low, accentuating the cardiac contour and pulmonary vasculature. Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen. Right basilar atelectasis is again noted. Minimal subcutaneous emphysema at the right chest wall is likely due to insertion of the chest tube.
