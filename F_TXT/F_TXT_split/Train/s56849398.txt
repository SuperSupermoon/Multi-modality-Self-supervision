Again seen is hyperinflation and parenchymal distortion consistent with COPD. Also again seen is marked cardiomegaly with prominence of the main pulmonary artery and a calcified, slightly unfolded aorta. Probable mitral annulus calcifications. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, without overt CHF. Possible minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle, less than on ___. No focal consolidation or gross effusion is identified. Severe glenohumeral osteoarthritis this is seen bilaterally. Marked deformity of the humeral head raises the question of humeral head osteonecrosis in both shoulders.
