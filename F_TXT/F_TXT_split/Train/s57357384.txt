1) Interval placement of left pigtail type catheter over lower left lung, with marked decrease in the size of the presumed loculated left pleural effusion. 2) Small locules of air, question related to pneumothorax. may still be present. No other evidence of pneumothorax is detected. 3) Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change except for faint atelectasis in the left mid lung.
