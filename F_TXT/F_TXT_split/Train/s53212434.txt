Interval appearance of pulmonary vascular indistinctness and perihilar fullness suggestive of mild perihilar and pulmonary edema. The cavitary nodular opacity in the right upper lobe is stable. Patchy opacity at the right base is felt to more likely be related to the pulmonary edema rather than representing a superimposed infection. This can be better assessed on followup imaging. No large effusions. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given differences in patient rotation.
