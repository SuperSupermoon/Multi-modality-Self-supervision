An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 4.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. A right subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged with the tip near the cavoatrial junction. There is a persistent opacity at the right base, likely a combination of the known pneumonia and a small amount of pleural fluid. There is also likely a small left pleural effusion. No new opacity is identified. There is new mild pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous and calcified, unchanged from prior exams. The heart size is at the upper limits of normal. Flowing osteophytes are noted in the thoracic spine. Overall, there is little change from the prior exam.
