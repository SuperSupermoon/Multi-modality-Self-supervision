There has been placement of an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 4 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. There is an enteric tube whose tip and side port are below the GE junction. There is a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the distal SVC, unchanged. There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally more confluent within the right left long. This is unchanged. There are no pneumothoraces. Right axillary clips are seen.
