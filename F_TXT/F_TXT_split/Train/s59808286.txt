An AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. High positioned diaphragms indicate poor inspirational effort and obscure cardiac borders in part. Significant cardiac enlargement, however, is unlikely. Unremarkable appearance of mediastinal structures including contours of thoracic aorta. Pulmonary vasculature is not congested. No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present, and the lateral pleural sinuses are free. No pneumothorax in the apical area. Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for comparison.
