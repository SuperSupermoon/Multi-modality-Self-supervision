Comparison is made to the prior study performed six hours earlier. Tracheostomy tube is present and tip is 7 cm above the carina. Right PICC tip is in the upper to mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Mildly increased density of the left lung suggests increasing large left effusion. Pulmonary edema is mild-to-moderate and is stable. Widened mediastinum, cardiomegaly and low lung volumes are unchanged. Enteric tube tip is below the diaphragm, difficult to evaluate.
