Tracheostomy tube remains in unchanged position. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar. Reduced lung volumes are re- demonstrated. Diffuse interstitial opacities are compatible with a chronic interstitial lung disease, not substantially changed from prior. Interval development of more focal patchy opacities in the lung bases compared to the recent radiograph may reflect superimposed infection or aspiration. There may be superimposed mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Mildly distended air-filled loops of bowel are seen within the imaged upper abdomen.
