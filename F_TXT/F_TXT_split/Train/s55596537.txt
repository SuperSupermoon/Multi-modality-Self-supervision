Lung volumes are slightly reduced. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Aortic knob is calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with prominence of the pulmonary arteries, better seen on the prior study, compatible with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. Attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the lung apices is compatible with emphysema, as seen on the prior chest CTA. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. Increased interstitial opacities are noted predominantly involving the lower lobes, and likely reflective of the patient's chronic interstitial lung disease. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a trace left pleural effusion, not significantly changed from the prior exam. There is no pneumothorax.
