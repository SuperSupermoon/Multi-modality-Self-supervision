Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged from immediate prior exam. Lung volumes are low with layering bilateral pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis. Right retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis; however, infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical circumstance. A left PICC is unchanged with the tip projecting over the mid-to-low SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
