A radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessment of a nasogastric tube, which terminates within the stomach. Diffuse opacity throughout the right hemithorax likely reflects a large, layering right pleural effusion, and is associated with atelectasis and/or consolidation of the right middle and right lower lobes. Patchy left retrocardiac opacity also demonstrated. Diffuse haziness throughout the imaged portion of the upper abdomen is suggestive of ascites.
