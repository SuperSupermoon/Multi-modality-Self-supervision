A single upright portable frontal view was obtained. There is a linear opacity with volume loss and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm at the left base, most likely due to atelectasis. There is mild interstitial prominence bilaterally, although no overt pulmonary edema. There is no definite pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are normal. The heart size is mildly enlarged.
