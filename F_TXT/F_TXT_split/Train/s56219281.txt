In comparison with the study of ___, there again is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Again there are bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the left, with associated compressive basilar atelectasis. Although no definite focal consolidation is appreciated on this single frontal view, given the changes in the lungs it would be very difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
