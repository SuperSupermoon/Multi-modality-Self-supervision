Right hip central venous line tip is at the level of mid to lower SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. But there are new bibasal opacities, most likely representing aspiration although atelectasis or developing infectious process is in on the possibility. Small amount of bilateral pleural effusion is present. There is no pneumothorax. More dense opacity that is projecting sometimes at the level of the hilus and sometimes be low might potentially be outside of patient chest or within the pleura, and most likely represents benign finding.
