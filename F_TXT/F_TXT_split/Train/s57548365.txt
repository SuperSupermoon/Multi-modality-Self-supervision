Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.4 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of view. There are relatively low lung volumes. Patchy left perihilar and basilar opacities are seen, nonspecific, could be due to aspiration, infection, or in the setting of trauma, pulmonary contusion. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette mildly enlarged.
