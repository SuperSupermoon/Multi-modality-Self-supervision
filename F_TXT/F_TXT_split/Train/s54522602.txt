There are increased vascular markings with upper lobe redistribution compatible with mild pulmonary edema. There are no focal opacities. There is bilateral hilar prominence. Moderate cardiomegaly is also present. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is likely a trace left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. A tunneled right sided dialysis line is seen ending at the level of the right atrium. A left-sided central line barely crosses the midline, probably terminating at the brachiocephalic junction. There is a nasogastric tube with the tip ending below the inferior borders of the film. An endotracheal tube ends 4.2 cm above the carina.
