Comparison is made to the prior study from ___. There is again seen an intra-aortic balloon pump in the aortic arch. This could be pulled back 1-2 cm for more optimal placement. There is a Swan-Ganz catheter whose distal tip is in the left pulmonary artery and could be pulled back 2-3 cm. There is a left-sided central venous line with distal lead tip at the proximal right atrium and could be pulled back 2 cm. There are diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally which are stable. There are bilateral pleural effusions. There are no pneumothoraces. There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity.
