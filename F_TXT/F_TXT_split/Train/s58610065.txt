Since the prior study, lung volumes have decreased and there has been development of interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural effusions. Heart size is slightly larger. Retrocardiac opacification likely represents left lower lobe atelectasis. Lung apices are well aerated. Sternal wires and mediastinal clips are unremarkable. No pneumothorax.
