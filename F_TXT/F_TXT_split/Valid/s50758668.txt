AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. High-positioned diaphragms conceal major portion of cardiac silhouette, but significant cardiac enlargement is unlikely. The thoracic aorta is mildly widened and elongated but does not demonstrate any local contour abnormalities. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. There exists bilateral plate thin atelectasis. There is no evidence of any new discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate of pneumonic nature. Also, the lateral pleural sinuses are free, which excludes major pleural effusion. No pneumothorax identified in right apical area. A right internal jugular approach central venous line remains similar as on the preceding study.
