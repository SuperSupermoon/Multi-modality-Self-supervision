Patient is mildly rotated. Compared to ___, there is worsening of right perihilar parenchymal opacities. Left lung atelectasis is still present. Bilateral pleural effusions are likely unchanged. Sternotomy wires and surgical clips are well aligned and unchanged from prior. ETT terminates less than 1 cm from the carina, however this may be due to chin-tuck position of the patient. Otherwise, support lines appear unchanged from prior.
