As compared to ___ radiograph, cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and worsening asymmetrical combined alveolar and interstitial pattern which remains more severe in the right lung than the left. Observed findings may reflect asymmetrical edema, but followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful to exclude secondary superimposed process in the right lung such as infection. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally.
