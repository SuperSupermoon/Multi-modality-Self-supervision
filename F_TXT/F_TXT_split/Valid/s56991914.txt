As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The tip of the tube projects over the pre-pyloric parts of the stomach. No complications, notably no pneumothorax. The left internal jugular vein catheter is in unchanged position. In the interval, the patient has developed a new parenchymal opacity at the bases of the right upper lobe, likely reflecting pneumonia. The cardiac silhouette and the left lung are normal.
