AP portable view of the chest was obtained. A right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, distal aspect not well seen but likely terminates at the cavoatrial junction/right atrium. There is a large left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. Underlying consolidation is not excluded. There may be a trace right pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the dense left mid-to-lower hemithorax opacity. The aortic knob is calcified.
