Findings on the chest CT ___ showed probable multi focal pneumonia, predominantly in the right lung, and mild interstitial edema. Edema improved between ___ and ___, and then opacification in the right lung increased again accompanied by increasing moderate right pleural effusion. The progression of these associated findings this suggested that the interval change was primarily due to cardiac decompensation. Today edema has worsened in both lungs, and the moderate right pleural effusion is larger, although the opacification in the left lower lung is heterogeneous enough to suggest concurrent pneumonia or large scale aspiration. . Mild cardiomegaly and chronic mediastinal widening are chronic.
