Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. The left PICC line tip is at the level of superior mid SVC. The feeding tube passes below the diaphragm. Heart size and mediastinum are stable and there is additional interval progression in bibasilar consolidations and potentially bilateral pleural effusions. On the other hand, there may be minimal interval improvement in vascular engorgement.
