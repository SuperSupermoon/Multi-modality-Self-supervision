High positioned diaphragms indicate poor inspirational effort and obscure major portion of heart silhouette and result in crowded appearance of pulmonary vasculature. There is, however, no evidence of any pulmonary vascular congestion, acute infiltrate, or pneumothorax. The lateral pleural sinuses are free. No pneumothorax is observed in the apical area.
