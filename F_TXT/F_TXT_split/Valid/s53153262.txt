Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent small left-sided pleural effusion, which is not significantly changed. A small right-sided pleural effusion is also seen, and is slightly increased in size over the interval. Again seen are multiple bilateral nodules in the lungs consistent with metastatic disease. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Two chest tubes project over the left hemithorax.
