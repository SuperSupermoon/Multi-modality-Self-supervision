Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Lung volumes are low. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina and an enteric tube projects over the stomach with tip excluded from the images. Linear opacities at the bases likely represent atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
