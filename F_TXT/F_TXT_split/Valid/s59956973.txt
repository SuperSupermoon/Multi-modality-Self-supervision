Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Dense retrocardiac opacification persists, consistent with left lower lobe consolidation and small pleural effusion. Vague haziness projecting over the left upper lobe, in the region of recent chest tube, is stable. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Left ventricular assist device is remains in similar position. Left-sided PICC line ends at the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion
