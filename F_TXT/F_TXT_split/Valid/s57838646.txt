Since the thoracentesis, there has been a marked reduction in the size of the left effusion. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. Some atelectasis is present at the left base, but no obvious underlying lesion is seen. This should be reassessed, however, with a PA and lateral when reexpansion of the left lower lobe has occurred.
