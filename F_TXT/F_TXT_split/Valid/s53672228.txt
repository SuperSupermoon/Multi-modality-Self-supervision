AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained four hours earlier during the same day. During the interval, the patient has been extubated. Previously described right-sided internal jugular approach central venous line remains. Again noted is a feeding tube traversing the entire esophagus terminating in the abdomen. The present image covers the line only about 5 inches below the hiatal area. The more distal portion of the line could be followed further on the previous chest examination, still the tip of the Dobbhoff line was never included in the image. Precise location of the line is essential for patient's management. It is recommended to perform the study under fluoroscopic control. Comparison of the chest examinations does not reveal any new acute infiltrate. However, the pulmonary vascular pattern appears to be crowded, probably related to the high positioned diaphragms.
