Lungs are relatively hyperinflated with the cardiac silhouette appearing slightly smaller as compared the prior study. Mediastinal contours unremarkable. No overt pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Subtle streaky left base retrocardiac opacity is likely atelectasis and overlap of vascular structures. Right-sided central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC. Tracheostomy tube is re- demonstrated.
