As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone left thoracocentesis. There is no visualization of an apical or basal pneumothorax. The effusion has moderately decreased in extent. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Double-lumen dialysis catheter. The left heart border is delineated in a sharper manner than on the previous radiograph, likely caused by slight patient rotation to the left.
