In comparison with the study of ___, the cardio mediastinal silhouette is stable and the right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter extends to the right pulmonary artery. Continued low lung volumes. There again is increased opacification in the right mid and lower lung zones, most likely related to atelectasis above the elevated hemidiaphragmatic contour. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pneumothorax. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
