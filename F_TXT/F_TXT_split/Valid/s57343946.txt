Interval increase in opacification of the left lung is probably a function of pleural restriction and had asymmetric edema, accompanying increase in the volume of pleural fluid at the base of the left hemi thorax. Apical and basal pleural tubes are unchanged in position. Right lung is clear. Heart is mildly enlarged. Elevation of the left hemi diaphragm is probably a function of left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural fixation. No pneumothorax.
