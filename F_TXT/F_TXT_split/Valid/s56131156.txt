As compared to the previous radiograph, the interstitial component of the pre-existing pulmonary edema has minimally decreased and the pleural effusions have minimally increased in extent. Signs of pulmonary edema, however, are still clearly present. The monitoring and support devices, including the Swan-Ganz catheter, are in unchanged correct position. No new focal parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
