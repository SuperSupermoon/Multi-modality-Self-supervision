An NG tube terminates in the stomach with side port beyond the expected location the gastroesophageal junction. Partially visualized diffusely dilated air-filled loops of small bowel appear likely represent ileus or obstruction. A left Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium, unchanged. Platelike opacity in the left base likely represents atelectasis, less likely aspiration. The lung apices are not visualized. There is no large pleural effusion or evidence of pulmonary edema.
