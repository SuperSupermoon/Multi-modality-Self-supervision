The patient's neck is flexed to the right. The ET tube tip appears to be 0.6 cm above the carina. Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC. Side port of the NG tube is likely below the GE junction, with the tip out of view. There is moderate pulmonary edema. Moderate right and small to moderate left effusions appear similar to prior, allowing for differences in patient positioning. Retrocardiac opacity and silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm are similar to prior. Left upper lung distortion is similar to prior. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Aortic calcification projecting over the heart is similar to prior. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
