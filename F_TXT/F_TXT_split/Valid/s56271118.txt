There is an ET tube which terminates 3.3 cm above the carina. The right IJ central venous catheter is in stable position with tip projecting over the low SVC. Again seen is an enteric tube with distal tip projecting below the lower limit of film, not visualized. Allowing for changes in differences in rotation, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The bilateral hila are not well visualized. There is again seen pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate pulmonary edema, possibly worsened in the left lung in comparison to prior radiograph. There is stable pleural thickening most notable in the left apex. There are at least small bilateral layering pleural effusions, stable in size. There is unchanged appearance of multiple bilateral calcified lymph nodes as well as pleural and parenchymal calcifications. There is no pneumothorax.
