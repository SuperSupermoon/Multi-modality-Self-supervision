AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Available for comparison is the next preceding chest examination of ___. Relatively high positioned diaphragms obscure major portion of the heart shadow. The heart size may be at the upper limit of normal variation, but no typical configurational abnormalities identified. Unremarkable and unchanged appearance of thoracic aorta. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. No signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates are present and the lateral pleural sinuses are free. No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. Skeletal structures of the thorax grossly unremarkable. On previous examination of ___, small left-sided pleural effusion was diagnosed. This cannot be confirmed as a lateral view was not obtained at this time.
