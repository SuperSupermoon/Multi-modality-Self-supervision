Since the chest radiographs obtained 3 days prior, there has been a significant increase in left lung atelectasis with leftward mediastinal shift. Patient positioning does not account for all apparent mediastinal shift. Unable to assess for concomitant left pleural effusions or consolidation. The right lung is fully expanded and clear.
