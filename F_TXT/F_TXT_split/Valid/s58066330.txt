The inspiratory lung volumes remain low. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged, compatible with prior right lung resection. There is improved aeration of the left lung base without blunting of the costophrenic angle to suggest pleural effusion. There is increased opacification of the right lung, predominantly affecting the lower lung zone, which silhouettes the right hemidiaphragm and the right heart border. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains prominently enlarged but stable compared to the remote prior study of ___. Surgical clips are noted projecting over the right upper mediastinum. Hypertrophic degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are also noted.
