As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously well-positioned PICC line has been pulled back. The tip of the line now projects over the confluence of the brachiocephalic in the superior vena cava. The line should be advanced by approximately 2-3 cm to ensure safe position in the superior vena cava. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
