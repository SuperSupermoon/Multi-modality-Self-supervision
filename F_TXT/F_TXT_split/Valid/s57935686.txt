In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is increased opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm. This is consistent with developing pneumonia, possibly associated with some volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Increased opacification at the right base could reflect either atelectatic changes or a multifocal infiltrate.
