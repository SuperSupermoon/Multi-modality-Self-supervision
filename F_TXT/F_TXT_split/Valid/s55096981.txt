Multifocal pulmonary consolidation, most pronounced in the right lung, also at the left base, has not worsened. Apparent improvement is probably due to decreased atelectasis and perhaps resolution of a component of pulmonary edema and decrease in moderate right pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly remains.
