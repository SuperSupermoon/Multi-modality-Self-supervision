There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central line, which is seen crossing the midline. Given patient rotation, position of the catheter tip is limited although it appears to terminate in the region of the left brachiocephalic vein or the superior SVC. Otherwise, there has been no significant interval change with prior study.
