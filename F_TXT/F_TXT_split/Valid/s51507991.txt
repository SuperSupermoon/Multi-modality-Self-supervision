Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis, not significantly changed from the prior study. Again seen are multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, consistent with metastatic disease. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Two chest tubes project over the left hemithorax. Left-sided oral pacemaker is present with the leads in the appropriate position. There is no pneumothorax.
