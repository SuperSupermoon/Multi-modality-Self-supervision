In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of an IABP, which is somewhat high with the tip located only about 1.4 cm below the transverse arch of the aorta. Swan-Ganz catheter extends beyond the mediastinum into branches of the right pulmonary artery. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists, though the pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits. Some retrocardiac atelectasis is noted.
