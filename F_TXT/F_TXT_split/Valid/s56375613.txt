Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiomegaly is stable. Pacer lead tip is in a standard position in the right ventricle. Two left chest tubes are in place in unchanged position. Multiple bilateral lung nodules are again seen. Right lower lobe opacity has minimally improved due to improving atelectasis and decrease in small right effusion. Small left effusion with adjacent large atelectasis is unchanged. There are no new lung abnormalities or enlarging pneumothoraces.
