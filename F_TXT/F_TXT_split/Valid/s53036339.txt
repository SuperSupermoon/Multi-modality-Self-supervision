Assessment is somewhat limited due to marked patient rotation. The endotracheal tube tip is 2 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the distal SVC. There is persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. The heart remains enlarged. Bilateral pleural effusions are similar in appearance when compared to the prior study. Airspace opacity at the right lung base may reflect either atelectasis or infection.
