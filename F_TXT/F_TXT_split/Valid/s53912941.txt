The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear stable including enlargement of the heart and main pulmonary artery contour. The lung volumes are low. There are somewhat increased patchy densities at both lung bases which are not specific but which can probably be explained by atelectasis; particularly on the left, also perhaps coinciding small pleural effusion. There is similar mild interstitial abnormality, although vasculature appears more distinct, suggesting improvement.
