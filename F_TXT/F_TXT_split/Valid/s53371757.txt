An endotracheal tube terminates at the orifice of right mainstem bronchus. An enteric tube passes far into the stomach. Evaluation of the chest is limited due to multiple overlying lines and tubes. Within this limitation, there are widespread interstitial opacities throughout the right lung with a basilar predominance as well as the left lung base. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and subtle Kerley B lines suggesting interstitial edema. A small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is detected on this semi-erect view. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely visualized in the setting of bibasilar opacities. The mediastinal contours are prominent due to tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with partial calcification of the aortic knob. Densities projecting over the right humerus and soft tissues of the upper arm are likely external to the patient.
