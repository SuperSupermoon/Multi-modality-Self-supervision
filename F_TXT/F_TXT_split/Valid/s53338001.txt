The heart size is at upper limits of normal, but stable compared to prior study as are the mediastinal contours. The lungs continue to demonstrate bibasilar opacities, becoming slightly more confluent on the left - a developing pneumonia cannot be excluded. Pulmonary vascular congestion is also present in the setting of severe emphysema. Biapical scarring is unchanged. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
