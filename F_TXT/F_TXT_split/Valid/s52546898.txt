As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight increase in lung volumes, likely reflecting increased ventilatory pressures. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities are slightly less severe than on the previous image, but still relatively advanced and diffuse. Unchanged presence of a left pleural effusion is likely. No pneumothorax.
