Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. The heart remains stably enlarged. There is dense left basilar opacification, which may represent atelectasis or pneumonia, but is not significantly changed from prior. Median sternotomy wires and a left ventricular assist device are in place. A Swan-Ganz catheter is present with the tip ending in the right pulmonary artery, but its ifnerior loop in the right atium appears to be subluxing into the IVC. There is no pneumothorax.
