Endotracheal tube terminates 4.4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube terminates in the proximal stomach slightly higher than on the prior study and as mentioned previously can be advanced for more optimal positioning. Right subclavian catheter terminates in the mid SVC. Left basal opacity and mild vascular congestion are improved with calcified granuloma seen in the right apex.
