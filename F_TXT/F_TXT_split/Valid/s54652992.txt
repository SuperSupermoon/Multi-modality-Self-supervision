The inspiratory lung volume is improved from the most recent prior study. There is persistent pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema. A moderate-to-large right and small left pleural effusion are unchanged with underlying bibasilar opacification most likely reflecting atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged but stable.
