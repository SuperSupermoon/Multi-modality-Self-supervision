Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiac size is top normal. Large bilateral pleural effusions have markedly increased with increasing bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left. ET tube is in standard position. Left PICC tip is in the mid to lower SVC. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. Right upper lobe opacity could be due to asymmetric edema but superimposed infection cannot be excluded and attention in followup studies is recommended. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
