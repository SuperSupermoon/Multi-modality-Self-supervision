Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged position. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing to the level of the distal esophagus but the tip is not identified.

There are stable bilateral layering effusions, left greater than right, with probable associated compressive atelectasis in the lower lobes. No overt pulmonary edema. Heart remains stably enlarged. Bilateral glenohumeral degenerative changes with deformity of the left humeral head.
