Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and very tortuous aorta are unchanged. Bibasilar opacities are new; this could be due to atelectasis and/or aspiration. Minimal opacities in the left perihilar region also could be due to atelectasis or aspiration. There is no pneumothorax or large effusions. Scoliosis is again noted.
