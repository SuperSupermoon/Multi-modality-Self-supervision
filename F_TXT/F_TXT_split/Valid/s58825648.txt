Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there has been interval removal of the right-sided pleural drainage catheter. Small left apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Approximately 1.5 cm right apical pneumothorax is new. Cardiomegaly is unchanged since 1 day prior, but new since 4 days prior. Increased left lower lobe atelectasis and probably a new, small left pleural effusion. A small rounded opacity in the lateral right lung is likely a focus of atelectasis or hematoma in the prior location of the pleural drainage catheter. Lungs are otherwise fully expanded and clear.
