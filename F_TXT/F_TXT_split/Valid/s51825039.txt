Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. The feeding tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The right internal jugular Swan-___ catheter continues to have its tip in the right pulmonary outflow tract. There are layering effusions, right greater than left, with associated bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis. Increasing retrocardiac consolidation likely reflects left lower lobe collapse. There is stable bilateral diffuse airspace process suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac enlargement.
