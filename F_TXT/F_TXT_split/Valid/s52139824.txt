The heart remains enlarged. There is opacity along the medial left hemidiaphragm, which is known to correspond to a Bochdalek's hernia containing portion of the left kidney. The right Bochdalek hernia is not as well visualized on today's examination. There is patchy bibasilar opacity with likely associated layering effusions. These findings could reflect compressive atelectasis, although aspiration pneumonia should also be considered. There is also an asymmetric airspace process involving the left apex, which likely is not significantly changed dating all the way back to ___ and therefore would favor a benign process. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothoraces. Mediastinal contours are stable.
