Single AP upright portable chest radiograph was provided. There is increase of interstitial markings bilaterally although worse in the right lung, which may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm may be due to atelectasis; however, infection cannot be excluded. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The bones are intact.
