1. Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular central line, and feeding tube and left PICC line do not appear to be significantly changed, although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not identified on the current study. There continue to be bilateral layering effusions with bibasilar airspace disease, and these findings likely reflect bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis and superimposed moderate pulmonary edema. A superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. Overall, however, there has been no significant interval change. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax.
