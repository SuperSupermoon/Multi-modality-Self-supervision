AP chest radiograph was reviewed. The left internal jugular line is currently crossing the midline through the left brachiocephalic vein, most likely continuing towards the right internal jugular vein and should be repositioned. The hemodialysis catheter tip continues to be looped in the superior mid SVC. The patient is in slightly worsened pulmonary edema. There is no change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette, position of the NG tube and the ET tube.
