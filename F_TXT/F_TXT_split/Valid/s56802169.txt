Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.4 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. Both hila are slightly enlarged, which can be seen with pulmonary hypertension. Emphysema is noted. Scarring within the lung apices is present, with bullous disease in the right apex. Patchy opacities within the lung bases, more so on the left, may reflect atelectasis though aspiration is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly noted on this supine exam, though the left costophrenic angle is not completely included in the field of view.
