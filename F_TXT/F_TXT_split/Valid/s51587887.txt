Focal left basilar lucency remains similar in appearance to the ___ examination. This likely represents bullae given known history of emphysema, though differentiation from focal pneumothorax remains difficult. The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain unchanged, and there is no mediastinal shift. There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusion. A left PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The endotracheal tube terminates 5.0 cm above the carina.
