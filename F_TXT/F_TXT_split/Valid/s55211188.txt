The right-sided pigtail catheter is unchanged in position. A left-sided biventricular pacer partially obscures the left mid lung. The loculated right pleural effusion has increased, and is now moderate in size. A rounded airspace opacity in the right upper lung zone likely reflects fluid in the major fissure. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Lingular linear atelectasis is again noted. New blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a small pleural effusion.
