A new right IJ central line terminates in the mid to low SVC. The ET tube and NG tube are unchanged from prior exam. The lungs are well expanded. Diffusely increased interstitial markings are again noted in the lungs bilaterally, along with engorged pulmonary vasculature, cardiomegaly, and bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema, similar to prior exams. Opacity at the left lung base is again noted, consistent with atelectasis. No focal consolidation is seen and there is no pneumothorax.
