Heart size remains at least moderately enlarged, though assessment is somewhat limited due to the presence of a moderate-to-large right pleural effusion. A small left pleural effusion is also noted. Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis, though infection is difficult to exclude. There appears to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Fusion hardware within the lumbar spine is partially imaged.
