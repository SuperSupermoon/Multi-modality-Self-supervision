AP chest compared to ___, 9:54 a.m.: Lung volumes are low, making it difficult to distinguish right basal vascular crowding from mild interstitial edema. Heart is normal size and there is no mediastinal vascular engorgement or any pleural effusion, so edema is less likely. There is a new left perihilar pulmonary opacity partially obscured by overlying EKG leads, but I suspect there is substantial atelectasis or new pneumonia. Left PICC line ends in the mid to low SVC as before and an upper enteric tube ends in the stomach, which is not particularly distended despite severe gaseous distention of the rest of the intestinal tract in the upper abdomen. No pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged at 10:35 a.m. and I discussed the findings by telephone with the house officer covering the patient at 10:50 a.m.
