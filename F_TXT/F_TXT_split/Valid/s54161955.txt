1. Two left chest tubes and a single-lead left-sided pacer remain in place. There are multiple parenchymal pulmonary nodules consistent with known metastatic disease. Small bilateral effusions, left greater than right again are seen. In addition, there is a more focal patchy opacity at the left base which could reflect compressive atelectasis but also raises the possibility of pneumonia or aspiration. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
