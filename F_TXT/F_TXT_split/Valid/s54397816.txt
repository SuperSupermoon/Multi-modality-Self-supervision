Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates no change in aeration accounting for differences in positioning. The patient remains intubated, with the tip of the endotracheal tube positioned 3.5 cm from the level of the carina. An NG tube is in place with its tip projecting over the expected position of the stomach, and sidehole projecting over the expected position of the distal esophagus. There is mild pulmonary edema. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
