Compared with the prior study, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Fractured inferior sternotomy wire again noted. The left hemidiaphragm and left costophrenic sulcus are now better defined, suggesting interval improvement in the the left effusion and left lower lobe collapse/consolidation. Some residual left lower lobe atelectasis persists. On the right, there has been slight improvement in the right cardiophrenic opacity. The small right effusion is again seen, similar to prior. Left-greater-than-right apical pleural thickening again noted. Fractures of the mid/lower posterior right ribs again noted, presumably old. No pneumothorax detected. NG tube, pacemaker, and presumed epidural catheter again noted.
