The patient appears to be kyphotic in position. There are low lung volumes. Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature, pulmonary pulmonary arteries may be due to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Left base streaky opacity is more likely due to atelectasis rather than consolidation. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to patient position, but appears mildly enlarged.
