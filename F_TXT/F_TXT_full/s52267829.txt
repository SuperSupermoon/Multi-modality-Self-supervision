A right central line is present, tip overlying right atrium. There is mild cardiomegaly, unchanged. There are small- to moderate-sized bilateral effusions with underlying collapse or consolidation, new compared with ___. In this setting, the previously seen opacity over the right lower lung is difficult to discern. Possible upper zone redistribution, but no definite CHF. There is tubing overlying the lower chest and upper abdomen and additional tubing overlying the lower left chest. Clinical correlation to assess for the described drain is requested. Patchy density in the left greater than right upper zones may represent post-radiation change.Curvilinear densities over the left upper zone and right paratracheal regions are unchanged, ?calcified scar. The patient has known multiple known pulmonary nodules and sclerotic bone lesions, not well appreciated on this radiograph.
