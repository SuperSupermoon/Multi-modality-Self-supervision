Newly placed right chest tube has drained nearly all previous right pleural effusion and substantially reduced if not entirely cleared the previous pneumothorax. Right lower lobe is now collapsed or otherwise consolidated. Right pleural tube may be oriented mostly from front to back, and could be fissural. Clinical evaluation advised. Postoperative atelectasis in the left lower lobe may have improved, but moderate left pleural effusion persists. Postoperative widening of the cardiac portion of the mediastinal silhouette has improved. The aortic component is unchanged postoperatively. Tip of the endotracheal tube is no more than 3.5 cm below the carina with a chain elevated and should be withdrawn 2 cm to avoid inadvertent unilateral intubation. Nasogastric tube passes to the upper stomach and out of view. I cannot see either the tip or the most proximal side port to determine if the tube needs to be advanced. 2 Swan-Ganz catheter and left internal jugular central venous line are in standard placement. Study if draft
