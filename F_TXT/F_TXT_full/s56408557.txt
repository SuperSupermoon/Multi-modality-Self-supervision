Lower spinal fusion hardware is intact. Metallic densities projecting over the humeral heads likely reflect prior rotator cuff repair. Distension of the azygos vein, borderline cardiomegaly, and pulmonary vascular congestion reflect volume overload. Retrocardiac opacity reflects left lower lobe atelectasis. Gas bubble overlying the left heart is of unclear etiology, and may reflect hiatal hernia, loculated pleural air collection, or air within the lung parenchyma. Recommend obtaining a lateral view when feasible for further evaluation. Small left pleural effusion. Normal hilar contours. No pneumothorax.
