The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles. Small right pleural effusion has resolved. Bandlike bibasilar areas of subsegmental atelectasis are present. Nasogastric tube courses below the hemidiaphragm, tip not visualized. There is no pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary edema has improved. Aeration at the right base has improved, but a persistent airspace opacity at the medial right base may be due to residual atelectasis, asymmetric pulmonary edema or aspiration.
