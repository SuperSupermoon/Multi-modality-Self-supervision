Right subclavian PICC line and tracheostomy tube remain in satisfactory position. There is persistent complete opacification of the left lower lobe which could reflect a consolidated pneumonia but does raise concern for a mucus plug with subsequent collapse of the left lower lobe. Clinical correlation is advised. Moderate to large left pleural effusion which may have a loculated component as most of the opacity is centered around the left base and obscures the left hemidiaphragm. Since ___, the opacity at the right base has improved suggestive of resolving right middle lobe pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
