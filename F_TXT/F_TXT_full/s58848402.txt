Marked thoracolumbar scoliosis. A left-sided dual lead pacer remains in place and the heart remains enlarged. A prosthetic aortic valve remains in place. On the current study, the retrocardiac area is obscured by the pacemaker and therefore cannot be adequately evaluated. Lung volumes remain markedly low with crowding of the vasculature and no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated. There is interposition of the colon between the diaphragm and liver consistent with Chiladiti's. Deformity of the body of the right scapula consistent with recent trauma and possible associated right-sided rib fracture, both of which were better assessed on the CT of the chest performed ___.
