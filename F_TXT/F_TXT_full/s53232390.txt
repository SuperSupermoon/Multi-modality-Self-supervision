AP chest compared to ___ and ___, 8:03 a.m.: Tip of the new right PICC line projects over the low SVC. Feeding tube passes into the jejunum and out of view. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is exaggerated by lower lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Left lower lobe remains largely airless, more likely atelectasis than pneumonia. Small-to-moderate pleural effusions are probably present. No pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends close to the inferior cavoatrial junction.
