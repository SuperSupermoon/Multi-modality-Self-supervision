1. Persistent but reduced low lung volumes with increasing layering right pleural effusion. Left pleural pigtail catheter remains in place. Left subclavian central line with tip in proximal SVC. There is likely patchy opacity at both bases suggestive of compressive atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No large pneumothorax is seen, but evaluation of the left apex is limited. Status post median sternotomy. Assessment of overall cardiac and mediastinal contours is not possible given the marked patient rotation on the current examination and the lordotic technique.
