Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. The patient is somewhat kyphotic in position. There are low lung volumes. Opacities projecting over the left lung base may relate to vascular congestion however, consolidation due to infection is also possible. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. The aorta is unfolded. No large pleural effusion is seen, although trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. No evidence of pneumothorax. Chronic deformity of posterior right upper ribs are again noted.
