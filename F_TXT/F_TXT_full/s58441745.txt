Compared to the prior study there has been some interval decrease in the right pleural effusion however it is still moderate in size and is layering posteriorly. There has been some interval re-expansion of the right lower lobe but volume loss in that region is still present. An underlying infectious infiltrate can't be totally excluded. The left lung is clear.
