In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is increasing opacification at the right base, consistent with pleural fluid and atelectatic changes. On the left, the hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, consistent with improvement in the degree of collapse in the left lower lobe. Mild blunting of the costophrenic angle persists. The monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
