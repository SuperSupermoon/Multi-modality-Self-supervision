Endotracheal tube, left internal jugular central line and dual lumen right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. Interval removal of the right subclavian central line. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with tip not identified. The heart remains stably enlarged. There is a stable diffuse bilateral airspace process which could reflect pulmonary edema, pneumonia or ARDS. Clinical correlation is recommended. No obvious pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
