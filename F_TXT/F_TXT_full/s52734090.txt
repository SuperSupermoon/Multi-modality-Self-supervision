AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study ___ ___. Moderate cardiac enlargement persists and appearance of thoracic aorta is unchanged. There is a moderately improved inspirational effort with better aeration of the lung fields bilaterally in comparison with the previous examination. Less marked crowding of pulmonary vasculature and lesser degree of perivascular haze. The lateral pleural sinuses remain free and there is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. No signs of any discrete local pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate on this portable AP single view chest examination.
