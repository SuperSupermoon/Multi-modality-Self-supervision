Right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, similar in position. The pneumothorax is seen. There are low lung volumes and probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Bilateral perihilar opacities suggests mild pulmonary edema. Patchy right base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and pulmonary edema, although infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
