Left chest tube has changed in position, with no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Worsening bibasilar opacities are suggestive of atelectasis, and note is made of a persistent small-to-moderate right pleural effusion. Subcutaneous emphysema on the left has slightly improved.
