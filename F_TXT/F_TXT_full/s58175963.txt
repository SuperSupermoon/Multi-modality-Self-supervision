There has been interval removal of an endotracheal tube and esophageal tube. A right sided PICC is seen terminating in the upper SVC. There is complete opacification of the left lung as well as abrupt termination of the left main bronchus suggestive of obstruction and collapse of the left lung. Additionally, there are worsening opacities throughout the right lung field, which could be related to worsening pulmonary edema or possibly aspiration.
