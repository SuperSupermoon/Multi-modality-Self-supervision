Heterogeneous opacification in the left lower lobe could be aspiration or developing pneumonia. Asymmetric edema is very uncommon in the left lower lobe, but interstitial edema is beginning elsewhere. Heart size normal. Mediastinal veins mildly distended. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements. Feeding tube ends in the distal stomach.
