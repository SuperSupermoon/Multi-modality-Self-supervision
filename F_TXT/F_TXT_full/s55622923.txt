Comparison is made with prior study a day earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. The lower lobe opacities have improved, consistent with improving atelectasis and small effusion. Left perihilar and left lower lobe remaining consolidations are consistent with pneumonia. Right lower lobe opacities have improved. This could be due to atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Right subclavian catheter is in unchanged position. Left mild vascular congestion is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or new lung abnormalities.
