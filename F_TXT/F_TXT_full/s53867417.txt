Lung volumes are low. There is an opacity at the left lung base which likely reflects a moderate to large left pleural effusion and possibly adjacent compressive atelectasis, although consolidation is also possible. Heart size is difficult to evaluate given the low lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax.
