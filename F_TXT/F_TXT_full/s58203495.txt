Interval placement of left-sided chest tube with abrupt angulation at the side port. No substantial change in large partially loculated left pleural effusion and no visible pneumothorax on this semi-upright radiograph. With the exception of chest tube placement, there is otherwise no relevant short interval change in the appearance of the chest since the recent study of several hours earlier.
