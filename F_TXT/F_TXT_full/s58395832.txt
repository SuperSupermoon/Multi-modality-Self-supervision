Perihilar opacity is due to pulmonary edema. Lung volumes are lower.Compared to the prior radiograph at 03:48, there is increased basal opacification due to moderate pleural effusions and dependent edema, though compared to 2:02 , there is no significant change. The variation over such a short period of time is probably due to positioning and level of inspiration. Upper lobe vascular congestion and moderate cardiomegaly are stable. There is focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
