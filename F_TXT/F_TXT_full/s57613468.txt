As compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by worsening opacities in the right perihilar and basilar regions. It is uncertain whether this represents asymmetrical edema or a secondary process such as evolving pneumonia. Small pleural effusions have slightly increased. No other relevant changes.
