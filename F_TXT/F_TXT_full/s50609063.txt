Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with a persistent very small right apicolateral pneumothorax and improving subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall. Superimposed upon known diffuse interstitial lung disease is worsening atelectasis at the lung bases as well as an area of confluent opacity in the right lung adjacent to surgical chain sutures, probably reflecting postoperative atelectasis and contusion at the operative site.
