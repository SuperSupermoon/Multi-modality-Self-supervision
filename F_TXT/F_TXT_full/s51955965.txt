The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic and mitral valve replacements. Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar. Mild upper zone vascular redistribution suggests mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy atelectasis is present in the lung bases without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Hypertrophic changes are again noted in the thoracic spine as well as the left shoulder.
