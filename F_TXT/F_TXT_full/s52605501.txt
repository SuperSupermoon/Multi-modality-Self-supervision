There is a diffuse opacity in the right lower lobe obscuring the right hemidiaphragm with reticulation. Additionally, there is an opacity in the left base, which is poorly characterized. This may be due to a superimposed pneumonia upon chronic lung fibrosis. Finally, there is a somewhat round asymmetric right apical opacity, which could be pleural thickening and scarring, though a mass or a cavity lesion is somewhat difficult to exclude. There is no pulmonary edema. There is no definite pleural effusion, though small ones would be difficult to visualize on this limited AP exam. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Multiple calcified upper lobe nodules are likely from prior granulomatous disease. The mediastinal contours are normal. The heart is moderately enlarged. A pacemaker/ICD overlies the mid left chest with the leads in satisfactory position.
