Heart size is mildly enlarged with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Hilar contours are unremarkable. Biapical scarring is moderate greater on the right with rightward mediastinal shift; possibly representing the sequelae of prior TB. There is loss of parenchymal architecture in the upper lung fields suggestive of emphysema. Lungs are otherwise clear. Pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.
