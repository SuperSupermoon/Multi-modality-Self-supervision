As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone mediastinoscopy. There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum. The left aspects of the mediastinum are still enlarged, in almost unchanged manner. This is explained by the known type B aortic dissection, documented on a CT exam from ___. No apical cap, no pleural effusion. Low lung volumes and mild atelectasis at both lung bases, but no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
