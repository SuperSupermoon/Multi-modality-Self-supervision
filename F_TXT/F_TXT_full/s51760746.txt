Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. There is moderate pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities are seen, which could relate to prominent vascular structures, although underlying consolidation due to aspiration is not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace right pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified. Right paratracheal opacity is seen, which could be due to prominent vascular structures; however, underlying consolidation is not excluded. Chronic-appearing deformity of the proximal left humerus is partially imaged.
