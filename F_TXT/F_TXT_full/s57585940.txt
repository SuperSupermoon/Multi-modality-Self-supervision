Lung volumes are low which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears mildly enlarged. Widening of the mediastinum is due to the presence of low lung volumes. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis, without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
