As compared to yesterday, moderate right pleural effusion is stable, and there are no signs of pneumothorax. The position of the right pigtail pleural drain is unchanged, and could be fissural so it might not continue to drain effectively. The lung volume asymmetry persists, with right lung smaller than the left lung due right base atelectasis. The amount of pleural effusion is stable, mainly in the right lung base and with minimal intrafissural component. Stable left mid-lung opacity, already described in recent CT, without pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
