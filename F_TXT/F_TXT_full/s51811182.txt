Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy. The cardiac silhouette remains moderate-to-severely enlarged. The aorta is calcified. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Hazy opacity projecting over the left costophrenic angle may relate to overlying soft tissue, although a pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Small right pleural effusion is also difficult to exclude.
