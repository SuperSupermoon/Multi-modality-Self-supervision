A tracheostomy tube remains in place. Right subclavian central line has its tip in the mid-to-distal SVC unchanged. Basilar chest tube remains in position. There is a small but stable left apical lateral pneumothorax. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may represent pleural thickening versus a small effusion. There is also persistent patchy opacity at the left base which may reflect atelectasis, although an acute infectious process cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient rotation between studies.
