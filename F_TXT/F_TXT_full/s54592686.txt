A single portable frontal view of the chest was performed. A left-sided pacemaker is present with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. There is an increased appearance of the interstitium which is thought to reflect mild pulmonary edema, the degree of which is slightly worse than prior. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart remains markedly enlarged. A calcified, enlarged and tortuous aorta is again noted which also accounts for the rightward deviation of the trachea. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
