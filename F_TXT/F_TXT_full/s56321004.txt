AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Patient has recently undergone right-sided VATS procedure with right lobectomy. Chest tube has been placed and enters the lateral chest wall below, reaching the apical area before the tube reverses in caudal direction to terminate in the lower most portion of the posterior pleural sinus. There is a small approximately 1.5 cm wide apical pneumothorax, but otherwise the remaining right-sided pulmonary parenchyma appears well aerated without evidence of local infiltrates or pulmonary congestion. The previously described marked prominence of the right-sided superior mediastinum occupying the right tracheobronchial angle has disappeared. The left hemithorax does not show any new abnormalities.
