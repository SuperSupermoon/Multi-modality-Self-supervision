CHEST, SINGLE SUPINE PORTABLE AP VIEW. On the current examination, the radiopaque portion of the Dobbhoff tube overlies the lower esophagus and has not passed beyond the GE junction. Of note, on the current exam, there is slight distraction at the site of a transverse lucency in the radiopaque portion of the Dobbhoff tube, which was not seen on the most recent prior film from ___ at 21:00 p.m. Significance of this is uncertain. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
