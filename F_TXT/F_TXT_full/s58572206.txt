Portable frontal chest radiograph shows low lung volumes, which results in crowding of bronchovascular structures. A left retrocardiac opacity is presumably atelectasis, however, pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is normal size and the mediastinal contours are unremarkable. No pulmonary edema.
