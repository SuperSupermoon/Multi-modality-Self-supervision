The patient has had interval median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement. Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. ET tube terminates at the level the clavicles. The Swan-Ganz catheter projects over the main pulmonary artery. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Mediastinal drains and a left chest tube are in place. There is no pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low. New perihilar interstitial opacities are most likely due to gravitational pulmonary edema. Increased retrocardiac opacification at the left base is most likely due to atelectasis. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits despite the projection.
