Swan-Ganz catheter tip terminates in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery. Cardiomegaly is substantial. Opacity in the right lower lung might represent area of atelectasis but hemorrhage due to deep position of the Swan-Ganz catheter cannot be excluded. Please correlate with desired position of the Swan-Ganz and follow-up radiographs are recommended for documentation of the right lower lung opacity resolution.
