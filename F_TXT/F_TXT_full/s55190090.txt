AP chest compared to ___: No appreciable residual left pleural effusion, atelectasis or evidence of pneumonia. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette unchanged. Bulge in the right cardiac margin is unexplained. Routine followup with conventional chest radiographs is recommended. It could be a substantial pericardial effusion, though there is no particular mediastinal venous engorgement to suggest elevated right heart pressure. Pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged but there is no edema.
