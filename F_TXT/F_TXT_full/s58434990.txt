Worsened peripheral areas of consolidation in the periphery of the right mid and lower lung are concerning for evolving pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Superior segment left lower lobe lung mass is similar compared to the prior study as well as left apical thickening and postoperative volume loss in the left lung. Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild-to-moderate edema have worsened in the interval. There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions, but no pneumothorax is evident.
