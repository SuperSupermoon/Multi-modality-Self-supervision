CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 19:17 p.m., a tiny curvilinear density at the right lung apex is again noted. I doubt, but cannot entirely exclude, a tiny right apical pneumothorax. No interval change is identified. Otherwise, no significant change is detected. Again seen is prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette; R>L effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation; unusual appearance to the right posterior ribs and right chest wall, unchanged. Bilateral effusions are grossly stable in size.
