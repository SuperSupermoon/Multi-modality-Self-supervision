The lung volumes are low. Within the limitations of technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably within normal limits. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heterogeneous opacification involves each mid lung, greater on the right than left, with areas of entirely spared lung. There is no clear finding to suggest an abnormal vasculature.
