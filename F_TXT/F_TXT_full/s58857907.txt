Supine portable chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube tip positioned 3.4 cm from the level of the carina. An NG tube is in place, positioned over the stomach, but the tip is not seen. Retrocardiac and left lower lobe atelectasis is little changed and results in leftward mediastinal shift. There are small pleural effusions. Hilar adenopathy is unchanged.
