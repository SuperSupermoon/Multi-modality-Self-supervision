Small left pleural effusion is seen with overlying atelectasis. There may be a trace right pleural effusion. Right base opacity could be due to combination of small pleural effusion and atelectasis, but consolidation due to aspiration or pneumonia is not excluded. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation if/when patient able. There may be an additional site of subtle opacity at the right upper lung which could be due to a small focus of pneumonia or aspiration. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is stable in position.
