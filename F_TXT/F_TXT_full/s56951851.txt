In comparison with study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some increasing engorgement of indistinct pulmonary vessels consistent with worsening vascular congestion. Bilateral pleural effusions are seen with atelectatic changes at the bases, worse on the left. The hiatal hernia seen on previous lateral views is not well appreciated on the current study.
