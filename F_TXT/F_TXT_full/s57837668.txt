1. Interval intubation with the tip of the endotracheal tube 5.5 cm above the carina. Improved aeration of both lungs, particularly on the left side. There is diffuse airspace process in the right lung as well as more patchy focal process at the left lung base. These findings could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, although bilateral pneumonia should also be considered. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Previously reported more focal nodular opacity in the right upper lobe again is not well appreciated on the current study due to the diffuse airspace process. Spinal fusion hardware overlying the lower cervical spine is incompletely visualized.
