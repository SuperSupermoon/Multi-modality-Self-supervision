Right-sided atrioventricular pacemaker is obscuring part of right lung base. Mild pulmonary edema is seen with pulmonary vessel cephalisation and peribronchovascular cuffing. Left lower lobe opacity is compatible with atelectasis. Pleural effusion is small if any. There is no pneumothorax. There is a right jugular line in place with distal end that is hard to see secondary to the pacemaker lead. Surgical clips are seen in the neck possibly from previous thyroid surgery. The cardiac contour is mildly enlarged.
