Endotracheal tube has been placed. The tip is approximately 4.5 cm from the carina. Enteric tube is seen passing below the inferior field of view. Vascular stent again noted in the right brachiocephalic vein/SVC region. Degree of cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged given differences in positioning and inspiratory volume. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to superimposed effusion.
