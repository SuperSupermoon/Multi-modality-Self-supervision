There is again seen a left-sided PICC line with distal tip projecting over the mid SVC. There has been interval removal of NG tube. There is an unchanged tortuous thoracic aorta. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There has been interval development of right basilar opacity which obscures the right hemidiaphragm, which probably represents a new right lower lobe pneumonia given clinical context. There are no effusions. There is no left pneumothorax. There is no right pneumothorax seen, however this cannot be evaluated fully as the right lung apex is not seen.
