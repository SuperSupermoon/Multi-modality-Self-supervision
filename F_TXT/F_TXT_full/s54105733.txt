AP upright portable chest radiograph provided. There is a linear metallic density projecting in the right axilla, which was also seen on prior radiographs and is concerning for a retained foreign body. A tracheostomy tube is noted. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present. There is increased retrocardiac opacity which could reflect suboptimal penetration, though the possibility of left lower lobe consolidation is not excluded. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear. No pneumothorax is seen. Bony structures appear intact.
