As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube have been removed. The large parenchymal opacities at the right lung basis and in the left perihilar areas, however, are unchanged. Unchanged appearance of the moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette. No larger pleural effusions. No new parenchymal opacities.
