AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Severe heterogeneous opacification of the right lung has progressed dramatically between ___ when chest CT scans suggested limited carcinomatosis in the right lung, inferior to the apical mass. Although some pneumonia is certainly a possibility and there could be components of hemorrhage, by virtue of the interstitial quality of this abnormality, including septal lines at the right lung base and the absence of focal consolidation, the abnomality throughout the right lung is more likely to be progression or complication of lung cancer, i.e., disseminated lymphohematogenous metastasis or possibly unilateral pulmonary venous thrombosis, rather than pneumonia. Left lung is clear. Heart size is normal. ET tube and enteric tube are in standard placements. Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 9:50 a.m.
