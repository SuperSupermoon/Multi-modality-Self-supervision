A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged with dual leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. In the interim from the most recent prior study, a right internal jugular line has been removed. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are slightly increased from ___ with potentially increase in mild pulmonary edema. No definitive evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated in the setting of bilateral pleural effusions. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits and unchanged with calcification of the aortic knob. The patient is status post median sternotomy with discontinuous inferior most sternal wire, unchanged. There are acute mildly displaced fractures of the right posterior fifth and sixth ribs as well as the lateral right lower ribs, possibly seventh and eighth. No displaced left-sided rib fractures are identified.
