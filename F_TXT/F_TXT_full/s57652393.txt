In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. Dual-channel pacer device is in place with 1 lead extending to the right atrium and the other difficult to assess. Nasogastric tube is in place though difficult to see distal to the lower esophagus. If necessary, repeat study with the superior aspect at the hilum using abdominal TECHNIQUE could be performed to clearly demonstrate the tip of the tube. There has been the development of extensive bilateral opacification which most likely represents pulmonary edema. In the appropriate clinical setting, some element of superimposed pneumonia could be considered. The right central catheter is been removed.
