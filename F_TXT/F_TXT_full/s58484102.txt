A balloon pump is seen extending from the abdominal aorta to the level of the proximal descending thoracic aorta but with the metallic marker oriented horizontally, suggesting malpositioning of the balloon. The aorta remains tortuous in appearance. There is calcification of the aortic knob. The mediastinal contours are slightly prominent due to unfolding of the aorta but appears stable. The hilar contours are within normal limits. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size. There is streaky opacification in the right lung apex along the right paratracheal stripe, which may represent atelectasis or aspiration. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
