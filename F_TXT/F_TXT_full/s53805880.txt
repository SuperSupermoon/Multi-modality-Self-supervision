As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.6 cm above the carinal. The right internal jugular vein catheter and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. The volume of both the left and the right hemi thorax has increased, likely as an consequence of intubation, but the bilateral predominantly perihilar extensive and severe parenchymal opacities are even denser than on the previous radiograph. The changes are reflecting centralized pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly, retrocardiac atelectasis. No pleural effusions.
