As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation of the lung parenchyma. However, the bilateral parenchymal pre-existing opacities are still clearly visualized and are overall, not substantially changed as compared to the previous image. No new opacities. No pleural effusions. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.
