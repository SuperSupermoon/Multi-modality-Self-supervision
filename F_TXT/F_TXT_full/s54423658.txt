CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 5:46 a.m., an NG tube is again noted. It overlies the lower chest, but appears to overlie the gastric fundus, which is elevated due to a diaphragmatic herniation, as seen on ___ CT scan. If clinically indicated, a lateral view could help to confirm this. Again noted is ET tube in satisfactory position above the carina. Prominence of right paratracheal soft tissues is noted, but may be accentuated due to patient rotation. There is focal opacity in the right upper zone and patchy opacity in the right lower zone medially. These findings are better depicted on ___ CT scan. The lung apices are excluded from the film. Electronic battery pack is noted overlying left iliac crest.
