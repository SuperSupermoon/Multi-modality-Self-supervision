AP chest compared to ___: Previous subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall and neck has resolved. Several abnormal interfaces in the right hemithorax can be explained by increasing small-to-moderate right pleural effusion and atelectasis, also present in linear form at the base of the left lung. If there is any right pneumothorax, it is quite small. Left upper lung is clear. Heart size is normal.
