CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison. There is an extremely large mass in the superior/mid mediastinum with maximal overall width of approximately ___.5 cm. The mass obscures the aortic knob, making it difficult to exclude aortic pathology. There is slight biapical pleural thickening. The cardiac contours are also partially obscured, but heart size is likely at the upper limits of normal. Pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. There are small, right-greater-than-left effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. No CHF.
