Single portable view of the chest. Bibasilar opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragms are suggestive of effusions, left greater than right, new since prior. Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen. Degree of cardiomegaly is difficult to assess given silhouetting due to bilateral effusions. Trachea is deviated to the left of the thoracic inlet secondary to tortuosity of the great vessels, better characterized by prior CT. Median sternotomy wires and left chest wall single-lead pacing device are identified. Dense mitral annular calcifications again noted.
