There is flattening of the bilateral hemidiaphragms and hyperexpansion of the lungs compatible with COPD. Ill-defined airspace opacities in the right mid lung zone may represent infectious foci; however, pulmonary nodules or masses are not excluded. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged as noted on prior studies. A left pectoral pacemaker is in place with two leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The right hilum is prominent on the current examination. The trachea is midline. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
