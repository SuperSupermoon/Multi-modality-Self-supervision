As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Given a change in patient position, the right costophrenic sinus is now blunted, likely due to a small pleural effusion. On the other hand, the left hemithorax has increased in transparency, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Unchanged monitoring and support devices. No new parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.
