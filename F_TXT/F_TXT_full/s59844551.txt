The lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes most pronounced in the lung apices. The heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The pulmonary vascularity is normal. Previously noted nodules distributed in both lungs are better assessed on the prior CT. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No displaced fractures are seen. Curvilinear lucency within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen is compatible with gas within a colonic loop of bowel, and is not extraluminal.
