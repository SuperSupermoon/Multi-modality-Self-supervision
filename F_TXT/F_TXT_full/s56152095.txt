Lung volumes are low. Cardiomegaly and mild central vascular pulmonary congestion is again noted. Persistent left retrocardiac opacity has slightly improved and no longer silhouettes the left hemidiaphragm. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. Median sternotomy wires are well aligned. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Possible fibrous dysplasia is noted within the proximal left humerus, unchanged from prior examination.
