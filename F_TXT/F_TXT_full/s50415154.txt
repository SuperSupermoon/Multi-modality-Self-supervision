Right middle lobe atelectasis has improved, but the lower lobe is still collapsed. Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved. Heart is still moderately enlarged. At least a small right pleural effusion is present, but it is hard to say whether the volume has changed. There is no pneumothorax. Ends at the level of the sternal notch, no less than 7.5 cm from the carina, could be advanced 2 cm for more secure seating, nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view, and the left internal jugular line ends in the left brachiocephalic vein.
