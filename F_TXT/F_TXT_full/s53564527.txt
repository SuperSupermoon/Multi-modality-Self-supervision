Left PICC tip terminates in the lower SVC. Lung volumes are low. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, and there are continued multifocal opacities within the left upper and lower lung fields as well as within the right upper lung field, findings concerning for pneumonia. Additionally, bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate in size appear unchanged. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures persists. Underlying emphysematous changes are most pronounced within the lung apices. Diffuse gaseous distention of abdominal bowel loops are seen within the upper abdomen. Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is present with unchanged compression deformities within the lower thoracic spine. Remote left sided rib fractures are again seen.
