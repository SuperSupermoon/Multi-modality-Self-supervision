The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There are patchy opacities throughout the lungs, particularly in the perihilar and bibasilar regions, suggestive of pulmonary edema. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle, suggestive of a small effusion. A right-sided subclavian dual-lumen catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava and right atrium. Sternotomy wires are in place. Multiple surgical clips project over the mediastinum and right upper quadrant. No acute bony abnormality is identified.
