In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again retrocardiac opacification with poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with continued volume loss in the left lower lobe. The remainder of the examination is unchanged with no evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion. Monitoring and support devices remain in place and the widely separated fracture of the right clavicle is again seen.
