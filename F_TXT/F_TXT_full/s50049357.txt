Tracheostomy tube, feeding tube, and left subclavian central venous catheter are unchanged in position. Left upper lobe parenchymal cavitary opacities are similar, perhaps slightly decreased from the prior study. The bases are better aerated bilaterally with decrease in retrocardiac opacification. Trace left pleural effusion may be present. Cardiac size and cardiomediastinal silhouette are unchanged.
