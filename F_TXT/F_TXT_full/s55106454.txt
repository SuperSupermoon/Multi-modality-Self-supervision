New right central venous catheter terminates in the region of the upper SVC, however takes a more lateralized course than usual, with air surrounding the tip of the catheter. There appears to be a new large right pneumothorax with increased atelectasis of the right lung and paucity of lung markings beyond the border of the atelectatic lung. The left lung has a stable appearance. There is no shift of the mediastinal structures to suggest the presence of tension. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
