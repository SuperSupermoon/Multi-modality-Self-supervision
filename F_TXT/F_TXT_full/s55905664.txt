As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Minimal increase in lung volumes, likely reflecting improved ventilation. These changes particularly obvious at the lung bases. The monitoring and support devices continue to be in correct position. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
