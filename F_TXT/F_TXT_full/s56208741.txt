The right IJ central line terminates in the distal SVC. The endotracheal tube is approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. The enteric to terminates in the stomach with side port beyond the GE junction. Lung volumes are low. The heart is mildly enlarged. Retrocardiac opacity has worsened consistent with collapse of the left lower lobe and left pleural effusion. Increased opacification of the left upper lobe is likely secondary to increased atelectasis. The right lung is clear. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
