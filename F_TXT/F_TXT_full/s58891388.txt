FINDINGS There has been some interval clearing of the left upper lung which may reflect a component of edema; however, infiltrative pulmonary abnormality of the right lung and left lower lung persist. Heart size remains large but indeterminate because heart borders are obscured by the lung abnormality. Likely small to moderate left pleural effusion unchanged.
