Single portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates hypoinflated lungs with vascular crowding and patchy atelectasis. Moderate pulmonary edema noted. No large pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is likely accentuated due to low lung volumes. Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable.
