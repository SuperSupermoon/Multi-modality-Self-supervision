The endotracheal tube tip resides 3.7 cm above the carina. The NG tube courses inferiorly along the midline into the upper abdomen though the tip is not imaged. Bilateral pleural effusions are present with lower lobe opacities most compatible with atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema is likely present as well. Further evaluation is limited due to patient positioning.
