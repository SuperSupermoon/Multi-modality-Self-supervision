Compared with 1 day earlier, the right chest tube is been removed. Compared to the prior film, the right apical pneumothorax appears smaller and there has been slight re-expansion of the right lung, with some residual opacity noted. Surgical sutures noted. Again seen is subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest. Patchy opacity at the left lung base is similar, but slightly more pronounced than on the prior film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, similar prior, without overt CHF. Left-sided pacemaker is present, not significantly changed. There appear to be some abandoned leads.
