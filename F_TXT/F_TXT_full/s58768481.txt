A single portable chest radiograph was obtained. An endotracheal tube terminates appropriately for 4.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube looped in the stomach and extends inferiorly out of the view. The tip of a left subclavian central catheter is within the left brachycephalic vein. There is a sharp angulation in the external portion of the catheter tubing. Lung volumes are low, accentuating the interstitial markings. Cardiomegaly is mild.
