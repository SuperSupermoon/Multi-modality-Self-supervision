The patient has been intubated since the prior study, the tip of the endotracheal tube is 4 cm above the level the carina. A nasogastric tube is in-situ, the tip is in the stomach. There is bibasilar atelectasis, similar in degree compared to the prior study. Even allowing for the projection, the heart appears enlarged and there is haziness of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No consolidation or pneumothorax seen.
