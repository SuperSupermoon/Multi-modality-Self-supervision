Since the prior study performed 2 hours earlier, there has been no significant interval change. There is persistent pulmonary vascular congestion, without overt pulmonary edema. Again noted is dense retrocardiac consolidation, which may represent atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Right PICC terminates at the mid SVC.
