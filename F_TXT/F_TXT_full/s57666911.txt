AP chest compared to ___: Right pleural tube still traverses the right mid hemithorax, with its tip impinging on the mediastinum just to the left of midline. Left pleural tube inclined obliquely ending at the level of the aortic arch is unchanged. Atelectasis in the left lung is probably responsible for the bulk of leftward mediastinal shift, exaggerated by rotation. Small left pleural effusion is present. There is no appreciable right pleural effusion or pneumothorax on either side. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC, and upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. A left jugular line is unchanged in position more lateral than generally seen probably a reflection of anatomic variation.
