The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including a large aneurysm arising from the aortic arch as well as cardiomegaly. A moderate-sized hiatal hernia is again present although not as well depicted. There is no definite pleural effusion, although small pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude. This study shows hazy opacification of the right mid-to-lower lung. Opacities are most extensive in the right lower lung.
