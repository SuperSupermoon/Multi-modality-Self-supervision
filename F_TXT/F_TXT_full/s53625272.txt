Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube extending 3.7 cm above the carina. An enteric tube traverses inferiorly into the stomach with side port within the gastric cavity. The heart is normal in size, allowing for AP projection. Thoracic aorta is unfolded with atherosclerotic calcifications. The right heart border is obscured by dense opacities throughout the right lung which likely represents asymmetric pulmonary edema. Small effusions cannot be excluded. There is remote lateral fracture in the right 9th rib.
