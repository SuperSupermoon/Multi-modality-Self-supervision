There are low inspiratory volumes. Allowing for differences in positioning, no definite interval change. Probable atelectasis at the left lung base. Changes related to aspiration are considered less likely, but are also in the differential. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is poorly delineated due to positioning and low inspiratory volumes. Mild vascular plethora is likely accounted for by low inspiratory volumes. No gross effusion. No pneumothorax detected. Tubing coiled over the upper abdomen could represent an orogastric tube of some type, but is incompletely visualized, as it extends below the inferior edge of this film. The abdominal film from ___ at 14:54 shows tubing coiled over the proximal stomach. No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.
