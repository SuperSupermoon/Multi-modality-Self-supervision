AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The left costophrenic angle is not well seen, sharp, which may be due to overlying soft tissue, very trace pleural effusion cannot be excluded, although no large pleural effusion is seen. There is pulmonary vascular congestion. Right base patchy opacity may relate to prominent vasculature, although underlying consolidation is not excluded. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. There is streaky left base retrocardiac opacity, most likely atelectasis, although in the appropriate clinical setting, early consolidation is not excluded.
