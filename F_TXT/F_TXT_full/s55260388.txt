1. Endotracheal tube has its tip at thoracic inlet, approximately 5.0-5.5 cm above the carina. Left subclavian central line with its tip in the proximal SVC, unchanged. There is a large caliber tubular structure overlying the left lateral neck with its tip overlying the region of the aortic knob. A phone discussion with the patient's nurse, ___, on ___ at 1:10 p.m. confirms that this is not an intravascular catheter as no catheters have been placed since the previous chest of ___. Therefore, this likely is extrinsic to the patient. Overall, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is a persistent hazy opacity at the left base with associated retrocardiac opacity which likely reflects a combination of pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumothorax.
