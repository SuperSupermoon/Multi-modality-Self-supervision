1. Interval removal of the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. Interval removal of the right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with the introducer sheath remaining in place. The heart remains enlarged. There has been interval appearance of patchy opacity in the right medial lung base as well as the left lung base and in the left mid lung. In addition, the pulmonary vasculature is less well defined. Therefore, these findings most likely reflect pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. There is also some stable lucency along the left heart border, likely representing pneumopericardium in this relatively recent postoperative patient. No pneumothorax. Probable small layering left effusion.
