Endotracheal tube ends approximately 5.4 cm above the carina and is adequately positioned. An orogastric tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach and is appropriate. Known loculated air at the right lung base is now replaced with fluid. Bilateral lower lung atelectasis and presumed small left pleural effusions are unchanged. Mildly enlarged heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours have a similar appearance. Right-sided internal jugular line ends at cavoatrial junction.
