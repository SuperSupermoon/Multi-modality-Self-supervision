Assessment is limited by patient positioning and rotation. There are low lung volumes. Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is grossly unchanged. The aorta appears diffusely calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours are not substantially changed in the interval. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is noted and mild pulmonary vascular congestion is likely present. Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
