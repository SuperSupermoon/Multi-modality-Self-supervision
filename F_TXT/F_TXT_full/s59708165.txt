A left chest tube remains in place. The side port overlies the lateral left rib cage, and is difficult to determine from this single view whether the side port is intrapleural or extrapleural. Small left apical pneumothorax has minimally increased in size. Moderate loculated left pleural effusion is slightly smaller, and continues to be accompanied by adjacent atelectasis in the left mid and lower lung regions. On the right, a small pleural effusion is unchanged, but adjacent atelectasis has improved. Numerous contiguous left segmental rib fractures are again demonstrated concerning for flail chest.
