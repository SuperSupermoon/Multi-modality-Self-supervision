Moderate right apical lateral pneumothorax is similar to the recent study. The patient is status post right upper lobe sleeve lobectomy procedure, and note is made of a homogeneous opacity extending superiorly from the right hilum, possibly due to postoperative collapse of the right middle lobe but not fully characterized on this portable radiograph. Marked subcutaneous emphysema has progressed since the previous study.
