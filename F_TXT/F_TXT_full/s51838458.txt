There is a persistent and perhaps somewhat increased pattern of hazy lung opacification and prominent reticular markings suggesting moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. Pleural effusions are not excluded and a right-sided pleural effusion may be suspected based on slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle. There is no pneumothorax.
