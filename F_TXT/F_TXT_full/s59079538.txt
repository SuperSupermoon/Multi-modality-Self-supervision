There are bilateral moderate to large layering pleural effusions which limit evaluation of the underlying lung parenchyma. However, there is a suggestion that there may be mild pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac consolidation likely reflects lower lobe collapse. No obvious pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-supine technique. Endotracheal tube, left internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position, although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not included on the study.
