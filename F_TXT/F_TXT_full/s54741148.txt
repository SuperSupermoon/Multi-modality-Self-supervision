Endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above the carina. An enteric tube terminates in the stomach and the side-port is not well-visualized, likely near the gastroesophageal junction. Postoperative mediastinum, hila, and cardiac silhouette are normal. There is mild left lower lobe atelectasis but no pneumonia or pulmonary edema. A left chest wall pacemaker has intact ventricular and atrial leads. Coronary artery calcifications are prominent. Dashed radiopaque stimulated is seen overlying the thoracic spine. Chronic right-sided rib fractures and pleural thickening are noted.
