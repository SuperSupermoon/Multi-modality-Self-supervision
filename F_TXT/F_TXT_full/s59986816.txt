Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates the patient is rotated to the right. There are increased interstitial markings and central pulmonary vascular congestion, consistent with pulmonary edema. A right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen in standard position, terminating in the low SVC. There is some bibasilar atelectasis with possible small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax or area of focal consolidation. Heart size is difficult to assess given the patient is rotated to the right and AP projection of this portable radiograph, however, it is likely top normal in size. A nipple shadow is seen projecting just above the left hemidiaphragm.
