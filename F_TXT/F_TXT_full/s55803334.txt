AP view of the chest provided. Compared to prior study, degree of pulmonary vascular engorgement is unchanged but there is no overt edema. Increased retrocardiac and left base opacity is likely due to atelectasis with overlying pleural effusion. There may be a small right pleural effusion as well. Postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Right IJ line terminates in the mid SVC.
