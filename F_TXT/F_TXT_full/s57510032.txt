There is extensive airspace opacification involving the entire right lung, new compared to the prior exam. There is also patchy left basilar opacification. There is evidence of mild volume loss in the right lung as well. Thickening of the right paratracheal stripe is suggestive of underlying mediastinal lymphadenopathy. There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. The heart size is normal.
