In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, right pigtail pleural catheter has changed slightly in position, and a small right apical pneumothorax is newly visible. Interval removal of the left pleural catheter, with apparent decrease in size of left pleural effusion, difficult to compare due to positional differences between the exams. No definite left pneumothorax.
