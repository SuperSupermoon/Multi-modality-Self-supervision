Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There has been interval placement of a right chest tube and interval appearance of patchy opacity in the right mid lung which likely is postoperative in etiology given the presence of chain sutures in this vicinity. No large pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished as the patient was imaged supine. Lung volumes are lower and the vasculature is slightly prominent but no overt pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. Numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules are better appreciated on the recent chest CT dated ___.
