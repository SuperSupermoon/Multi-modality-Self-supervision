Compared to the prior study, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is increased retrocardiac density and hazy opacity at the left base, with minimal atelectasis at the right base. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged. An ET tube tip is not well seen, but appears to lie approximately 6.1 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film. A left-sided PICC line is present, tip over proximal SVC.
