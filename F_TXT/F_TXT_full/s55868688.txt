AS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS EXAMINATION, NO RELEVANT CHANGE IS SEEN. LOW LUNG VOLUMES. MODERATE CARDIOMEGALY WITH AREAS OF ATELECTASIS AT THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT LUNG BASES. NO LARGER PLEURAL EFFUSIONS. THE MONITORING AND SUPPORT DEVICES, INCLUDING THE ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE AND THE NASOGASTRIC TUBE ARE IN CONSTANT POSITION. OVERALL, NOTABLY ON THE RIGHT, THE RADIODENSITY OF THE LUNG PARENCHYMA HAS DECREASED, LIKELY REFLECTING IMPROVED VENTILATION OR HIGHER RESPIRATORY PRESSURES.
