Nasogastric tube tip and side port are within a massively distended stomach. Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Bulging of the distal mediastinal contours likely reflects the paraesophageal complex collection, as seen on the previous CT. Coronary artery stents are re- demonstrated. Atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob are again noted. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal consolidation. Trace left pleural effusion is unchanged. No pneumothorax. Radiopaque foci in the upper abdomen likely reflect retained barium within colonic diverticula.
