There is significant rightward rotation of the patient on the current radiograph. Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. Asymmetrically increased hazy opacity of the left hemi thorax relates to overlying soft tissue. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is no evidence of a displaced rib fracture.
