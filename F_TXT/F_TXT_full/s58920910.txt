ET tube has been repositioned, in standard placement. Slight increase in the extent of opacification in the right lung is probably due to a decrease in moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right still greater than left, rather than much change in severe bilateral pulmonary consolidation due to pneumonia and/or pulmonary hemorrhage. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Other lines and tubes in stable, standard positions. No pneumothorax.
