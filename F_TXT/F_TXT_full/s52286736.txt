As compared to the previous radiograph, the vena cava device has been removed. The Swan-Ganz catheter was also removed. The patient now carries an endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube and a left subclavian access line, all of which are in normal position. The lung volumes are normal. There is evidence of mild pulmonary edema as well as of parenchymal opacities, predominating in the perihilar and upper lung regions. The extent and severity of these opacities is not substantially changed as compared to the prior image. No pleural effusions. No new opacities. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
