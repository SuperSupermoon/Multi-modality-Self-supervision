AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day. Position of previously described tracheostomy cannula and right-sided internal jugular approach central venous line is unchanged. A new Dobbhoff line is seen to reach below the hiatus, now placed in the fundus of the stomach. No pneumothorax or any other chest interval change can be identified.
