There has been interval placement of a Y stent. There has also been interval placement of a right-sided central venous catheter, large bore, terminating in the right atrium. No pneumothorax seen. Midline tracheostomy tube is again seen. Left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is stable in position given differences in patient positioning. Scope device previously projecting over the esophagus has been removed in the interval. There is stable right upper lobe opacity consistent with post-lobectomy changes. There has been interval increase in bibasilar opacities which may be due to worsening atelectasis and aspiration, although developing infection is not excluded. Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles may be due to small pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears slightly more prominent as compared to the prior study, although this may in part relate to lower lung volumes. Attention at followup. There is a thin tubular structure which may represent a subcutaneous line which projects over the right axilla but does not extend more proximally than the axillary region. Clinical correlation advised.
