There is a left-sided pleural catheter which is unchanged in position. No pneumothoraces are identified. There is volume loss on the left side. Subcutaneous emphysema is seen in the left lateral chest wall. There is some increased density within the left lung laterally, however, this may be due to the volume loss. The right lung is well aerated.
