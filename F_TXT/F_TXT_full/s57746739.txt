Marked thoracolumbar scoliosis which markedly distorts the appearance of the thoracic cavity. However, given differences in positioning between studies, the lungs remain clear. No pulmonary edema or pleural effusions are appreciated. Overall, cardiac size is stable. Scattered air is seen in nondistended loops of bowel.
