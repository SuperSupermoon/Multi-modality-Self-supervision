Severe pulmonary opacification in the right lung which worsened on ___ has progressed since earlier in the day. I do not believe there has been any interval decrease in the volume of fluid in the left pneumonectomy space to suggest a stump leak. There is no right pneumothorax. Mediastinum is still shifted mildly into the left hemi thorax. ET tube in standard placement. Left subclavian infusion port and PIC line end in the lower and mid SVC respectively.
