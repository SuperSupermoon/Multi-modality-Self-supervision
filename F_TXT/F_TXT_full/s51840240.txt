Compared with prior radiographs on ___, there has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube, ETT and nasogastric tube, as well as removal of a right IJ catheter. The nasogastric tube terminates above the left hemidiaphragm, possibly in a previously seen hiatal hernia. The ET tube is appropriately positioned. There is no pneumothorax. A right layering pleural effusion and atelectasis are similar to prior.
