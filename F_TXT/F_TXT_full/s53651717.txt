Note is made that the study was obtained yesterday at 4:40 p.m. and brought to our attention today at 8:05 a.m. There is linear vertical lucency running parallel to the right border of the spine, continuing from the level of the carina upwards towards the neck and might potentially reflect air within the mediastinum. Alternatively, it can represent air within the neoesophagus but that is less likely. There is interval improvement of the right mid lung consolidation. The bulging contour of the right mid mediastinum most likely reflects dilated neoesophagus. There is new left lower lung opacity that potentially might reflect aspiration. Heart size is unremarkable. Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 9 a.m. with the recommendation to repeat chest radiograph to exclude the possibility of pneumomediastinum and discover of the findings was made 1 hour ago and Dr. ___ was immediately paged.
