Triple lead left-sided AICD is again seen with leads in the expected positions of the right ventricle, coronary sinus, and right atrium. The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged. The size of the cardiac silhouette appears increased as compared to the prior study although this may in part relate to a AP, portable technique. There is prominence of the hila and central pulmonary vasculature suggesting vascular engorgement and pulmonary vascular congestion with possible mild edema. . No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
