1. Status post median sternotomy with stable post-operative cardiac and mediastinal contours. There is persistent linear opacity at the left base suggestive of subsegmental atelectasis. The pulmonary vasculature now appears somewhat ill defined, and there is fullness in the perihilar region. These findings likely reflect mild pulmonary edema. There is a layering left effusion. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
