Lung volumes remain low, but are slightly greater than on the prior study. The previously noted widening of the mediastinum is slightly less apparent. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present as well as linear juxtahilar and basilar foci of atelectasis. Small pleural effusions are evident bilaterally. Previously reported lucency adjacent to the right cardiomediastinal contour has decreased in extent. If warranted clinically, lateral decubitus radiograph could be considered to exclude a small anteromedial right pneumothorax.
