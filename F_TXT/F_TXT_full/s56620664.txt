There is a new small right 8 apical pneumothorax, new compared with ___. The right-sided again seen is a right-sided chest tube. Hazy opacity at the right lung base laterally is new and could represent atelectasis or, alternatively, layering pleural fluid. An additional atelectasis is present in the right cardiophrenic region/medial lung base. At the left lung base left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated, with subsegmental atelectasis. No definite consolidation. No gross effusion. No focal infiltrate or pneumothorax. Small tubular density projecting between the medial clavicular heads over the lower trachea, compatible with a stent graft, as again noted.
