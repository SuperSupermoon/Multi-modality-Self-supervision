As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of bilateral apical and perihilar fibrotic lung disease. There also is unchanged cardiomegaly with slightly increased diameters of the pulmonary arteries, notably on the left. Blunting of the right costophrenic sinuses suggestive of a small pleural effusion. The vascular diameters are at the upper range of normal, potentially indicative of mild fluid overload.
