Low lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly. Bilateral blunting of the costophrenic sinuses, caused by a small pleural effusions. Mild dilatation of the vascular structures, signs of mild bilateral basal apical blood flow redistribution. Fluid marking of the interstitial structures such as fissures and bronchial walls. Overall, the findings consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Mild atelectasis at the lung bases. Coexisting pneumonia cannot be excluded but in the well inflated parts of the lung parenchyma. There is no evidence for infectious changes.
