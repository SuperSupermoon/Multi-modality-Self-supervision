Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier. ET tube is in standard position, the tip is 3.5 cm above the carina. Small right pneumothorax has minimally decreased. Right lung opacities have markedly improved. There is better expansion of the right lung. There is persistent consolidation in the lung that occupies the right apex; attention should be paid in this finding. The left lung is clear. Right chest tube is in unchanged position.
