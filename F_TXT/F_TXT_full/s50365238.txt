Compared ___ at 13:16, no obvious interval change is detected. Again seen is cardiomegaly, with stable cardiomediastinal silhouette. Probable background COPD. There is upper zone redistribution. Extensive increased interstitial markings, including increased markings at the right lung base laterally, and a small amount of pleural fluid and/or thickening at the right cardiophrenic angle are unchanged. As previously noted, interstitial markings could be accounted for by background parenchymal scarring, but the possibility of any superimposed CHF or interstitial infection would be difficult to exclude. No frank consolidation is identified. No gross left effusion.
