As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in right-sided pleural fluid. As a consequence, the interstitial structures at the right lung bases appear slightly denser than on the previous image. The heart continues to be moderately enlarged, with bilateral areas of atelectasis at the lung bases. In addition, a pre-existing left pleural effusion is unchanged in extent. No new parenchymal opacities.
