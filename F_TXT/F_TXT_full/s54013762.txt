Portable AP radiograph was compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier. Since the prior study, the patient has been intubated with the ET tube tip being approximately 5 cm above the carina. The right PICC line tip is in unchanged location at the level of mid SVC. The NG tube has been inserted terminating in the stomach. Multifocal consolidation seen on the prior radiograph appear to be unchanged in the left apex and potentially minimally improved at the right mid lung.
