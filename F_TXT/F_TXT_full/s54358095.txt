1. Stable postoperative contours to the right paramedian and hilar region in this patient status post esophagectomy. The nasogastric tube is unchanged in position. A right chest tube remains in place. The right pleural effusion has decreased in size. There is a residual patchy opacity at the right medial lung base which may represent an area of partial middle and/or lower lobe atelectasis. Also, patchy opacity at the left base is increased since the previous study, which could reflect worsening lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. Left-sided Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema.
