As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities appear denser than before and more widespread in distribution. This change, however, could be caused by the decrease in lung volume. Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No new parenchymal opacities. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
