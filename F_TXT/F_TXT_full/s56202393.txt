The heart size top normal enlarged when compared to ___ study. The mediastinal and pleural contours are unremarkable. A right lower lung opacity is seen suggestive of asymmetric pulmonary edema. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured from a small pleural effusion and volume loss of the left lower lobe secondary to atelectasis. Support devices are unchanged in position with the ETT terminating approximately 5.8 cm superior to the carina and the left jugular CVC terminating at the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax is seen.
