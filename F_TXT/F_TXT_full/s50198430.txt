The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with heart size appearing mildly enlarged. Low lung volumes persists with crowding of bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema. Atelectasis in the lung bases persists. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Cholecystectomy clips are demonstrated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Contrast from recent CT exam is seen within the collecting systems bilaterally.
