In comparison to previous radiograph from earlier the same date, a nasogastric tube is been placed, with tip directed cephalad in the fundus. Exam is otherwise remarkable for substantial improvement in right lower lobe atelectasis and apparent resolution of a small right pleural effusion, as well as apparent development of a new small left pleural effusion. Lung apices are excluded from the radiograph, limiting assessment for pneumothorax.
