1. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the soft tissues of the chest wall and neck. There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Bibasilar airspace opacities most likely represent atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. There is possibly a small left effusion. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Calcification in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. Several clips in the right upper quadrant are consistent with known cholecystectomy.
