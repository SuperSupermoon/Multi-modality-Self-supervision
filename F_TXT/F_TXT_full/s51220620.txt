No previous images. Endotracheal tube tip lies about 5 cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC. Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the side port is probably just above the cardioesophageal junction. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There are bilateral pulmonary opacifications, most prominent in the lower lungs bilaterally. In view of the normal cardiac silhouette, this could represent non-cardiogenic edema. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, multifocal pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
