Patient is rotated, distorting cardiomediastinal contours, but there does appear to be an increase in both moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal venous engorgement. Pulmonary vasculature is also more engorged, to the point of borderline edema and there is more atelectasis at the base of the right lung. No pneumothorax. Left central venous catheter ends in the upper SVC, right central venous infusion port ends in the upper right atrium, as before
