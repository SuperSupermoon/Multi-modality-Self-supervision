AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained on ___. The previously described Dobbhoff line remains in unchanged position, seen to terminate in the upper portion of the stomach. Significant elevation of the right diaphragm persists and is unchanged. Poor inspirational effort with high positioned diaphragms explains crowded position of pulmonary vasculature. There is a plate atelectasis now seen on the left lung base. No evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are present and no pneumothorax is seen in the apical area. A previously existing left subclavian central venous line has been removed.
