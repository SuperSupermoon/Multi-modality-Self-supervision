The heart is markedly enlarged, as seen on prior radiographs from ___. There is haziness of the hila with diffuse, but predominantly mid and lower lung heterogeneous opacities, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema, likely with both interstitial and alveolar components. The descending thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous, as before. There may be small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
