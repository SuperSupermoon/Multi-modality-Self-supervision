In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion. An area of more focal opacification is seen at the right base that obscures the right heart border and medial aspect of the hemidiaphragm. Although some of this could reflect crowding of engorged pulmonary vessels, the possibility of superimposed aspiration or infectious pneumonia cannot be excluded. Poor definition of the hemidiaphragms also suggests the presence of layering pleural effusions.
