Lung volumes are low resulting in vascular crowding. However, despite this, there is evidence of mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged despite the portable technique. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions. No focal consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. No pneumothorax is evident although the lung apices are obscured by overlying soft tissue.
