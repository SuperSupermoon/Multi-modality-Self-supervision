Moderate cardiomegaly is slightly worse than ___ years ago. Lung volumes are once again quite low, and there is more pronounced bibasilar consolidation which could be pneumonia, but is more likely atelectasis. The other region of consolidation superior to the right hilus has a similar differential diagnosis, but atelectasis is less likely in the nondependent lungs. Tip of the endotracheal tube at the upper margin of the clavicles is no less than 5 cm from the carina. The chin is elevated, so the position is probably functional. Small right pleural effusion is likely. No pneumothorax.
