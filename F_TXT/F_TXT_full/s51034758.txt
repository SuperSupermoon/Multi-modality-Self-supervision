Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 7 cm from the carina. Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC. Low lung volumes are present. Heart size appears moderately enlarged. The aortic knob is distinct with atherosclerotic calcifications noted. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour may be reflect underlying lymphadenopathy. Patchy and linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. There may be a small right pleural effusion, though no large pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. No displaced fracture is visualized.
