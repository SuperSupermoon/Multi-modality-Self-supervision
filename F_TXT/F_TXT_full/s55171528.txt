As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, notably on the right, have substantially decreased in extent and severity. No parenchymal opacities have newly occurred. The retrocardiac atelectasis that pre existed has completely resolved. Presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded but is unchanged as compared to the previous examination. No cardiomegaly, no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
