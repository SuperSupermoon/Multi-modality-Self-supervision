Compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Low lung volumes. The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. Minimal pulmonary edema. Deviation of the trachea to the left due to a mediastinal structure, presumably a goiter. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly. No pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumonia.
