In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been removed and replaced with a tracheostomy tube. The tip of the subclavian catheter is in the right atrium.

Bilateral pleural effusions I seen, more prominent on the right, with underlying compressive atelectasis. Moderate pulmonary edema is again seen. Given the extensive changes in the lungs due to vascular congestion and effusion, it would be extremely difficult to detect or exclude superimposed pneumonia.
