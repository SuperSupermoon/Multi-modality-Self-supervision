AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Left hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated. Irregular opacification at the base of the left lung is also longstanding finding. In the left lung projecting over the third anterior rib is a region of irregular peribronchial infiltration. This is the only finding to suggest active infection, a very small region indeed. Healed rib fractures are present at multiple levels in the right hemithorax. Mild cardiomegaly is chronic. The patient has longstanding tracheostomy. Fullness in the upper mediastinum is a function of mediastinal fat deposition and tortuous vessels and some enlarged lymph nodes as shown on the chest CT, ___, which also demonstrated severe upper tracheomalacia and chronic left lower lobe consolidation, presumably atelectasis.
