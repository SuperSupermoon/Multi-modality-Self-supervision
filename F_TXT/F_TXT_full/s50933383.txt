Endotracheal tube is noted in the region of right mainstem bronchus and retraction by 3.5 cm would be recommended for optimal positioning. The ET tube appears properly positioned on the followup radiograph at 9:31 am however and no adjustment is needed at this time. The heart appears moderately enlarged but stable. Mild bibasilar atelectasis is noted along with mild vascular congestion. Otherwise, the lungs are clear. Postsurgical changes are noted in the lower cervical spine. Known T8 vertebral body fracture is not well evaluated on this study.
