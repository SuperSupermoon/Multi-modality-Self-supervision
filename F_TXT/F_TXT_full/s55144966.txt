The cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is mild perihilar haziness with upper zone vascular redistribution and vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary edema. More focal ill-defined opacities within the lung bases could reflect aspiration. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
