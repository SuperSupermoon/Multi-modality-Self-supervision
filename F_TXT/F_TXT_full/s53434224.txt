1. A left subclavian Port-A-Cath continues to have its tip in the distal SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen unchanged in position within the neoesophagus. Heart remains enlarged. There is widening of the mediastinum, which likely is related to the neoesophagus and recent surgery. There is increasing patchy opacity at the right base, which may reflect increasing atelectasis, although aspiration or early pneumonia should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Right chest tube remains in place, and there is no appreciable pneumothorax. A focal area of sclerosis within the right humeral head most likely represents a bone island. Calcification contiguous to the greater tuberosity suggests remote trauma or chronic tendinitis. Clinical correlation is advised.
