AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 11:41 a.m. The patient was extubated in the meantime interval. The Swan-Ganz catheter inserted through the right internal jugular approach terminates at the level of the right ventricle outflow tract. Cardiac silhouette is stable. Substantial amount of pneumopericardium is present. There is interval substantial improvement up to almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema. Left retrocardiac opacity is persistent, consistent with atelectasis. Small amount of pleural effusion is seen, decreased since the prior study. No evidence of pneumothorax is present. Although the left retrocardiac opacity might reflect loculated hemothorax, the lack of interval increase in overall amount of pleural effusion makes it less likely.
