Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.8 cm above level the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the stomach. Bilateral perihilar opacities are worrisome for pulmonary edema. Overall increase in opacity projecting over the right hemi thorax as compared to the left could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, underlying consolidation, less likely layering pleural effusion. Subtle left basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis. Component of bibasilar aspiration not excluded. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.
