Single portable view of the chest. There is increased opacity in the right lung, particularly projecting over the base. Right lung base nodule is less well seen on the current exam, potentially projectional, and adequate comparison for interval change is not possible on this exam. Post-radiation changes are again seen in the right paratracheal region. There is also subtle opacity at the left lung base in the retrocardiac region. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No acute osseous abnormalities identified. Bridging of the posterior right ___ and 7th ribs are again seen.
