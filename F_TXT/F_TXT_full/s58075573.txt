The heart size remains mildly enlarged. Aorta is tortuous and calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, and the pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Lung volumes are low which causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Patchy atelectasis in the left lung base is noted. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures.
