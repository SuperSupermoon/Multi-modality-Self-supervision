There is some decrease in the opacifications described on the previous study. The presence of Kerley B lines again suggests some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, though there is no evidence of enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusion is identified. There again are vague areas of more consolidative opacification that could represent some resolving areas of pneumonia.
