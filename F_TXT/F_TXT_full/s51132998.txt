1. Dual-lead left-sided pacer is again seen. There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central line which has its tip in the proximal SVC. The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable postoperative appearance to the cardiac and mediastinal contours. There are layering bilateral effusions with associated bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. A more elliptical opacity in the right mid lung likely represents loculated fluid within the horizontal fissure. There is suggestion of superimposed mild interstitial edema on the current examination. No pneumothorax is seen.
