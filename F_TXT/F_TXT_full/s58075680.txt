AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: A remnant dual transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead is curled in the left axilla. A right pacer defibrillator lead follows a normal course from the right axillary pacemaker to right ventricular apex. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart is moderately enlarged. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is of uncertain chronicity, could indicate diaphragmatic dysfunction. Lungs are clear. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion, no mediastinal widening.
