AP chest compared to ___ at 11:06 p.m. Two pleural tubes unchanged in position, both impinging on the midline, one at the level of the left upper lobe bronchus, the other at the level of the diaphragm. No large pneumothorax, but small volume of pleural air could be missed in non-erect positioning. Moderate right pleural effusion collected in the upper hemithorax, unchanged. The large and irregularly-shaped thoracic aortic contour, stable since the earlier postoperative film, devoid of the intra-aortic graft present preoperatively, could ___ hemorrhage, which would explain right pleural or extrapleural fluid. Lungs grossly clear aside from right basal atelectasis. Severe pneumoperitoneum could be larger. Heart size normal. ET tube in standard placement. Swan-Ganz catheter tip projects over the pulmonary outflow tract, below the pulmonary artery. Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall is extensive.
