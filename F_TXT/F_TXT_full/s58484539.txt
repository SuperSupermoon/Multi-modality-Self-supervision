Single supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. A left arm PICC line is seen with its tip in the mid SVC. NG tube courses inferiorly along the thoracic midline extending into the left upper quadrant. The heart appears mildly enlarged. Lower lobe opacities likely reflect atelectasis. The mid to upper lungs appear well aerated. The mediastinal contour is widened, though this is likely due to position. The bony structures are intact.
