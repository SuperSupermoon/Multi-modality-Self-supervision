As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The low lung volumes continue to be low. Status post CABG with unremarkable alignment of the sternal wires. Moderate left pleural effusion and bilateral areas of atelectasis, but no new parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia. Minimal fluid overload is present in unchanged manner.
