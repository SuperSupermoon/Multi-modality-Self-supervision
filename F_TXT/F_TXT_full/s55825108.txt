The ET tube is possibly at the thoracic inlet, approximately 8 cm above the carina and should be further advanced 2 to 5 cm. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Minimal opacification in bilateral lungs, right greater than left, may represent mild asymmetric pulmonary edema. Mild opacification at the right lung base may represent dependent atelectasis versus aspiration. No definite rib fractures are identified; however, if there is continued clinical concern for rib fractures then dedicated views can be obtained. Opacification in the right upper lobe is noted, attention on follow up imaging is recommended. Dr. ___ was notified of the result at 11:15 a.m. on ___ via telephone.
