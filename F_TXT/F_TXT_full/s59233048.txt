Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Slight worsening of predominantly right-sided diffuse airspace consolidation with sparing of the lung periphery, now accompanied by left perihilar haziness and scattered interstitial opacities. Differential diagnosis includes asymmetrical pulmonary edema and a diffuse aspiration pneumonia in the right lung coexisting with edema. Moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged, but there has been slight improvement in adjacent left retrocardiac opacity. No pneumothorax.
