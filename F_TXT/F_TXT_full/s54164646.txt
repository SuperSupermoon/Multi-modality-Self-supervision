1. Feeding tube remains in place coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There has been interval placement of a right basilar chest tube. The moderate-sized right pneumothorax has slightly decreased in size, although there still is a significant anterior component in the costophrenic sulcus. Multiple right-sided rib fractures are again seen. A trace amount of air is seen within the right lateral chest wall soft tissues. There is increasing indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature, left greater than right, which may reflect asymmetric interstitial edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Probable small layering left effusion with retrocardiac opacification which may represent compressive atelectasis.
