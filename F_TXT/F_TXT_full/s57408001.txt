Compared to the prior radiograph performed 1.5 hours prior the moderate to large right pleural effusion is relatively unchanged in size allowing for differences in technique. A trace left pleural effusion is again identified. No pneumothorax is seen. There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema. The mediastinal and cardiac contours are stable. A left pacer, median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are unchanged.
