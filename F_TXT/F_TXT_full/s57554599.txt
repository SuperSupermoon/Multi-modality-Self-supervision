There has been interval intubation with the endotracheal tube slightly low lying, terminating approximately 2.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube and side port are within the stomach. A left chest tube is demonstrated which appears kinked within its distal aspect, and tip overlies the left mid mediastinal border. New subcutaneous emphysema seen within the left lateral chest wall. Small left-sided pneumothorax is similar to prior studies with calcified scarring noted at the left apex. There is worsening aeration of the left lung base compared to the prior chest radiograph, likely reflective of combination of atelectasis and known pleural effusion. Multiple left-sided rib fractures are again noted.
