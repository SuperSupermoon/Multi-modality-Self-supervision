Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube in appropriate position, terminating 6 cm above the level of the carina. An NG tube is also seen coursing through the esophagus, into the stomach, and out of view. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. A small amount of opacification in the left lung base likely represents aspiration. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
