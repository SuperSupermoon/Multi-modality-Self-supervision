The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. There is a mild increase in the moderate-sized right pleural effusion, with decreased aeration of the right lower lobe. Heterogeneous opacification in the retrocardiac left lung base, likely represents atelectasis. No new consolidation is detected. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists.
