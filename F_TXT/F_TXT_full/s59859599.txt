Right PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC. Patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and left-sided pacemaker placement with leads in unchanged positions. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is markedly enlarged, unchanged. The aorta remains unfolded. There is mild pulmonary edema, not substantially changed in the interval, with small to moderate size right and probable trace left pleural effusions. The pleural effusions overall are likely unchanged in size. No pneumothorax is present. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.
