Patient is rotated somewhat to the right. Overall, the appearance of the right chest is similar to prior. Large area of right perihilar, right upper to right mid lung opacity with mass like opacity at the level of the right hilum, grossly stable. There is again seen a volume loss of the right lower lung. There appears to be subtle increase in now left perihilar and left infrahilar/basilar streaky opacity which may relate to volume overload however, infectious process, aspiration, or other disease spread not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen on the left although a trace left pleural effusion be difficult to exclude. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given that the right aspect is obscured by right hemithorax opacity.
