Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes resultant bronchovascular crowding. As before, there is a large right-sided pleural effusion and a small left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis at both bases. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The endotracheal tube ends 5.5 cm from the carina. A left-sided internal jugular central venous line ends in the origin of the SVC. The nasogastric tube courses into the stomach with the last side port just below the GE junction. There is no pneumothorax.
