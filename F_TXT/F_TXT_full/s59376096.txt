There has been interval placement of a left pleural pigtail catheter with interval decrease in size of the left pleural effusion which now occupies approximately half of the area of the left hemithorax. There is interval resolution of rightward mediastinal shift. Small right pleural effusion persists. Subtle opacity of the right lower lung field persists. Aortic knob calcification is again noted. Evaluation of heart size is limited in the setting of overlying pleural effusion. There is decreased downward displacement of the gastric bubble.
