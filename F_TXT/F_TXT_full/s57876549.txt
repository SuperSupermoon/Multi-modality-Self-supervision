A new confluent opacity has developed in the right retrocardiac region, partially obscuring the right hemidiaphragm contour medially. There is also a subtle new area of opacity at the left base. Considering clinical concern for aspiration, these findings could represent acute aspiration event. Lungs are otherwise clear except for a questionable small 1-cm nodular opacity overlying the ninth left posterior rib level. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for slight patient rotation.
