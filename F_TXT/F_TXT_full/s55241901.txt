In comparison with the study of ___, the left subclavian PICC line tip extends to the mid portion of the SVC. Dobhoff tube extends at least to the upper stomach, where it passes the lower margin of the image. Persistent airspace opacity in the right upper zone. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. No definite pleural effusion on this side. On the left, there is increased opacification at the base with blunting of the costophrenic angle. This is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural fluid. Right chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
