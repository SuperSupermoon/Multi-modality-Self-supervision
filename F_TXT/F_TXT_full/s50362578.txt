Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.7 cm above the level of the carina. There are relatively low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities are seen, which could be due to aspiration and/or infection. No large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. There is no overt pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. The patient is rotated slightly to the left.
