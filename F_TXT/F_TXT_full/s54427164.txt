Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is noted. Mediastinal contour is grossly unremarkable. Lung volumes are low. There is mild pulmonary edema demonstrated with peribronchial cuffing and vascular indistinctness. Patchy opacities in the lung bases as well as within the periphery of both lungs may reflect an underlying mild chronic interstitial lung disease with superimposed patchy atelectasis at the lung bases, but infection is not excluded. There may be a small bilateral pleural effusions, but no pneumothorax is detected. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
