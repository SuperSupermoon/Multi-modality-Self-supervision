AP chest compared to ___: Left PIC line passes only as far as the rib cage, the tip is not tapered, and this could be due to line fracture. If this is clinically realistic possibility, detection of an embolized fragment would require at least conventional chest radiographs. The lungs are clear. The heart size is normal. Thoracic aorta mildly enlarged generally but not focally aneurysmal. No pleural abnormality. Dr. ___ discussed the findings at 9:15 a.m. on ___. Calcified lymph node projects over the right upper trachea, chronic finding, unlikely to have active clinical significance.
