Widespread areas of consolidation are present, and previously only involved the lower lobes. Considering rapid progression, co-existent septal lines in the lower lobes, and accompanying widening of the vascular pedicle, these findings could reflect rapidly progressive pulmonary edema from clinically suspected volume overload. Massive aspiration could produce a similar appearance of rapidly progressive airspace disease. Bilateral small pleural effusions are also demonstrated, but there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
