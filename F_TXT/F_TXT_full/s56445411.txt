A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device appears in unchanged. The heart is probably normal in size but not well imaged because of overlapping opacities. The aortic arch appears calcified. In the right lung, there is diffuse mild opacification that is confluent near the base of the lung with layering opacity suggesting a substantial pleural effusion is likely present. Increased interstitial opacification is also noted along the right mid-to-lower lung. In the left lung, mostly aeration is good in the mid to upper lungs, but at the left lung base, there is also confluent retrocardiac opacity. No definite pleural effusion is seen on the left side.
