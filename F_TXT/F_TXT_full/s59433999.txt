AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. There is status post sternotomy and the presence of multiple surgical clips in the left mediastinal structures are indicative of previous bypass surgery. A permanent pacer is identified in left anterior axillary position seen to be connected to two intracavitary electrodes with termination points compatible with right atrial appendage and apical portion of right ventricle correspondingly. There is mild cardiac enlargement but no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion is seen and the lateral pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation. No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area.
