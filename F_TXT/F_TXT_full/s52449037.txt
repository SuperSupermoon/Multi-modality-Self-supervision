CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 8:01 a.m. no significant change is detected. ET tube and NG tube in satisfactory position. Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlies the right pulmonary artery -- clinical correlation regarding retraction is requested, as this lies relatively distal.Linear opacity overlying the proximal portion of the descending aorta likely reflects the presence of a balloon pump, in satisfactory position. There are low-inspiratory volumes. Allowing for this, there is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is pulmonary vascular plethora, but no overt CHF or gross effusion.
