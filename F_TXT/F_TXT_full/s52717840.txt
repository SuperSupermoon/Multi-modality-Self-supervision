In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a Dobbhoff tube that extends to the lower body of the stomach. The central catheters remain in place. The area of increased opacification at the right base is no longer identified. This could indicate clearing of layering pleural effusion, though it could also be due to a more erect position of the patient. No evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
