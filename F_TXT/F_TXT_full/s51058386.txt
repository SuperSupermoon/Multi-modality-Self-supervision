In comparison to the previous study of earlier the same date, previously present complete right lung collapse has partially improved, with better aeration of the right upper lobe and part of the right middle lobe, with substantial atelectasis remaining in the right lower and middle lobes. Although the right upper lobe is mostly re-expanded, note is made of airspace consolidation at the apex. Additionally, a new confluent opacity has developed in the left mid and lower lung, which is probably a combination of atelectasis/consolidation and pleural effusion.
