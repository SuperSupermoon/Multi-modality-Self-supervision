There is evidence of prior cardiac surgery seen by mediastinal surgical clips and median sternotomy wires. The heart is moderately enlarged and lung volumes are decreased. Pulmonary vascular and central venous congestion is noted. Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis or pneumonia. No large pleural effusion. The trachea is mildly deviated towards the right and narrowed, which may be secondary to chronic lung disease and displacement from the aorta, however displacement from a mediastinal mass is a possibility.
