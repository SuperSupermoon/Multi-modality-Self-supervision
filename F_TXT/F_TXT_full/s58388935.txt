There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube which is low lying, with tip terminating approximately 2.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube has been placed, coursing below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach, and tip off the inferior borders of the film. There is continued re- demonstration of moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema, moderate in degree and slightly worse in the interval. Retrocardiac opacity persists, and again may reflect atelectasis. A trace left pleural effusion may be present. No pneumothorax.
