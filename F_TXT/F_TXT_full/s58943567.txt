1) Interval removal of left chest tube. Some focal density at the previous site of the chest tube suggests some local contusion/hematoma. 2) Possibility of a small pneumothorax along the medial aspect of the left lung cannot be excluded, but no definitive pneumothorax is identified. If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help to better define the presence of a non-apical pneumothorax. 3) Slight increase in patchy opacity at right base. No gross effusion.
