AP chest compared to ___: The heart is moderately enlarged, but pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no pleural effusion. Nodular contour of the right hilus conforms to the appearance on chest CT ___ and ___. There may be enlarged lymph nodes in the right hilus, but the absence of change over the course of a year indicates a benign explanation. Hiatus hernia is difficult to appreciate on this conventional radiograph, but explains vague opacity projecting to the right of the midline over the cardiophrenic sulcus. The right jugular line ends in upper-to-mid SVC. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
