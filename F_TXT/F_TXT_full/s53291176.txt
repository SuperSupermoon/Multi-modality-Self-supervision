Evaluation of the radiograph is limited due to patient position. Within this limitation, portable chest radiograph demonstrates endotracheal tube terminating 4 cm above the carina. Enteric catheter courses below the left hemidiaphragm and out of view. There is increased bilateral opacifications, particularly in the mid and lower aspects of the lungs with an ill-defined ovoid opacification projecting over the right mid lung. Findings likely represent a combination of atelectasis, small bilateral pleural effusions and worsening pulmonary edema; however, multifocal pneumonia is a consideration in the appropriate clinical setting. The ovoid opacification in right mid lung may reflect pleural fluid within the fissure. Cardiomediastinal borders are difficult to assess due to lung volumes and opacification; however there is at least moderate cardiac enlargement.
