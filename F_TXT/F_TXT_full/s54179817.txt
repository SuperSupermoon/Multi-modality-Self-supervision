Cardiomegaly is accentuated by the projection. Left lower lobe opacity has increased due to almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe. Right lower lobe opacities have also increased consistent with marked worsening of right lower lobe atelectasis. Otherwise bilateral extensive consolidations are grossly unchanged.

ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
