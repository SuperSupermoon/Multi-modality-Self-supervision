1. Interval removal of the left chest tube. No evidence of pneumothorax. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction, unchanged. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with some adjacent streaky opacities, suggestive of atelectasis. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a small effusion. There is also possibly a tiny right pleural effusion. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
