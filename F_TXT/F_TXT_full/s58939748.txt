1. Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. Right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the distal SVC unchanged. Left basilar chest tube remains in place. There is a stable small to moderate left apicolateral pneumothorax. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle persists and may reflect some layering pleural effusion with some associated patchy left basilar airspace opacity consistent with compressive atelectasis. The right lung is grossly clear. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.
