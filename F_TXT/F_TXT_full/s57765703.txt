Portable AP chest radiograph is obtained with the patient in the semi-erect position. Tracheostomy noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged; bulging of the pulmonary outflow tract reflects enlargement of pulmonary arteries and suggests underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pulmonary edema has slightly improved compared to the prior study. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Again bibasilar opacifications are noted and are suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation.
