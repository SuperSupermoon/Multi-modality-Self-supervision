Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 3:16 p.m. The tracheostomy tip is at the midline, 4 cm above the carina. The right subclavian line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. There is evidence of pneumoperitoneum, consistent with history of recent PEG placement. Lungs are essentially clear with no interval development of consolidation or interstitial edema demonstrated.
