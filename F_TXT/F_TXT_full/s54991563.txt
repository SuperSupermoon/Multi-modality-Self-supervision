AP chest compared to ___ and ___, the first postoperative chest radiograph: Mild interstitial edema is new. Opacification at the base of the right lung could be atelectasis, but should be followed closely to exclude aspiration pneumonia. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. No appreciable paraspinal hematoma in the chest. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube can be traced only as far as the low esophagus, beyond which its course is obscured by spinal hardware. The stomach is at least moderately distended with gas and the effectiveness of the nasogastric tube needs to be evaluated. Dr. ___ was paged at 9:10 a.m. to discuss these findings.
