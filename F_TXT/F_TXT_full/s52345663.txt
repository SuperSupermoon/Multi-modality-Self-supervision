A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates the endotracheal tube with the tip 4.5 cm above the carina, a left subclavian catheter with the tip in the mid SVC, and a nasogastric tube extending into the stomach. Lung volumes are low and there are persistent bibasilar consolidations, right greater than left, which are improved minimally since ___ and likely represent pneumonia. A small left pleural effusion is new. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and there is no pneumothorax.
