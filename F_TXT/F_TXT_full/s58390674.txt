Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a right-sided PICC line with the tip at least in the superior SVC, although the course of the catheter cannot be followed beyond that point due to overlying pacemaker leads. The tip is not within the right atrium. If a precise location of the catheter tip is desired, oblique views could be considered, although these still may not provide the answer given that the PICC line and the pacemaker leads are within the same vessel. Again seen are large bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectatic changes. There is some improved lung volume over previous exam, but there is persistent elevated pulmonary vascular pressure. There is no pneumothorax or other complication seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
