The pulmonary opacities extending from the suprahilar region on the right corresponding to the mass and associated parenchymal abnormalities on the recent CT are again present. The left lung is essentially clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion.
