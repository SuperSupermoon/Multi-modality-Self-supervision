In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter has been removed. Left subclavian catheter again extends to the lower portion of the SVC. Continued increased opacification in the retrocardiac region with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Small effusion is seen on the right with some atelectatic changes at the bases. Right chest tube is in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. In view of the extensive parenchymal changes, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
