CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. There are low inspiratory volumes. Allowing for this, the heart is not enlarged, though there is a slight left ventricular configuration. The aorta is slightly unfolded. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Minimal atelectasis at both bases. No frank consolidation and no effusion. Incidental note is made of the inferior portion of fixation hardware in the lower cervical spine and a small calcification adjacent to the right humeral head, which likely represents hydroxyapatite/calcific tendinitis. Possible very mild right convex curvature centered in the mid/lower thoracic spine.
