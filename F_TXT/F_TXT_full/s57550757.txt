There is no evidence of an acute, displaced rib fracture on this portable radiograph, but note that portable radiographs are relatively insensitive for detecting acute rib fractures. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is evident. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Lobulated lingular nodule appears similar to the prior radiograph. Additional small nodular opacities are seen to better detail on recent CT of the chest. A more confluent opacity in left retrocardiac region may reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, but followup radiograph may be helpful to exclude an infectious pneumonia in this area in the appropriate clinical setting.
