A left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus. The heart size is difficult to assess given the presence of bilateral pleural effusions, but is likely mildly enlarged. Tracheostomy tube remains in unchanged position. Mild pulmonary edema is similar compared to the prior study, but increasing bilateral pleural effusions are noted, moderate to large on the right, and small on the left. Dense opacification in both lung bases likely reflect atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax is identified.
