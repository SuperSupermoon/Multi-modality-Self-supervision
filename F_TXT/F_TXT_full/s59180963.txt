Vague opacification projects over the right lower lung at the level of the 6 through 8 anterior ribs, and at the level of the right second anterior interspace, and on the left lateral to the cardiac apex. I would recommend confirming these abnormalities with conventional chest radiographs when feasible, but they may be due to early atypical pneumonia. Heart is normal size. There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. Left PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
