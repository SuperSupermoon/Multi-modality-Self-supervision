Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. New, mild right lower lobe atelectasis. Increased indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature is consistent with new, mild pulmonary edema. Small, new right pleural effusion. Interval elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with increased retrocardiac opacity suggests left basilar atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Pulmonary nodules are not well appreciated radiographically. Recommend repeat chest CT for follow-up of pulmonary nodules.
