1. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There are persistent low lung volumes with more focal airspace opacities in the right upper lobe and the right lateral lower lung and more diffuse airspace process throughout the left lung. These findings could represent areas of aspiration or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. A more focal nodular opacity at the right upper lung contiguous to the first costochondral joint is felt to likely be degenerative in etiology. No pneumothorax is seen. No pleural effusions.
