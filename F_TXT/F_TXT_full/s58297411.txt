Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomegaly is stable. Widened mediastinum is unchanged. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity is unchanged, most likely atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded. The right lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusion. ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carina. Left subclavian catheter is in standard position
