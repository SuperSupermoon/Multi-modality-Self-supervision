As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight improvement of the bilateral basal parenchymal opacities. Bilateral pleural effusions are still seen. Mild retrocardiac atelectasis. The opacity in the right upper lobe, described on the previous examination, no projects over the anterior aspect of the right first rib. As recommended, CT should be performed to exclude the potential for a neoplastic lesion.
