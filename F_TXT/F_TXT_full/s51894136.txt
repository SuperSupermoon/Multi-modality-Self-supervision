AP chest compared to ___, at 10:59 a.m., read in conjunction with a chest CTA, 6:48 p.m. on ___. The upper lobe component of severe mass-like consolidation is unchanged, lower lung component has improved over 36 hours. Findings are consistent with at least some of the abnormality in the right lung, being due to pneumonia. Since we do not have chest radiographs following an even more serious doubt of right lung consolidation in ___, I cannot tell how much of the current findings are residual, how much is new, nor can we determine the time course. That would be necessary to determine if there is any residual or recurrent tumor in the right lung. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Left lung is clear. There is no appreciable pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
