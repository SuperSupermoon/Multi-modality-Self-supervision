Heart is smaller, now normal size, but consolidation at the right lung base has worsened. This is therefore likely to be pneumonia, rather than asymmetric pulmonary edema. Pulmonary vascular congestion in the upper lobes persists. Pleural effusion is small if any. ET tube and bilateral jugular central venous lines are in standard placements. No pneumothorax.
