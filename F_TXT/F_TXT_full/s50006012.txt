1. A dual-lead left-sided pacer remains in place. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. An endotracheal tube remains in place with its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There are persistent streaky opacities at the left base most likely reflecting atelectasis. There is possibly a small associated layering left effusion. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. When compared to the previous study, the opacity at the left base is not significantly changed favoring atelectasis, although an early infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. Clinical correlation is advised.
