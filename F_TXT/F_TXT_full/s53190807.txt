No PICC is seen. The lungs are hyperinflated, suggestive of COPD. Retrocardiac opacity is seen, which may represent atelectasis but cannot exclude infection in the right clinical setting. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. A partially imaged catheter is seen overlying the left upper quadrant.
