Compared with the prior film, a new right IJ central line is present, tip overlying distal SVC. There is a relative paucity of vascular markings at the both lung apices -- this likely represents normal variation in this individual. No line of demarcation to suggest a pneumothorax is detected. Again seen is the somewhat rounded focal opacity in the right upper lobe laterally, consistent with full consolidation, with minimal atelectasis at the right and left lung bases. No new focal infiltrate and no effusion is detected. No CHF.
