New extensive opacification of bilateral lung fields is most consistent with severe pulmonary edema. Areas of nodularity in the left upper lung and right lung base may represent a superimposed infectious process or large pulmonary nodules, as seen on recent abdomen pelvis CT. Repeat chest radiographs or chest CT following diuresis are recommended for further evaluation. Numerous support devices include an enteric tube terminating within the stomach, a prostatic mitral valve, 8 intact median sternotomy wires, and multiple mediastinal clips.
