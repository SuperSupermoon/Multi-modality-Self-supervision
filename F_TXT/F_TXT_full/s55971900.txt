Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.4 cm above the level of the carina. A right sided venous catheter again terminates in the right axilla. The lungs remain hyperinflated. There is improved aeration of the right lung with interval decrease in right sided pulmonary opacities. Left-sided pulmonary opacities also appear improved with persistent left base opacity.
