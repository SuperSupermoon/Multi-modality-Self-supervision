Moderate left pleural effusion continues to increase despite the left basal chest tube, and most the left lung is collapsed. If this radiograph was performed with the patient erect, the absence of a fluid level in the left hemi thorax would exclude hydro pneumothorax responsible for the hyperlucency in the left upper chest. Presumably this is a hyperinflated lower lobe superior segment. The mediastinum is still shifted leftward, and the heart is large, but I cannot say however it has changed because the left heart border is obscured by pleural fluid. Right lung is clear.
