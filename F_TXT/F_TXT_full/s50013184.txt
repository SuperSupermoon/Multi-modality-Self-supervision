In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to at least the mid body of the stomach, were crosses the margin of the image. The side-port is clearly beyond the esophagogastric junction. Bibasilar opacifications are consistent with pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, more prominent on the right. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
