A pacer/defibrillator unit projects over the left chest with a lead terminating in the right ventricle. The heart size is mildly enlarged, although this may be exaggerated by AP technique. The mediastinal contours demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aortic knob. The hilar contours demonstrate mild vascular engorgement. The lungs also demonstrate widespread hazy opacity, compatible with pulmonary edema. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Degenerative changes are present in the bilateral glenohumeral joints.
