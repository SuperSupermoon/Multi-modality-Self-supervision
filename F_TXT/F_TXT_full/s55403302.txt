Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. Port-A-Cath resides over the right chest wall with catheter tip extending into the expected location of the superior vena cava. The lungs are clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion, or signs of pneumothorax. Upper lobe lucency is compatible with known emphysema. The heart and mediastinal contours appear normal. Bony structures are intact. There are old right rib cage deformities again noted.
