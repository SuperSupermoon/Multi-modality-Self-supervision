Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of a right-sided large-bore central venous catheter which terminates in the right atrium. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is stable prominence of the perihilar vasculature which may be due to vascular congestion as well as bibasilar opacities which could relate to atelectasis and scarring, underlying infection or aspiration is not excluded. Old right-sided rib fractures are again seen.
