Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. The heart is mildly enlarged and the aorta is unfolded though overall appearance is unchanged. There are no overt signs of pulmonary edema. There is mild retrocardiac opacity which could represent left lower lobe atelectasis though given underpenetrated technique, evaluation is limited. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax. Clips are noted in the right neck, again similar to prior exam. Bony structures are intact.
