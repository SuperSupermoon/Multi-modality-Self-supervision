AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained five hours earlier during the same day. Status post sternotomy, previous bypass surgery and moderate cardiac enlargement, appear unchanged. Comparison of the pulmonary vasculature clearly identifies a more marked vascular plethora that has developed during the latest examination interval of less than five hours. There is a degree of perivascular haze suggestive of some beginning interstitial edema. The lateral pleural sinuses remain grossly free. No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. Review of previous chest examinations including a chest CT dated ___ indicates that the patient had multiple parenchymal densities on the lung bases, as shown on previous CT. There was no evidence of new masses or discrete pneumonic processes.
