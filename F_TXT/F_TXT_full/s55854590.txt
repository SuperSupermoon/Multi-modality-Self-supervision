A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained. Bilateral opacities, with a prominent perihilar distribution are most consistent with moderate to severe pulmonary edema. Thickening of the minor fissure is also noted. Increased opacification at the right costophrenic angles probably relates to pulmonary interstitial edema, but should be re-evaluated once the edema is resolved. Heart appears is moderately enlarged. A small left pleural effusion is possible. There is no focal consolidation. There is no pneumothorax.
