Large left pneumothorax is associated with near-complete collapse of the left lung, and the clinical team has already placed a left chest tube to treat this finding by the time of this dictation on ___ (see separately dictated post-chest tube placement radiograph under clip ___). Cardiomediastinal contours are similar to the recent post-operative radiograph. Prominent midsternal lucency could be a normal post-operative finding or could reflect sternal dehiscence in this patient with recent sternotomy. Widespread subcutaneous emphysema has worsened since the recent radiograph. Small pleural effusions are present, left greater than right.
