Hardware is seen overlying the mid to lower cervical spine. Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are stable. There is improved aeration at the left base with resolution of the previously seen patchy opacities. No large effusions are present. Patchy opacity at the right base is now seen likely reflecting atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded. The pulmonary vasculature is prominent but no overt edema is seen. Left hilar fullness is consistent with known mass seen on recent CT dated ___. No pneumothorax. Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube.
