A supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrate the endotracheal tube with the tip in the mid thoracic trachea. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal, though slightly prominent secondary to lower lung volumes. There is no focal consolidation, obvious pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Multiple rib fractures are better evaluated on CT torso from the same day. Contrast is seen within the bilateral renal collecting systems.
