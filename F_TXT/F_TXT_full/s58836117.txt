AP portable supine view of the chest. An endotracheal tube is seen terminating 2.6 cm above the carina. The endogastric tube descends into the left upper abdomen. Lung volumes are low though allowing for this, there is no evidence of pneumonia or edema. There is mild right basal atelectasis. No supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size appears within normal limits. The mediastinal contour appears grossly unremarkable. The hila appear slightly congested. Bony structures are intact.
