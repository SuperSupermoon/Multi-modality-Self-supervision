Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a right-sided IJ central catheter in place with the tip apparently in adequate position in the SVC, provided there is adequate draw back clinically. There is no pneumothorax or other complication seen. Atelectasis is seen at the left lung base. There is no pleural effusion. There is substantial right perihilar post-surgical changes which makes differentiating mediastinal tissues difficult. The heart appears to be of normal size. Subcutaneous gas is visualized along the right side of the body up to the neck.
