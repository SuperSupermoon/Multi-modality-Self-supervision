In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube is in the supraclavicular region, approximately 11 cm above the carina. There is increasing opacification at the left base. Although this could represent atelectasis, the coalescent appearance raises the possibility of superimposed pneumonia. At the right base, there is continued opacification consistent with pleural fluid and underlying compressive atelectasis. There is the suggestion of a loculated area of pneumothorax at the right base laterally. However, this could be an artifact produced by overlying pectoral tissues.
