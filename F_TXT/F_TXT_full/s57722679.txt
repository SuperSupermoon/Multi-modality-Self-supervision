Exam is limited by marked leftward patient rotation. Near-complete opacification of left hemithorax is difficult to fully assess due to patient rotation, but is probably due to a combination of enlarging, now moderate-to-large left pleural effusion as well as a combination of atelectasis and consolidation in the left lung. Repeat non-rotated radiograph would be helpful for more complete evaluation. Previously reported pulmonary edema has similar appearance in the right lung, but may have slightly worsened in the left lung. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. Tracheal narrowing at the thoracic inlet level is similar to recent radiograph and is in keeping with known thyroid enlargement on prior CT of ___.
