Patchy left base opacity is seen which may be due to infection or aspiration. No definite focal consolidation is seen on the right. Subtle obscuration of the bilateral costophrenic angles may be due to overlying soft tissue although trace pleural effusions are difficult to entirely exclude. There is minimal vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
