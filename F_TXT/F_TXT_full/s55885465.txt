1. Tracheostomy tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. A feeding tube remains in position with its tip coursing below the diaphragm and not identified. A right pleural pigtail catheter remains in place. There continues to be extensive right lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema. Lungs remain hyperinflated with parenchymal distortion consistent with underlying emphysema. The small-to-moderate right apical lateral pneumothorax is likely unchanged given differences in patient positioning. There are possibly small bilateral effusions. A more rounded opacity at the right medial lung base is unchanged. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
