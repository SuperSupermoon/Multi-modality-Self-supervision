Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. Right chest tube is present with it tip terminating near the right lung apex. On concurrent review of chest CT dated ___, tiny right apical pneumothorax demonstrated on this x-ray is infact very small than what it appears. Due to rotation of the patient, reliable comparison for interval changes in the lung including bibasal lung opacities was limited; however, within the limitations, increased volume loss at right lung base can be appreciated. Mild bilateral pleural effusions are overall unchanged.
