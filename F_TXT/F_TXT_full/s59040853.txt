The previously described radiopaque foreign body is no longer visualized; however, there has been an increased amount of opacity in the right lower lobe consistent with volume loss/infiltrate. There is minimal pulmonary vascular re-distribution. Clips in the left upper quadrant are again seen. There is a small left pleural effusion.
