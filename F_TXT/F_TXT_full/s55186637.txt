AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided. The heart is mildly enlarged. Lung volumes are low which limits evaluation. There is subtle haziness in the right lower lung which could represent underpenetrated technique, though the possibility of a partially layering right effusion is not excluded. There is no pneumothorax. The left lung appears clear. Bony structures appear intact. Clips are noted in the superior mediastinum, unchanged. There is a calcified rounded structure again noted in the right upper quadrant compatible with hepatic lesion.
