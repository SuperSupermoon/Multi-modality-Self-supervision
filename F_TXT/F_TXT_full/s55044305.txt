Low lung volumes are present. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, with mild pulmonary vascular congestion again noted, similar compared to the prior exam. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis but infection is difficult to exclude. Right mid lung field peripheral opacity appears unchanged compared to the prior study and is nonspecific, potentially an area of infection. No pneumothorax is detected. Multiple calcified gallstones are again seen within the right upper quadrant the abdomen.
