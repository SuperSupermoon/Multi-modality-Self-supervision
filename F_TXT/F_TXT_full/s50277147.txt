In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube has been pulled back so that the tip lies approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube has been repositioned so that it no longer coils in the upper thoracic region and now extends to the upper stomach, the of the side-port probably remains above the cardioesophageal junction. The bilateral pulmonary opacification is continued to decrease.
