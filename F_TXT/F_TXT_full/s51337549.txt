Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. There is closure of the right CP angle limit evaluation. An external defibrillator pad projects over the left lower chest wall. An endotracheal tube is seen along the upper thoracic midline with its tip residing approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. Advancement by approximately 1-2 cm would result in more optimal positioning. The NG tube courses into the left upper quadrant. Lung volumes are low though no large consolidation or supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The heart appears normal in size. No bony abnormalities are seen.
