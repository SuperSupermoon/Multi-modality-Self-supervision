A right internal jugular catheter and right-sided PICC are unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study. Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion persists. The previously demonstrated bilateral airspace opacities are slightly improved, suggesting resolving pulmonary edema. Linear atelectasis in the left mid lung. Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. There is likely a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax seen.
