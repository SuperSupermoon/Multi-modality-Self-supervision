Study somewhat limited by lordotic positioning and the patient's chin obscuring assessment of the lung apices. Low lung volumes are present. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely within normal limits. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted as a result of low lung volumes. No overt pulmonary edema is seen though mild pulmonary vascular congestion is not excluded. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities which are more pronounced in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis. Infection is not excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Multilevel degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.
