As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The endotracheal tube is low and should be pulled back by approximately 1 cm, as it is almost at the level of the carina. The nasogastric tube is unchanged. Coiling in the stomach is still noted. In the interval, the patient has undergone surgery, as documented by a staple line projecting over the midline. The lung volumes have minimally decreased, the elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with subsequent areas of atelectasis, however, is unchanged. Unremarkable right lung.
