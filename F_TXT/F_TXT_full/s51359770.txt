Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is patchy right upper lobe opacity, is similar to priors and may relate to chronic lung disease/scarring. There is persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
