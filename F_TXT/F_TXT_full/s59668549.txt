AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained four hours earlier during the same day. Again noted is a hypoventilated appearance of both lungs related to poor inspiration. The left basal linear density is again identified and represents an atelectasis. There is no evidence of new acute pulmonary infiltrates and the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. No pneumothorax has developed. The ETT remains in unchanged appropriate position. The NG tube reaches well below the diaphragm including the side port and there is no further evidence of tube coiling in the hypopharynx.
