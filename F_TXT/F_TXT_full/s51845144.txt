Lines and tubes are grossly unchanged. Again seen is dense opacity along the upper left chest wall, not significantly changed compared with the most recent prior film, but probably slightly improved compared with ___ at 18:53. There is also persistent increased retrocardiac opacity, though the left hemidiaphragm remains visible. Hazy density at the left base laterally is in part due to overlying materials. No gross left effusion. There has been interval clearing of opacity that was previously seen at the right base.
