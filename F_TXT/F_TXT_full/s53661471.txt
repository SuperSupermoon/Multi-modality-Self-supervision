There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, the tip terminates 2.3 cm above the level the carina. Again seen are patchy bilateral airspace opacities in a predominately perihilar distribution consistent with pulmonary edema, infection cannot be excluded. The extent of parenchymal changes similar when compared to the prior study. No definite effusion seen. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. An nasogastric tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm. The tip is not visualized on this study. Degenerative changes in the bilateral shoulder joints.
