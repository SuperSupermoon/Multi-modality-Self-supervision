The lung volumes are noted to be decreased. The ET tube tip terminates 3 cm above the carina. Focal areas of increased density are seen within the right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and left lower lobe, and may be secondary to atelectasis versus aspiration. Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, left greater than right. There is stable, moderate to severe cardiomegaly. The mediastinum is somewhat widened, which may be secondary to both the projection and the patient position.
