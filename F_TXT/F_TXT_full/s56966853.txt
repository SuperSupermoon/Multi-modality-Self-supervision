Moderate left pleural effusion is slightly smaller now, following insertion of a small bore pigtail drainage catheter projecting over the left lower hemi thorax. No pneumothorax. Interval increase in caliber the cardiomediastinal silhouette compared to ___ is consistent with worsening severe cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. There is no mediastinal widening to suggest that any pericardial effusion is hemodynamically significant. Right lung is clear. No right pleural effusion.
