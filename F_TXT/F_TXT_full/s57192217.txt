As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The bilateral pigtail catheters in the pleural spaces are in constant position. The predominantly atelectatic opacities at the left lung base have minimally increased in extent, which might be attributable to the overall reduced lung volumes. The shape and appearance of the cardiac silhouette is constant. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Unchanged course and position of the feeding tube.
