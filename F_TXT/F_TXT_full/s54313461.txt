Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The intra-aortic balloon pump was adjusted, currently its tip approximately 2 cm above the carina. The Swan-___ catheter is at the level of right ventricle outflow tract. The appearance of tubes and lines is unchanged. Bilateral upper lobe consolidations are redemonstrated. The appearance is most likely representing a combination of pulmonary edema with potential left upper lobe collapse. No pneumothorax is seen.
