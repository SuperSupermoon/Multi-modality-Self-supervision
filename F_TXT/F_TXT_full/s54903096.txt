Single frontal view of the chest. There is a right pleural drain with interval decrease in size of a now small right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Moderate-sized left pleural effusion persists. Bibasilar consolidations are unchanged. Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
