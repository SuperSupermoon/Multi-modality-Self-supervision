In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the left chest tube has been removed. There is probably a tiny left apical pneumothorax. Otherwise, little overall change except for some decreased visualization of the medial portion of the left hemidiaphragm, raising the possibility of some increasing volume loss in the left lower lobe.
