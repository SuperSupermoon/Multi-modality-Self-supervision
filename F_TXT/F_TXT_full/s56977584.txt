Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Lungs are grossly clear except for a smoothly marginated 1.6 cm diameter opacity overlying the right fourth anterior rib, very likely due to a nipple shadow. As a lateral radiograph was not obtained, and as in this appears asymmetrical compared to the left side, a repeat radiograph with nipple markers is suggested to confirm this is a nipple and not a lung nodule.
