The endotracheal tube lies at the takeoff of the right mainstem bronchus and must be pulled back. Low lung volumes with mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Increased opacification at the left base is again consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss. Possibility of a region of infarction complicating the known massive pulmonary embolism would have to be considered. The right base is relatively clear. The position of the endotracheal tube was telephoned to Dr. ___ at 8:50 a.m., immediately after the low ET tube was detected at 849.
