If there is a residual pneumothorax, it is very small. Endobronchial stents are unchanged in position, as is the right apical pleural catheter. Remainder the lungs are clear but hyperinflated. No pleural effusion. Fullness of the right hilum is consistent with lymphadenopathy and known right apical nodule is seen to better detail on recent CT.
