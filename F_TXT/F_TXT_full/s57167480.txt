1. A tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. There is increasing opacification in the right hemithorax which likely reflects a combination of increasing pleural fluid and either lobar collapse from mucous plugging or evolving pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. In addition, there are patchy opacities in the left mid and lower lung which could reflect atelectasis or pneumonia, although these are not significantly changed. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given patient rotation on the current study.
