AS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS RADIOGRAPH FROM EARLIER THE SAME DATE, A LEFT PIGTAIL PLEURAL CATHETER HAS BEEN PLACED WITH SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION BUT DEVELOPMENT OF A MODERATE SIZED LEFT HYDRO PNEUMOTHORAX WITH SUBSTANTIAL BASILAR COMPONENT. RIGHT PIGTAIL PLEURAL CATHETER ALSO REMAINS IN PLACE WITH INCREASING SMALL RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION AND ADJACENT RIGHT BASILAR ATELECTASIS. NO OTHER RELEVANT CHANGE.
