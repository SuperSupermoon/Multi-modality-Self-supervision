Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There are persistent low lung volumes. Cardiomegaly is stable. Right IJ catheter tip is in the right atrium, should be withdrawn approximately 3 cm for more standard position. There is no pneumothorax. Diffuse bilateral lung opacities are unchanged. The opacities seen in the lungs are consistent with pulmonary edema and acute chest syndrome.
