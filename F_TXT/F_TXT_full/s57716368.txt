In comparison with the study of ___, there again is prominent scoliosis of the thoracic spine convex to the right. Little change in the appearance of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion. Retrocardiac opacification with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is again consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and small effusion. There is some hazy opacification at the right base which could represent layering effusion with compressive atelectasis. No free intraperitoneal gas is identified. However, this is not an upright view and CT would be necessary to definitely exclude pneumoperitoneum.
