In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain unchanged. There is again evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure and substantial layering left pleural effusion with right pleural effusion and substantial volume loss at the base. There is substantial widening of the mediastinum to the right of the trachea. This could represent extreme dilatation of a somewhat tortuous superior vena cava, related to severely elevated central pressure. On the left, there is the suggestion of an elliptical ossification adjacent to the upper mediastinum with pulmonary vessels seen through it. This raises the possibility of a loculated effusion either anterior or posterior to the lung. No evidence of pneumothorax. This information was discussed with ___, the resident taking care of the patient. Unfortunately, the condition of the patient is such that CT does not appear to be a viable possibility. Echocardiography of the upper mediastinal region could possibly better demonstrate these mediastinum and paramediastinal findings.
