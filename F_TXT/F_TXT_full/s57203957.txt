In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has been Re intubated with the tip of the endotracheal tube approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well into the distal stomach. Increasing opacification at the bases with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with layering pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis. The in the appropriate clinical setting, it would be very difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia.
