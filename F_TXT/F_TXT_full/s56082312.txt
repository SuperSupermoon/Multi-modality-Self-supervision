Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusion, stable on the right, has increased on the left since for 04:35 on ___. Opacification in both lungs, more severe in the right upper than the left, could be asymmetric edema alone, but pneumonia could be present as well. Heart is top-normal size. Fullness in the right tracheobronchial angle of the mediastinum could be due to adenopathy or mediastinal venous engorgement. However it was reported to me head echocardiography was negative for pericardial effusion.
