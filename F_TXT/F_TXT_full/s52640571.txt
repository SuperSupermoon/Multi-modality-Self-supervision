As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval placement of an enteric tube which courses below the diaphragm, its tip terminates in the gastric fundus. There is increased retrocardiac opacity as well as increased opacity at the left lung base, likely a combination of atelectasis and increased left pleural effusion. Nodular opacity at the right lung base may correspond to a lobulated pulmonary nodule identified in the right lower lobe on prior chest CT from ___. No new focal consolidations are identified. There is no definite pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated due to overlying lower left lung opacity. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
