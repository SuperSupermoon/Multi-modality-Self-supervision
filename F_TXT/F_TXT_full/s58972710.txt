A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Increased bilateral opacities, in the setting of cardiomegaly, are most likely due to congestive heart failure. There are probably small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is similar to the prior study. The patient is status post median sternotomy with an unchanged fractured upper sternal wire. No acute osseous abnormality is identified. Degenerative changes in the shoulder girdles are noted bilaterally. Increased densities projecting over the right upper quadrant are likely external to the patient. Left PICC line has been removed in the interim.
