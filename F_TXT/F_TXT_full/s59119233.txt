As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. As a consequence, areas of platelike atelectasis have newly appeared at the lung bases. In addition, on the right, the presence of a small pleural effusion cannot be excluded. The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumonia.
