AP chest compared to 5:42 p.m. on ___: Region of question developing right upper lobe pneumonia is unchanged since the prior study, quite small, but warrants further surveillance. I suggest repeat chest radiograph in 12 hours, sooner if symptoms develop. ET tube, right internal jugular line, nasogastric tube are in standard placements. Heart size and pulmonary vascular caliber has increased, suggesting volume overload or early cardiac decompensation. No pleural effusion.
