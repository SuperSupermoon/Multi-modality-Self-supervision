The patient is in slightly rotated position. This explains an overall apparent deviation of the trachea to the left. However, there is no focal narrowing of the tracheal lumen or focal tracheal displacement. Low lung volumes, bilateral basal areas of atelectasis but no evidence of pleural effusion or focal opacity typical for pneumonia. A right internal jugular vein catheter is in situ. The tip of this catheter projects over the right atrium, the device could be pulled back by 3-4 cm. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions.
