Enteric feeding tube is seen coursing midline with tip coiled in stomach and side ports below the level of the diaphragm. A right porta cath tip is seen in the low SVC. The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature. Bibasilar atelectasis is present. Mild cardiomegaly is likely accentuated due to low lung volumes and patient positioning. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Multiple clips and percutaneous gastrojejunostomy catheter is partially imaged. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen again demonstrates multiple mildly dilated air-filled loops of small bowel measuring up to 4.8 cm.
