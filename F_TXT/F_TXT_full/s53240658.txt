1. Interval placement of an endotracheal tube which has its tip approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 2. Right postoperative changes in this patient status post right upper lobectomy with improving aeration in the right mid and lower lung. There is a residual right pleural effusion. The left lung demonstrates stable diffuse interstitial abnormality and interval slight improvement in aeration at the left base suggests resolving superimposed atelectasis or edema. Pneumonia would be less likely. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits in this postoperative patient status post median sternotomy. A tiny amount of loculated air is again seen at the right apex.
