The nasogastric tube now courses below the diaphragm and is coiled projecting over the stomach. The right internal jugular central line and endotracheal tube are in satisfactory position. Lung volumes are slightly diminished and there are now faint patchy bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis given the lower lung volumes. Clinical correlation is recommended as aspiration should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
