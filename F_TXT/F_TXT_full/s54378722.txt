Pulmonary vasculature is generally engorged but there is no pulmonary edema. The only focal pulmonary abnormality is in the infrahilar right lower lobe and that could be atelectasis or pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion is likely. Heart size normal. No pneumothorax. Lines and tubes in standard placements.
