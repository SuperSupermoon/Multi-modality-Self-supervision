AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with a next preceding similar study of ___. The position of the ETT is unaltered and terminates some 4 cm above the level of the carina. A right-sided wide caliber sheath advanced via the internal jugular right approach remains in unchanged position. The same holds for a right-sided PICC line terminating in the mid portion of the SVC. A new NG tube is now seen reaching well below the diaphragm. Evidence of bilateral pleural effusion, slightly more on the right than the left appears unchanged. No pneumothorax on either side in the apical area.
