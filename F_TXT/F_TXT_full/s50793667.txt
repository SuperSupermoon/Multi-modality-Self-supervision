Opacity in the right lower lung with silhouetting of a portion of the right hemidiaphragm, right shift of the heart, and probable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is most compatible with atelectasis, new from the prior exam. The remaining right lung and left lung are essentially clear. No edema or large pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. The mediastinum is not widened. No acute osseous abnormality. Incompletely imaged coarse calcifications projecting over the right upper abdomen are consistent with sequelae of prior granulomatous disease, imaged more completely on the recent CT abdomen and pelvis.
