Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is a large right-sided pleural which is partially layering. This appears to have increased in size since the previous study. There is also a left-sided pleural effusion and left retrocardiac opacity. There remains some mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothoraces are seen. Tracheostomy tube is seen. There is a right-sided central line with the distal tip at the cavoatrial junction. The left-sided central line is removed. There is neck soft tissue swelling and linear lucency suspicious for subcutaneous gas. Further evaluation with neck radiographs or CT could be performed and this has been discussed with the clinical team.
