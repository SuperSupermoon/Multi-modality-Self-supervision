Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier. The tip end of the NG tube cannot be evaluated due to technique. The tube can be followed to the lower esophagus but exact location of the tip of the NJ tube is not visualized. There are no other interval changes with persistent low lung volumes, bibasilar atelectasis and cardiac size top normal. Right central catheter tip is at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein, is not curving to the upper SVC.
