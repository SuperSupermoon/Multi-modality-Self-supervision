The cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stably enlarged with particular prominence of the right hilum which could be all vascular although lymphadenopathy should also be considered. The pulmonary edema has resolved, although there is mild cephalization of the vasculature consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension. Patchy retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No pneumothorax.
