Heterogeneous opacification in the lower lungs is relatively mild and although I cannot exclude pneumonia, at least at the right lung base it looks more like atelectasis and minimal dependent edema. Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement have worsened since ___, stable since ___. ET tube and upper enteric drainage tube and right jugular central venous line are in standard placements respectively. Pleural effusion if present is not substantial. No pneumothorax. Sharp definition of the upper margin of the cuff of the ET tube indicates that secretions are pooling above that.
