Evaluation is limited due to rotation of the patient. Within this limitation, the ET tube tip terminates 2 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and coiling within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, likely within the gastric fundus. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contour is exaggerated due to low lung volumes and patient rotation. Opacification at the bilateral lung bases most likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
