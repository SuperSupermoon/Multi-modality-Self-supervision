Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates interval removal of the right chest tube. There is no pneumothorax. Left lung base consolidation is noted. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has slightly increased in size since study obtained five hours prior. Small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Cardiac size is difficult to discern due to adjacent opacities.
