As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The relatively extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities, predominating at the lung bases and in the left AP hilar region, are constant in severity and extent. No parenchymal opacities have newly appeared. No pleural effusions. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
