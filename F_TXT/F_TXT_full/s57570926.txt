As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. There are new small bilateral pleural effusions that have occurred in the interval. In addition, both lung bases show subtle parenchymal opacities. The size of the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Pneumonia is most likely differential diagnosis. However, the patient also suffers from sickle cell disease and the findings could be associated to this underlying disease. No pneumothorax.
