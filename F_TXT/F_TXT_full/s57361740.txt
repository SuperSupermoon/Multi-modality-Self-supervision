The left subclavian line tip overlies the right-sided mediastinal portion, at the level of the carina and compatible with the SVC. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Symmetrical, bilateral central parenchymal opacities are noted as before, consistent with pulmonary congestion and demonstrate interval improvement. Hazy densities at the bases of the lungs persist suggesting continued presence of bilateral pleural effusions in this semi-erect patient. There is no pneumothorax.
