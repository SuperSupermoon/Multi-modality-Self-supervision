AP chest compared to ___: Moderately severe widespread interstitial pulmonary abnormality has progressed in the absence of any evidence of cardiac decompensation, specifically no cardiomegaly, pulmonary or mediastinal venous engorgement, or appreciable pleural effusion. As such, differential diagnosis includes diffuse infection, including pneumocystis, leukemic infiltrates, drug or transfusion reaction, pulmonary hemorrhage, as well as noncardiac edema, which is the least likely diagnosis. Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC.
