1. The technique on this study is suboptimal and there are multiple overlying wires which are external to the patient obscuring detail. Given these limitations, the endotracheal tube appears to have its tip at the thoracic inlet and there is a left internal jugular central line with its tip in the proximal SVC. Nasogastric tube is seen to the level of the mid esophagus but is unable to be followed more distally, most likely due to the technical aspects of this examination as the nasogastric tube was appropriately positioned on the prior study at 5:03 a.m. Clinical correlation would be advised. The heart remains enlarged. There are bilateral layering pleural effusions, left greater than right. Lung volumes are diminished and there is likely stable mild-to-moderate interstitial edema. No pneumothorax is seen, although given the technical limitations of this study, the sensitivity is reduced. Followup imaging would be recommended.
