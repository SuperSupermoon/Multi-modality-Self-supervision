As compared to the previous radiograph, the effusion on the left has mildly decreased. This causes read ventilation of a middle and lower left lung parenchymal component. The large left apical opacity, however, is unchanged. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position. Due to patient rotation, very subtle right apical opacity is visible but likely related to patient position. However, this area should receive attention on further short term follow-ups, to exclude developing pneumonia.
