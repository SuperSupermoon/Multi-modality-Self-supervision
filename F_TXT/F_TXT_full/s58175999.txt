Lung volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring the some confluent opacity at the right base. Allowing for technical differences, this is likely similar to the film from ___ at ___:___ and is compatible with CHF. Again seen is increased retrocardiac density with obscuration left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Probable small to moderate left and at least small right pleural effusions appear similar to prior. Bibasilar opacities, greater on the left, appear more prominent as compared to the prior study. A right internal jugular Swan-___ catheter is present, with the tip ending in the region of the right main pulmonary artery, similar to prior. There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous line, with the tip ending in the right brachiocephalic vein. The endotracheal tube ends approximately 2.8 cm from the carina.
