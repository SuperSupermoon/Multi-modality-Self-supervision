AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Status post sternotomy and moderate cardiac enlargement as before. Again noted is a general widening and elongation of the thoracic aorta, but absence of any local contour abnormalities is absurd. Interstitial pulmonary abnormalities prominent in left upper lobe area and mid portion of right lung appear unchanged. No evidence of new acute pulmonary abnormalities is present and the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. A permanent pacer is now seen in left anterior axillary position being connected to one intracavitary electrode reaching the right atrial area and pointing with its tip towards the tricuspid area and probably entering the proximal portion of the lower right ventricle. The tip position is somewhat unusual as it does not reach far out in the apical area of the right ventricle. Appropriate contact with right ventricular myocardium must be assessed flioroscopically during the placement of electrode. Referring physician, ___, M.D. was paged at 3:30 p.m.
