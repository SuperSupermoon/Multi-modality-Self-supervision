1. Right PICC line, tracheostomy tube, left basilar chest tube remain in place. There is a stable left apicolateral pneumothorax. There is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle with associated lower lobe air space disease which may reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. The right lung demonstrates patchy opacity at the medial base which also likely reflects patchy atelectasis, less likely pneumonia. Cardiac mediastinal contours are likely stable. No pulmonary edema.
