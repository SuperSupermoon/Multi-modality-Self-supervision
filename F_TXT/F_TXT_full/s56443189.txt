Portable AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right-sided PICC, terminating at the cavoatrial junction. Additionally, there is a nasogastric tube which is seen coursing along the expected location of the esophagus and below the diaphragm, nonacute. A calcified ventriculoperitoneal shunt projects over the right hemithorax. Since the prior study, there has been interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions, although a small right pleural effusion persists. Multiple vascular clips project over the left axilla and hemithorax. Linear scarring along the left upper mediastinum may be due to prior radiation fibrosis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The bilateral hemidiaphragms are flattened, consistent with emphysematous change. Hazy opacification within the right lung base as well as the left lung base is likley due to atelectasis.
