There has been recent median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for post-operative status of the patient and accentuation by low lung volumes and leftward rotation. Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position, including a left-sided chest tube, with no visible pneumothorax. Bibasilar areas of atelectasis are present, left greater than right, overall improved since the intraoperative radiograph of earlier the same date.
