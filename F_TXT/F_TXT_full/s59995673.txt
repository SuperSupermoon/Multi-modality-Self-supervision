Multiple calcified pleural plaques are unchanged from yesterday. New increased opacity at the right lung base could represent aspiration. Indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion. Stable appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and elevated right hemidiaphragm. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
