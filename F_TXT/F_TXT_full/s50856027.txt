In comparison with the study ___ ___, there again is a tiny right apical pneumothorax. The right pigtail catheter is again seen. The hemidiaphragms are more sharply seen bilaterally and the costophrenic angles are clear. This could reflect progressive improvement in pleural effusions, but also could be a manifestation of a more upright position of the patient. Dense streak of atelectasis is again seen on the left. No vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
