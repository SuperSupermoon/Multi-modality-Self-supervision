A right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC. A nasogastric tube enters the stomach, tip not visualized. Multifocal airspace opacities, particularly in the perihilar locations and left lower lobe are most likely due to pulmonary edema. The opacity at the left lung base may be due to atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.
