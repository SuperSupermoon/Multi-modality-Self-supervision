AP chest view obtained with patient in supine position indicates that the patient is now intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea 4 cm above the level of the carina. The typical grid of a core valve can be identified in a location indicating aortic valve and proximal aorta. Heart size is not enlarged and there is no evidence of pulmonary congestion. A right internal jugular approach wire is seen terminating in a location, indicating the right ventricle. It is assumed that this is a temporary pacing wire. Electrode wire is overlying the left-sided lower neck region and terminates overlying the mediastinal structures. It is probably external. An NG tube is seen to reach below the diaphragm and is curled up in the stomach. Remarkable is the presence of three circular wires in sternotomy location which would indicate that the core valve replacement was combined with a partial surgical approach.
