There is significant rightward rotation on the current radiograph. Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable from prior exam. There is a mildly tortuous thoracic aorta. There is a poor inspiratory effort, and low lung volumes. Within this limitation, the lungs are clear. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
