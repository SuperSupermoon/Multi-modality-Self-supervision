The right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip at the cavoatrial junction or in proximal right atrium. A pull-back of approximately 2 cm was previously recommended. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Endotracheal tube is unchanged in position. Lung volumes remain low and there continue to be bibasilar airspace opacities which may reflect atelectasis and/or pneumonia. There is likely an associated left pleural effusion. There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are unchanged with a left ventricular prominence raising concern for underlying hypertension. Gastric distention is less on the current study.
