Right atrial and ventricular pacemaker/defibrillator leads course in expected position. Changes of coronary artery bypass grafting are seen, with median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged, though central venous congestion and interstitial edema have slightly improved. There are persistent small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar pulmonary opacities.
