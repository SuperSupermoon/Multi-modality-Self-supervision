There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular venous catheter with tip terminating at the cavoatrial junction. ET tube is present with tip 7 cm above the carina. Enteric tube is present with tip coiled in the stomach and side holes past the GE junction. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Consolidations in the right lung and left lower lung are nonspecific but may reflect aspiration. The left upper and mid lung are clear.
