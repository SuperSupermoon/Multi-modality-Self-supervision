Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Heart remains enlarged. There are layering bilateral effusions and persistent mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. Overall, the edema appears slightly worse. More focal airspace opacities at both bases, left greater than right, likely reflect compressive atelectasis. There is calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. No pneumothorax.
