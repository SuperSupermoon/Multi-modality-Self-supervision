There is no definite focal pulmonary abnormality. Right apex is obscured by the first rib and there is at least pleural parenchymal scarring there. If there is clinical concern for active hemoptysis, I would recommend chest CT scanning. Right lung base is elevated and the apex is laterally displaced. This is sometimes a finding of pleural effusion, but could also be due to the weekend diaphragm or subphrenic mass effect. There is no left pleural abnormality. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
