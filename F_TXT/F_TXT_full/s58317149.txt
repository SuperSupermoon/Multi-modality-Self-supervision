As compared to the recent radiograph of 3 hr earlier, a tracheostomy tube is been exchanged and a nasogastric tube has been advanced or repositioned, now terminating in the stomach. Right chest tube has also been replaced or repositioned. Extensive pneumomediastinum is again visualized extending cephalad into the soft tissues of the neck. Subcutaneous emphysema has decreased extent in the right chest wall but is otherwise similar. Widespread diffuse pulmonary opacities are again demonstrated. Known small pneumothoraces are seen to better detail on recent CT from earlier the same date.
