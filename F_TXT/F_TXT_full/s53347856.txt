Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy hardware/sternal fixation devices are again seen. There has been interval placement of a left subclavian central venous catheter, possibly a PICC, terminating in the distal SVC. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to a trace effusion. Left base retrocardiac opacity most likely represents atelectasis, less likely consolidation. Otherwise, no definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no pneumothorax.
