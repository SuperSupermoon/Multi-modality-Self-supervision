AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and chest CT from ___. The left subclavian line tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. Lungs are clear. The NG tube tip appears to be in the stomach, although the side hole is relatively proximal and thus the NG tube should be further advanced. The stomach is substantially distended as well as the bowel that could be seen at the CT abdomen obtained on same-day. Contrast material is seen in the right kidney with hydronephrosis, better assessed on the CT abdomen as well.
