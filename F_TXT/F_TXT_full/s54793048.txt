There is moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette. The aortic knob is calcified. There is mild pulmonary edema which has progressed compared to the previous exam. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted, with bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly reflecting atelectasis but aspiration or infection cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax but assessment of the lung apices is limited as the patient's chin projects over this region.
