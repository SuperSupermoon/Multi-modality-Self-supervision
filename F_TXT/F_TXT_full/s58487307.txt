A single portable AP upright view of the chest is provided. Apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette may relate to low lung volumes and the AP technique. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The lungs are low in volume but clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. An AICD device is again demonstrated over the left chest with a single lead terminating in the right ventricle.
