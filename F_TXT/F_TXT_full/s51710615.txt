There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 6.2 cm above the level of the carina. The lungs remain hyperinflated. There has been interval development of patchy opacity at the left lung base which may be due to atelectasis or aspiration, giving short-term interval. Patchy lateral right apical opacity is again seen, more prominent as compared to chest radiograph from ___, and while could theoretically be related to scarring, given patient is underlying emphysema and COPD and again, nonemergent chest CT recommended to further assess. Right infrahilar opacity may relate to confluence of vascular structures although consolidation underlying pulmonary nodule not excluded. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle. Mediastinal contours are stable. Hilar contours are stable. Cardiac silhouette is top-normal.
