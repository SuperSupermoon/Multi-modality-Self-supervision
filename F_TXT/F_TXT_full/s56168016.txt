Recent CT demonstrated severe septal thickening and traction bronchiectasis, suggesting background fibrotic disease. These background bilateral fibrotic changes, worse on the right with loss of right lung volume and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and rightward shift of the mediastinum are overall unchanged and better seen on CT dated ___. However, day-to-day changes in consolidation suggests at least some component of superimposed edema. Pulmonary edema has also progressed from the most recent exam, now moderate-to-severe. The heart size is also increased, now moderately enlarged. Pulmonary vessels appear more prominent. Probable left greater than right pleural effusion. The descending thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous, overall unchanged.
