As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no substantial change. The left central venous access line has been removed. Endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube remain in place. The parenchymal opacity on the right has minimally decreased in extent and severity, on the left the opacities are unchanged. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax. Unchanged minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting a small right pleural effusion.
