As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube has been removed. The patient, however, has received a right anterior pleural drain. The pre-existing right pneumothorax is not visible on the current image. A linear opacity overlying the sixth and seventh right rib is symmetrical and obviously caused by a foreign body outside of the patient. Close radiographic monitoring, however, is strongly recommended.
