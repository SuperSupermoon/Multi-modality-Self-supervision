Linear left basilar opacity is likely due to atelectasis given low lung volumes on the current exam. Calcific density again projects over the left upper lung laterally. The lungs are otherwise grossly unremarkable. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips again noted.
