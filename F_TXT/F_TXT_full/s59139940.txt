Redemonstrated is a right-sided internal jugular line seen terminating in the upper to mid SVC, unchanged in position and without evidence of pneumothorax. There is stable, moderate cardiomegaly with associated vascular congestion and unchanged mild to moderate pulmonary interstitial edema. There is a small left pleural effusion noted. A left-sided, retrocardiac opacification is once again identified, and may represent an effusion with adjacent atelectasis, although a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. Mediastinal contours are stable.
