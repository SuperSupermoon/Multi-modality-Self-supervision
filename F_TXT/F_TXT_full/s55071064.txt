Left lower lobe collapse improved minimally. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions improved minimally. Heart size top-normal. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged but I doubt there is pulmonary edema. No endotracheal tube is seen below C7, the upper margin of this study. Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
