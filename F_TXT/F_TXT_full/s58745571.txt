Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. There is mild prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature without frank interstitial edema. Lung volumes are low with bibasilar atelectasis. There is slightly increased right infrahilar density which is improved compared to prior examination where there was a prior pneumonia. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
