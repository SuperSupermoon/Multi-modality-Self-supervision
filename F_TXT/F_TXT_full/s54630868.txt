Patient is somewhat rotated in this examination. A tracheostomy tube is seen well positioned in the trachea. Left subclavian catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, the tip is not included in this examination. Allowing for positional changes, cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear normal. No definite pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Lower lung volumes exaggerate interstitial abnormalities present at lung bases, likely representative of fibrosis and alveolitis which is fully characterized on prior chest CT from ___.
