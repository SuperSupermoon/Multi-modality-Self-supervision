Compared to the prior study, the overall appearance is similar. Again seen is a chest tube at the left lung base. Also again seen is a small to moderate left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior study. No pneumothorax is detected. Atelectasis at the right base and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is essentially unchanged. Doubt overt CHF.
