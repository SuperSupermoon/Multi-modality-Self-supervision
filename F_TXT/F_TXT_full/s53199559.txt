Portable AP chest radiograph is a very kyphotic projection. The lung volumes are low and the left hemidiphragm is markedly elevated. Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate-sized at least, but cannot be completely described because the level of the diphragm is unknown. Right upper lobe consolidation raises concern for pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well visualized. Surgical clips, presumably from prior CABG, are noted. There is no pneumothorax.
