AP chest compared to ___. Severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality has developed since ___. Although the heart is no larger and there is only a small volume of new pleural effusion on the right and a stable small left pleural effusion, simplest explanation for the change is pulmonary edema, but I would consider noncardiogenic causes as well, including blood product administration or diffuse alveolar damage. A right jugular line ends low in the right atrium. Multiple pulmonary nodules are more readily visible today than on prior examination, presumed metastases.
