Comparison is made to previous study from six hours earlier. There is again seen a stable right upper lobe mass. There is bilateral costophrenic angle blunting likely due to small pleural effusions. There is left basilar atelectasis. No pneumothoraces are identified. Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are within normal limits. There is a right basilar chest tube which is unchanged in position.
