No detectable pneumothorax. Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum project over both lung apices, so that very small volumes of pleural air could be missed. Small bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left, is unchanged. Left pleural drain unchanged in position. Heart size normal. Lungs grossly clear.
