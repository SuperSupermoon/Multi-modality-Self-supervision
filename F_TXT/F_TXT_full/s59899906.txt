Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___. There is no pulmonary edema or appreciable right pleural effusion. Left lower hemi thorax is obscured by the chronically severely enlarged cardiac silhouette, although substantially smaller today than in ___, with a pericardial drainage catheter in place. There some left lower lobe consolidation and some left pleural effusion, and no pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. Atrioventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their expected courses. The unusual course of the left ventricular lead is also unchanged showing marked elevation of the coronary sinus with regard to cardiac silhouette, presumably a function of severe right atrial enlargement and perhaps residual pericardial effusion. This would require echocardiography or chest CT for confirmation, although that may not be clinically pertinent.
