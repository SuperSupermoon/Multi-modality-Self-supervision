An ET tube is approximately 5.3 cm from the carina. A right subclavian central line is seen in the lower SVC. On the most recent prior radiograph, there is no significant interval change. Hazy opacification bilaterally in the lower lung zones may represent a combination of fluid and atelectasis. There is no definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax. NG tube is seen below the diaphragm.
