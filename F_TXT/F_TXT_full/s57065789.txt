Moderate left pleural effusion persists. Left lower lobe atelectasis may be improving. There is the suggestion of a discrete round opacity in the left midlung at the level of the third anterior rib which alternatively could be superimposition of normal structures. It should be followed to see if there is a real abnormality which could be a pulmonary infarct or infection. Mild atelectasis persists at the right lung base medially. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal veins, are not engorged. No pneumothorax. Right PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
