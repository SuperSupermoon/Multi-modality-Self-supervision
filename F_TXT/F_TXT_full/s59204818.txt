Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The aortic knob is calcified. Mediastinal contour is otherwise similar compared with the prior study. Mild pulmonary edema is noted along with a moderate left pleural effusion. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis. Infection in the left lung base however is not completely excluded. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
