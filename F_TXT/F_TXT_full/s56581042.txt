AP chest compared to ___, 2:46 p.m.: Mild pulmonary edema persists. Right infrahilar consolidation is still minimal, perhaps atelectasis, perhaps a small pneumonia. There is no lobar collapse. Pleural effusions are small if any. Moderate cardiomegaly stable. ET tube in standard placement. Upper enteric drainage tube can be traced as far as the low esophagus, but the tip is indistinct. I see no central venous catheter.
