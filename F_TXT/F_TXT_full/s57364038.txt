An endotracheal tube is seen with tip 7 cm above the carinal and could safely be advanced 3 cm. An enteric tube terminates within the stomach. Bilateral parenchymal opacities continue to worsen, particularly on the right lower lobe. Heart is remains mildly enlarged and there is some prominence of the central vasculature. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The previously seen curvilinear lucency beneath the diaphragm is less conspicuous on this study.
