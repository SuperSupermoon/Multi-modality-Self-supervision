A large-bore dual-lumen catheter from an inferior approach is in unchanged position terminating near the inferior cavoatrial junction. There are bibasilar opacities and blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggestive of small effusions and atelectasis. Upper lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema is identified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The patient's AV graft projects over her right upper arm.
