Compared to prior study, a left-sided chest tube has been placed, with tip at the left lung apex. No obvious pneumothorax is identified, though a thin curvilinear lucency at the extreme apex of the left lung could represent either lucency from normal lung adjacent to rib or a extremely tiny pneumothorax. Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema along the left chest near the diaphragm is noted. Hazy opacity at the right lung base is new, likely a combination of a small effusion and underlying atelectasis. Patchy opacity at the left lung base is new and may also represent atelectasis or changes related to the ED chest tube. No gross left effusion. Upper zone redistribution, but doubt overt CHF. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Fusion construct at the thoracolumbar spine is new, grossly unremarkable on this limited assessment.
