Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained. Large hiatal hernia is re-demonstrated with interval increase in surrounding right basilar opacity which is likely due to effusion and atelectasis, though developing pneumonia cannot be excluded entirely. The remainder of the lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax or left pleural effusion. The heart is normal in size with normal mediastinal and hilar contours aside from slightly prominent ascending aortic contour likely due to tortuosity.
