Upright portable chest radiograph obtained. No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. Calcifications are noted in the right paratracheal region which appeared to represent vascular calcifications, less likely calcified granulomas. Calcification is noted at the costochondral junctions. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable. Bony structures are intact.
