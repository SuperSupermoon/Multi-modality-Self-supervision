A single semi-erect portable chest radiograph demonstrates decreased lung volumes from ___. The lungs are clear without evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Increased opacification at the lung bases without obscuration of the diaphragm or heart borders is consistent with atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable from the preceding study allowing for differences in technique. The thoracic aorta is mildly unfolded with calcification at the aortic knob.
