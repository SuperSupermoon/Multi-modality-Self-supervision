A tracheostomy tube is in-situ, with the tip abutting the tracheal wall. A right-sided subclavian Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid SVC. A left-sided internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC. Lung volumes are very low with significant bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. This results in crowding of the pulmonary bronchovascular structures limiting assessment. No worsening consolidation seen.
