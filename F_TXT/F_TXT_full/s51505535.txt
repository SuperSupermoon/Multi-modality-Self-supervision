Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomegaly is stable. The aorta is tortuous. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is in the stomach. There are low lung volumes. Right IJ catheter tip is in the distal SVC. Large right pleural effusion and moderate left effusion are grossly unchanged. Asymmetric opacities in the right upper lobe are concerning for pneumonia. There is mild vascular congestion. Bibasilar opacities likely atelectasis are unchanged.
