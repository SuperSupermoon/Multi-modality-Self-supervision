The lungs are well inflated. The right lung demonstrates mild interstitial markings that appear slightly improved compared with prior exam. The left lung demonstrates basilar atelectasis with associated pleural effusion not significantly changed since prior examination. Cardiac size cannot be properly assessed due to rotation of the patient during acquisition. Multiple rib fractures in the right are better assessed in prior CT. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Monitoring and supportive devices are noted in expected positions.
