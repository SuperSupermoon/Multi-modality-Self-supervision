A right-sided chest tube remains in place, with a persistent very small right apical pneumothorax. In addition to widespread subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum, there is also an apparent tiny left apical lateral pneumothorax. Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion has improved, and a more confluent opacity in the right infrahilar region also appears slightly better. No new or worsening areas of lung abnormality are detected.
