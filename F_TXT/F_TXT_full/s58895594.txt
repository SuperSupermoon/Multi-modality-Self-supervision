Heart size is probably normal. Full mediastinal contours difficult to evaluate as is the left hilus. The right hilar contour is grossly unremarkable. Left greater than right pulmonary opacities are redemonstrated corresponding to areas of loculated pleural effusion and metastatic lesions. There appears to be increased loculated pleural effusion component in the left upper lobe with compressive atelectasis of the adjacent lung parenchyma. There is no pneumothorax.
