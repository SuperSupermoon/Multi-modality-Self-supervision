Tip of left PICC is in the junction of the left subclavian and left brachiocephalic vein at the medial aspect of the left clavicle. Exam is otherwise remarkable for an approximately 2 cm diameter poorly defined nodular opacity at the level of the third anterior right rib. Two adjacent poorly defined nodular opacities are present just above and below this level as well. Lungs otherwise appear clear. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
