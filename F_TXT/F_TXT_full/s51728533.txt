As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Monitoring and support devices are constant. Also constant are the widespread bilateral multifocal parenchymal opacities and consolidation, containing multiple air bronchograms. The changes are overall more severe on the left than on the right. There is minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinuses, so that the presence of minimal bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded. No other changes in comparison with the previous image.
