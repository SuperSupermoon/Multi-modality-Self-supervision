Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Minimal ill-defined opacities are noted within the right lung base, and an infectious process cannot be completely excluded. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
