Endotracheal tube terminates 3.1 cm above the carina. OG tube terminates below the diaphragm. Left IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid-to-upper SVC. Sternotomy wires are intact. Metallic clip overlies the right mid abdomen. There has been interval increase in left pleural effusion, now large. The left upper and lower lobes are now substantially atelectatic. Indistinct right costophrenic angle is compatible with a small right pleural effusion, and small adjacent atelectasis is present. Pulmonary vasculature appears indistinct, compatible with increased pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Heart size appears stable.
