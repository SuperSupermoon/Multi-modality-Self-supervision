Left lower lobe is chronically atelectatic. Consolidation in the axillary region of the right long could be a chronic or recurrent finding something similar was present in ___ though not as extensive. Presumably the patient suffers recurrent aspiration, but other diagnoses should be entertained, including widespread bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma. Heart is mildly enlarged. Thickening of the pleural margins due to fat deposition and real pleural thickening is chronic. There is probably no appreciable acute pleural effusion. Heart is mildly to moderately enlarged and the upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is engorged, but I doubt that pulmonary edema is present. No pneumothorax.
