Single AP chest radiograph demonstrates an enlarged heart. Obscuration of bilateral costophrenic angles is suggestive of pleural effusions, right greater than left. Right hilar opacity appears to have been present on prior examination. New opacity projects over the right lower lung zone, concerning for infectious process. Overall appearance of the left hemi thorax is similar relative to prior examination. Retrocardiac airspace opacities persist. There is no overt pulmonary edema or evidence of a pneumothorax. Prominent central pulmonary vasculature is not significantly changed.
