AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained seven hours earlier during the same day. The AP single radiograph demonstrates unchanged position of the previously described small caliber pigtail ending pleural drainage catheter. There is no evidence of any remaining apical pneumothorax. However, hazy density occupying the entire left side hemithorax and elevated diaphragm is suggestive of pleural effusions layering in the posterior pleural spaces. The right hemithorax is unremarkable as before.
