Heart size is mildly enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. New consolidative opacification is seen involving the entire left upper lobe. Right lung is clear. Hyperinflation of the lungs with attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices is compatible with underlying emphysema. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. Cholecystectomy clips are demonstrated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
