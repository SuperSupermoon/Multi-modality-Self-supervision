AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Port-A-Cath catheter tip terminates at the level of cavoatrial junction. There are multiple pulmonary nodules and masses, concerning for metastatic spread. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is most likely present. Given the absence of prior available history, it is unclear if the primary is within the lungs or outside of the chest. Questionable sclerotic lesions in the right humeral head are noted, dedicated examination is suggested.
