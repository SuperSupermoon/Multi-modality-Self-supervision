Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinum is grossly unremarkable. Left minimal basal opacity is noted that might reflect aspiration versus infectious process. No definitive consolidation is seen. Similar but substantially small abnormality is noted in the right lung base. There is no pneumothorax. No appreciable pleural effusion is noted.
