Patient has been extubated since prior exam. Left jugular line remains in adequate position in the upper SVC. The stomach is more distended since prior exam and left lower lobe consolidation and moderate pleural effusion have worsened; this is worrisome for aspiration. Right basal atelectasis is unchanged. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax.
