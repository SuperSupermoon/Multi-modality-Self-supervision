In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, with the side port close to the esophagogastric junction. It could be pushed forward about 5 cm for more optimal positioning. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been pulled back so that the tip is in the most proximal portion of the right pulmonary artery. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist, appearing somewhat more prominent in the right lower and left upper zones.
