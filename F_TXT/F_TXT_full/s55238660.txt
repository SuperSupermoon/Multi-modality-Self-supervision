A right PICC courses into the upper SVC. An enteric tube terminates in the stomach. There has been further reduction in the volume of bilateral pleural effusions, now small. Increased opacity at the right lung base is likely in part atelectasis, but early consolidation cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. Cardiac silhouette is normal size. Mediastinal contours are unchanged.
