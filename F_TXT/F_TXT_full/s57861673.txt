Due to technique and patient body habitus evaluation of the lungs is very limited. The tip of the NG tube cannot be clearly seen, can be followed to the lower esophagus. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Right PICC tip is in the upper SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Left HD catheter is in standard position. Retrocardiac opacities are unchanged consistent with large area of atelectasis. Extensive bilateral opacities partially due to pulmonary edema have minimally improved. The opacities are larger on the right with some nodular component. There are presumed small right greater than left pleural effusion
