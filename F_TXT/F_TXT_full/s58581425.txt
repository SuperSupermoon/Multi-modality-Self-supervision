Multi focal pulmonary consolidation has improved consistent with some clearance of pneumonia. Left pleural thickening is chronic but a small left pleural effusion may be present. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is no good evidence for pulmonary edema. ET tube is in standard placement, right jugular line ends in the low SVC and a nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax. Esophageal probe ends above the thoracic inlet.
