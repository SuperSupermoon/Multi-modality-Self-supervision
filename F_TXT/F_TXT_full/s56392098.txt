ET tube tip 2.8 cm above the carina. Local increase in caliber about the distal ET tube immediately above the level of the medial clavicular heads raises the question of slight distension of the ET tube balloon/cuff. The appearance is improved compared with ___, but remains slightly prominent. The NG tube tip and side-port extend beneath diaphragm, with the NG tube tip extending off the film. . Right IJ central line tip overlying the upper/mid right atrium, unchanged. No pneumothorax is detected. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Minimal upper zone redistribution and slight is also unchanged. Patchy bibasilar opacities are probably similar. However, on the current study, there is partial obscuration left hemidiaphragm. No right pleural effusion. Small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. Known left-sided rib and scapular fractures are noted, but not well depicted radiographically.
