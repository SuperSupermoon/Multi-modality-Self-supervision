Heart size is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The mediastinal contours unremarkable. Lung volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular structures. There is likely mild pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities within the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis though infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No definite subdiaphragmatic free air is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Clips and common bile duct stent are seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
