Again noted is stable appearance of multiple clips overlying the mediastinum. Right sided tubular structure is likely overlying the patient. Lung volumes are slightly smaller than on prior examination. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable since the prior examination. There is slight increase in interstitial opacity and pulmonary vascular congestion.Again noted is a large hiatal hernia. Right basilar opacity is again demonstrated, involving portions of the right middle and right lower lobe, slightly improved in the right lower and slightly worse in the right middle lung with increasing obscuration of the right heart border. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
