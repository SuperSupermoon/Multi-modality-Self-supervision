The study is limited due to exclusion of part of the left hemithorax. There are no focal opacities in the imaged lungs. There is no pleural effusion in the right or pneumothorax. Sternotomy wires are intact and a prosthetic aortic valve is present. Severe degenerative changes of the right shoulder are also noted.
