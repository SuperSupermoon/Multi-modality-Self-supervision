Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates ET tube terminating 4.6 cm above the carina. There is no pneumothorax. NG tube terminates in the stomach. There is near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax, which corresponds to areas of consolidations and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. There is relative sparing of the upper lungs. opacities are also noted in the left lower lobe. There is no left pleural effusion. Heart size is difficult to assess due to adjacent opacities. Port-A-Cath tip projects over proximal right atrium. Multiple surgical clips are seen in the left axilla and left lateral chest wall. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
