Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from ___. Again, there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle may be due to atelectasis versus small effusion. Left lung is clear, noting that the costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. New left-sided central catheter is seen; however, the tip projects over the upper mediastinum on the left. Anterior cervical fixation hardware is identified.
