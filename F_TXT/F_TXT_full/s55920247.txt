AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Severe pulmonary consolidation is asymmetrically distributed, predominantly right upper lobe and left perihilar and lower lung. This would raise some concern for pneumonia, except that these findings appeared over course of 24 hours, a little rapid for pneumonia, though I cannot exclude that. Alternatively asymmetric pulmonary edema could explain all the findings, and there is clearly at least moderate edema present elsewhere in the lungs, as well as an increasing moderate right pleural effusion. The heart size is difficult to assess, probably not greatly enlarged though mediastinal and pulmonary vessels are engorged.
