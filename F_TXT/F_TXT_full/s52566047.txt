As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been essentially no significant change. Lung volumes are slightly increased; however, there is still crowding of bronchovascular structures and accentuation of the cardiac silhouette. No new focal consolidations are identified. The right PICC line tip now projects over the low SVC, at the cavoatrial junction. Right IJ catheter is unchanged, extending to the mid portion of the SVC.
