In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the superior clavicular level, approximately 5.4 cm above the carina. There is again opacification at the right base with silhouetting of the heart border and hemidiaphragm and a characteristic oblique outer margin, consistent with collapse of the right middle and lower lobes, presumably related to mucus plug. This information has been telephoned to Dr. ___, who is covering for Dr. ___.
