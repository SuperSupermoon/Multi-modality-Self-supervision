As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the more proximal parts of the stomach. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. In interval, the lung volumes have decreased, with signs of crowding of vascular and bronchial structures, predominantly at the lung bases. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis.
