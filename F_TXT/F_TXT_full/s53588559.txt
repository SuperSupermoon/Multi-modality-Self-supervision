The heart size is normal. Previously seen pneumomediastinum appears to have resolved. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Calcified bilateral pleural plaques are again seen with unchanged pleural thickening and chronic loculated pleural effusion within the right lung base and right apex. Multifocal opacities within the left mid lung field peripherally, as well as within both lower lung fields appear progressed when compared to the prior radiograph, and the opacities in the left lung appear more severe than compared to the prior chest CT. No pneumothorax is seen. Numerous clips are demonstrated within the gastroesophageal region.
