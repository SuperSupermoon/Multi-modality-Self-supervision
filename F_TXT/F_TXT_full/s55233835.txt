A large area of consolidation at the base the left lung has worsened dramatically since midnight, with relatively little change at the right base and only mild vascular engorgement throughout the lungs. Therefore asymmetric edema is much less likely than fulminant pneumonia, probably aspiration, alternatively, but also less likely, pulmonary hemorrhage. Heart is top-normal size. Moderate right pleural effusion is stable. Small left pleural effusion has probably increased. No pneumothorax.
