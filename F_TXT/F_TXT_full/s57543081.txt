Comparison is made with prior study CTA ___. Small left pneumothorax is better seen in prior CT. Cardiomediastinal contours are midline. Cardiac size is normal. Multiple left rib fractures are again noted. Small left effusion has increased. Left basal opacities have increased, could be due to atelectasis or aspiration. Opacities in the right lower lobe are grossly unchanged.
