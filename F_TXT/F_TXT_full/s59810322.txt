Again seen is a left PICC line, with tip near the SVC/RA junction. There are markedly low inspiratory volumes, which limits assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma. There is also slightly rotated positioning. Allowing for this, there is patchy opacity at the left base, with partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and possibility of an early pneumonic infiltrate or area of aspiration cannot be excluded. There is atelectasis at the right lung base. There is pulmonary vascular plethora, while this could relate to CHF/fluid overload, though this is also likely accentuated by the low lung volumes. Opacity at the right cardiophrenic region is again seen and could relate to known prior aspiration.
