AP chest compared to ___ at 11:59 p.m.: Right pigtail pleural drainage catheter projects over the right lower lateral hemithorax. Right pneumothorax has been almost entirely evacuated, mediastinum has returned to ___ and the right hemidiaphragm to its physiologic position. Lung volumes are quite low now, exaggerating what is probably mild pulmonary edema. ET tube, left internal jugular line and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements, and on this supine radiograph, there is no indication of pneumoperitoneum, though small amounts of subdiaphragmatic gas would not be evident on the supine view.
