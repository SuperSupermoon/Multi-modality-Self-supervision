Partially evaluated cervical spinal hardware, new since the earlier radiograph. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea. Low bilateral lung volumes. Mild left basilar atelectasis. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The size of the cardiac silhouette is enlarged but this may be technical secondary to AP technique and low lung volumes.
