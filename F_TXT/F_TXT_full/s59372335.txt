The lungs are relatively well inflated, with persistent scarring in the left lung base, with no focal consolidation identified. The heart size is stable compared to prior studies. A right chest wall pulse generator is unchanged in position, with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, as before. There is no large pleural effusion, overt pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.
