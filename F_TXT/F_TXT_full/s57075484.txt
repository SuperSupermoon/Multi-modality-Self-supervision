AP chest compared to ___, 6:10 p.m.: There has been no change in the chest compared to the first image performed on ___, 6:10 p.m. Second image showed clearing of what was questioned to be a peribronchial infiltrative process. At worst, today's study shows mild vascular congestion in the left lung, but it could be entirely clear. The right, however, is still grossly abnormal, including right middle and upper lobe collapse around a large hilar mass, severe edema in the right lung and at least a moderate right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
