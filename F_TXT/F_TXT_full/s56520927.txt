Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is a left-sided central line with distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. There is a feeding tube whose tip is not seen and off the edge of the film, but likely within the stomach. Heart size is unchanged and within normal limits. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion. There has been improvement of the pulmonary edema since the prior study. There remain areas of consolidation within the left base, which may represent residual pulmonary edema versus developing infiltrate or atelectasis.
