AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Tracheostomy is in place with its tip terminating approximately 5 cm above the carina. Left subclavian line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Two right chest tubes are in place. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis are redemonstrated, but overall no substantial change since prior examination is seen as well as no definitive evidence of reaccumulation of fluid is present. When compared to ___, obtained at midnight, questionable increase in the opacification of the right lower lobe cannot be excluded and might reflect either developing infectious process in this area or increasing effusion, and close followup is recommended.
