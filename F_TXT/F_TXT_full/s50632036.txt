1. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet. There are moderate-sized bilateral effusions. In addition, there is increasing airspace opacity in both lungs, right greater than left, which most likely reflects asymmetric moderate pulmonary edema, although an infectious process should also be considered. Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis of the left lower lobe related to the presence of an effusion. No pneumothorax is seen; however, the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-upright technique. Mediastinal contours are stable.
