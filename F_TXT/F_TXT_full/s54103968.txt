Opacification of the apex of the right chest is unchanged, a combination of pleural fluid and hematoma, as seen on yesterday's CT. Layering basilar right pleural effusion is also unchanged after removal of the basilar right chest tube; the right tube coursing medially to the apex is undisturbed. Consolidation in the right mid lung seen on yesterday's CT is mildly decreased. Left lung edema and small left pleural effusion persist. No pneumothorax is detected. Right hilar and apical vascular clips and chest wall ___ reflect lobectomy, SVC reconstruction, and more recent exploratory thoracotomy. Sternal wires are intact over the lower half of the sternum. Endotracheal tube tip projects 2 cm above the carina. Esophageal catheter courses below the diaphragm and out of view. Cardiomediastinal contours appear unchanged.
