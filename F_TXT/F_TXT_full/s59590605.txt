1. Significant interval improvement in aeration in the right upper lobe with near-complete resolution of the right upper lobe collapse. More focal patchy opacity in the left mid lung remains suggestive of atelectasis. The pneumopericardium is stable. Stable post-operative cardiac and mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy. There continues to be a relative hyperlucency in the left costophrenic sulcus, which could reflect an anterior pneumothorax. Followup imaging in the upright or decubitus position would be advised. Interval resolution of mild pulmonary edema. No large effusions. Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, mediastinal drains and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position.
