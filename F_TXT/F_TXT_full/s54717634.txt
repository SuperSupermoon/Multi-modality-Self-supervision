Previous mild pulmonary edema and heterogeneous consolidation in the right lower lobe which may have been residual atelectasis, have both improved. There is still focal consolidation on the left obscuring the margin the descending thoracic aorta. This may well be pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion is stable. Mild cardiomegaly is more pronounced and pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature are still engorged. ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements and esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
