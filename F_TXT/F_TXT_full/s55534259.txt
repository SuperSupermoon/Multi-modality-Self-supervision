New left internal jugular central venous catheter has been placed and a guidewire remains in situ, initially coiling in the right ventricle before coursing into the right atrium and the IVC, wtih tip beyond the limits of the film. Remnant right IJ catheter and ventriculoperitoneal shunt are stable. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Retrocardiac opacity is consistent with atelectasis. No lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
