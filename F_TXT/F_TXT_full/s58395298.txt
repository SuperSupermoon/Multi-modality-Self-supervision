Moderate loculated left pleural effusion is unchanged from prior. Bibasilar opacities are noted. There is prominence of the right mediastinum, suggestive of vascular congestion. Aortic arch calcifications are noted. Heart size is top normal. Mild pulmonary edema is present. Sternotomy wires are noted. Multiple surgical clips project over left cardiac border.
