There is an unchanged orientation of a right-sided chest tube overlying the right hemithorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable, within normal limits. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. Lung volumes are low. Hazy diffuse right airspace opacities likely reflect crowding of normal bronchovascular structures. No focal consolidation. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is identified. No sizable pleural effusion. Mildly displaced posterior right fifth and sixth rib fractures are noted.
