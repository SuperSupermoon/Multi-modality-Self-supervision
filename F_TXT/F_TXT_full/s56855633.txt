The lungs are well expanded. There are no focal parenchymal opacities. There is mild bilateral hilar engorgement and vascular upper redistribution, suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema. The heart is moderate to severely enlarged and a unicameral ICD device is seen in the left axilla with the lead ending in the heart base. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
