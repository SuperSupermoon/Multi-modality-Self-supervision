Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Poorly defined opacity at the left lung base with associated obscuration of left lateral costophrenic angle could reflect focal atelectasis or consolidation adjacent to a small pleural effusion. Lungs are otherwise clear except for minimal linear atelectasis at the right base and biapical pleural parenchymal scarring.
