Compared with 1 day earlier, 1 of the 2 left chest tubes has been removed. A single left-sided chest tube remains, with tip overlying the left upper lung. No obvious pneumothorax is detected, though a tiny left apical pneumothorax could still be present. Again seen is evidence of volume loss on the left, with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, leftward shift of mediastinum, and atelectasis at the left base. Surgical clips noted at the lung apex. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is seen, much more so than on the prior film. Except for minimal bibasilar atelectasis and slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle not significantly changed, the right lung is grossly clear, without CHF or focal consolidation. Note is made of some prominent air-filled loops of bowel in the left upper quadrant, not frankly dilated.
