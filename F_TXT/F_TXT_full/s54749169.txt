Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing 1.8 cm above the carina. The OG tube courses into the left upper quadrant with the distal side port below the level of the diaphragm. The lungs appear clear bilaterally. The hila appears somewhat prominent though this could be due to portable supine technique. The heart size is normal. No supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax. The imaged osseous structures appear intact.
