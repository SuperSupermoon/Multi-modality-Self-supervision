Rotated positioning. Compared with ___ at 15:09 p.m. and allowing for technical differences, no gross changes are identified. There may be some subtle increased confluence of the opacity in the right mid zone. The left mid/base opacities are essentially unchanged. Small left effusion also again noted.
