In comparison with the study of ___, the bibasilar opacification has somewhat decreased bilaterally. The time course suggests that much of this appearance may have reflected improved pulmonary edema. Nevertheless, there is continued engorgement of pulmonary vessels more prominent on the right, consistent with some persistent elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Hazy opacification on the right suggests pleural fluid. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would certainly have to be considered. Loss of the medial aspect of the left hemidiaphragm suggests some volume loss in the retrocardiac portion of the lower lobe.
