The heart is normal in size. There is mild unfolding and calcification along the arch and descending thoracic aorta. Patchy medial basilar opacities suggest minor atelectasis in association with low lung volumes. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Moderate rightward focal convex curvature is centered along the upper lumbar spine, but not well visualized with suspected associated degenerative change.
