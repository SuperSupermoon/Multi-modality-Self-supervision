Nasogastric tube, right subclavian PICC line and endotracheal tube are likely unchanged in position. Two left-sided pigtail catheters remain in place. No definite left-sided pneumothorax is appreciated, although the patient is only at a ___-degree upright angle which reduces the sensitivity for detection. There is likely a stable layering right effusion. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to patient rotation on the current examination. Persistent patchy opacity at the right base likely reflects an element of compressive atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
