The tracheostomy tube is in standard position. An orogastric feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. Small bilateral pleural effusions appear unchanged on the right and slightly decreased on the left compared to the prior study of ___. Bibasilar opacities appear stable and likely reflect a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, greater on the right than the left. In the appropriate clinical context, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Pulmonary vascular congestion and asymmetric interstitial pulmonary edema greater on the right than the left is similar to the prior study. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated due to obscuration by pleural parenchymal abnormalities. The prominent mediastinum is unchanged in contour from ___. Inferior subluxation of the right humeral head is incidentally noted.
