Extreme right lung apex excluded from the film. Allowing for this, no pneumothorax is detected. Pleural fluid is again seen extending along the left lung apex, probably similar in extent, allowing for differences in positioning. The tip of the ET tube is not well delineated, but it probably lies approximately 8.7 cm above the carina, immediately below the level of the clavicular heads. NG type tube present, extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Right IJ central line --___ Swan-Ganz catheter --___ tip again noted in the region of the RV outflow tract --___ correlation requested. Left subclavian PICC line tip over proximal/mid SVC. Surgical ___ noted over the left chest. Subcutaneous emphysema is noted adjacent to the lower left chest wall. A linear density seen near the subcutaneous emphysema at the left chest base is of uncertain etiology or significance. No left-sided chest tube is identified. Extensive vascular plethora, diffuse vascular blurring, and some areas of confluent opacity are again noted in both lungs, similar to the prior study. Cardiac opacity also similar to the prior study. Right costophrenic angle excluded from the film.
