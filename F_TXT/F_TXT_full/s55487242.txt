Patient has severe bronchiectasis and emphysema, as well as biapical scarring suggesting previous tuberculosis. There is substantially greater heterogeneous infiltration of both mid and upper lung zones today than in ___, not much change since earlier in many. The presumption is that there is substantially more infection in the lungs now than in ___ and therefore tuberculosis is of concern, but it should be kept in mind that pulmonary edema could simulate the findings of infection. Since we have a chest CT as recent as ___, repeat chest CT might be useful in deciding the most clinically significant current conditions.
