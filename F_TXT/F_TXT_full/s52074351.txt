The lung volumes are low, with bibasilar atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with a mildly tortuous thoracic aorta with atherosclerotic calcification in the aortic knob. Pleural effusions, if any, are small. Small right sided pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. There is no pneumothorax. Old healed left posterior rib fractures are seen.
