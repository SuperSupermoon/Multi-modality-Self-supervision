Marked interval improvement in bilateral diffuse alveolar opacities, consistent with resolving pulmonary edema in the setting of recent dialysis. Residual edema affects the left lung to a slightly greater degree than the right. Cardiac size has slightly decreased in size in the interval, and azygos vein distention has slightly decreased as well. Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.
