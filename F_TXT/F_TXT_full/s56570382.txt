Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient rotation. Calcified hilar nodes are consistent with known sarcoidosis. There continues to be deformity of the right upper chest wall with some right lateral pleural thickening and scarring with volume loss at the right medial lung base. However, there has been interval obscuration of the lateral aspect of the left hemidiaphragm which when correlated with the recent CT may reflect an early pneumonia or aspiration. Clinical correlation is recommended. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. No obvious pleural effusions.
