In comparison with study of ___, there is general haziness of the hemithoraces with preservation of pulmonary markings. This could reflect scattered radiation related to the size of the patient. However, there are probably substantial layering pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases. The possibility of supervening aspiration is impossible to exclude on this study. If the condition of the patient permits, a lateral view would be most helpful. The status of the pulmonary vasculature is difficult to assess. There is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with a dual-channel pacemaker device in place. A large bore central catheter is again seen.
