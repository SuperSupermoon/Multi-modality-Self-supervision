AP chest compared to ___:08 p.m.: NG tube traverses the neoesophagus at the level diaphragm. Bilateral pleural tubes end in the apices of each hemithorax. Left pneumothorax is small, not necessarily new. No pneumothorax on the right where the patient has had a rib osteotomy, and there is localized pleural abnormality probably hematoma, but no appreciable hemothorax. Right lower lobe is atelectatic, probably a function of compression by the neoesophagus which is distended. Moderate cardiomegaly has increased. Pneumoperitoneum is unchanged.
