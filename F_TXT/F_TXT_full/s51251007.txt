No previous images. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is mild prominence of interstitial markings at the bases, which could reflect chronic pulmonary disease, elevated pulmonary venous pressure, or both. No evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. Areas of lucency air seen beneath the hemidiaphragms. This is consistent with the appearance on the recent CT scan and would not suggest free intraperitoneal gas and less there are appropriate clinical symptoms.
