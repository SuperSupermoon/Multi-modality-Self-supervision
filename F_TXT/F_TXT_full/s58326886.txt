As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 6 cm above the carina. In the interval, the patient has developed bilateral pleural effusions of mild-to-moderate extent, with subsequent areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases. No pneumothorax. Minimal blunting of left mediastinal structures, likely caused by patient's rotation.
