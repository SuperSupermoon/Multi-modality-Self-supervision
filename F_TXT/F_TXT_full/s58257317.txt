Moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened. Greater opacification in the lung bases is probably dependent edema on the left but on the right where it is more confluent there could be concurrent pneumonia. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. No pneumothorax. Right PIC line has been withdrawn to the upper SVC. New tracheostomy tube in standard placement. No evidence of surgical complication.
