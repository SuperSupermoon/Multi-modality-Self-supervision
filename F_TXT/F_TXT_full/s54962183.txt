1. Endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the stomach, unchanged. Lungs appear clear.

No focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
