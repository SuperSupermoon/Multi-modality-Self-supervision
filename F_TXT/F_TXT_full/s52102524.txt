The sidehole is approximately 4-5 cm from the gastroesophageal junction. Lung volumes remain low. There are areas of atelectasis at both lung bases. In addition, mild fluid overload is present. The cardiac silhouette continues to be large. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
