Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard position. Lung volumes are extremely low, accentuating cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Apparent worsening lower lung pleural and parenchymal opacities may at least in part be due to differences in lung volumes. Similarly, apparent worsening vascular engorgement could be due to accentuation by low volumes. With this in mind, repeat radiograph performed at a higher lung volume setting would be helpful for more direct comparison to previous exams.
