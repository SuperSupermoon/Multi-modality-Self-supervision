Dense consolidations are noted in the retrocardiac left lung base, as well as ground-glass opacities within the left upper lung. A mechanical heart valve is present, along with mild cardiomegaly and aortic calcifications. Calcific densities also project over the cardiac silhouette, location of which is uncertain. A left pleural effusion is likely. The right hemi thorax is grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax.
