Heart size is top-normal. New enlargement of the hila is noted. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. There is no pneumothorax. Diffuse increased interstitial markings is present, with a new increased opacity at the right lung base. Left lower lobe consolidation is also present, likely largely due to atelectasis. Again noted is a round structure with rim calcification projecting over the left lung apex, which may be located in the lung parenchyma or in the neck. Lack of additional vascular calcifications argues against a calcified aneurysm. Degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
