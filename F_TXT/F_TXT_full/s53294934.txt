Left subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. Interval removal of the right internal jugular large bore catheter. Bilateral layering effusions, right greater than left. Given differences in positioning, these are likely not significantly changed. Stable scattered patchy opacities in both lungs which either reflect patchy atelectasis or an infectious process. No developing airspace consolidation is appreciated. Clinical correlation is recommended. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
