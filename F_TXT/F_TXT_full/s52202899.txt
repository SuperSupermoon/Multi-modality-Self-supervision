An improved position of the endotracheal tube, with the tip now terminating approximately 5 cm above the carina. There is persistent opacification at the left lung base, since the earlier study on ___, likely reflecting a small left pleural effusion and atelectasis. There is a recurrent opacity at the right lung base, which is also most compatible with atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. There is increased mild pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated in the setting of left basilar opacification. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged. There is mild calcification of the aortic knob.
