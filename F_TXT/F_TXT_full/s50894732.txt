Pulmonary vasculature is engorged and the heart is slightly larger in caliber today than before, but within normal limits. No pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube ends above the clavicles, even with the chin down, no less than 6 cm from the carina. It should be advanced 2.5 cm for a more secured seating. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC, dual-channel left internal jugular dialysis set ends in the low SVC. Nasogastric tube ends in the mid portion of a non-distended stomach. No pneumothorax.
