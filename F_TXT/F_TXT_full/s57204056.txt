AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 5:37 a.m.: Esophageal stent has not migrated from earlier position, starting at the level of the sternal notch. It is intact as to caliber. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements. Very large pneumoperitoneum is essentially unchanged. Large scale aspiration to the axillary region of the left lung has improved, but mild pulmonary edema is probably present. Heart size is normal. As before, the right lower hemithorax is entirely replaced by a large cavitary pneumonia, inseparable from the pleural space containing residual contrast agent, presumably employed to define the pulmonary or esophagopleural fistula. No pneumothorax.
