Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Previous cardiomegaly is stable. A small right pleural effusion has increased with increasing adjacent atelectasis in the right lower lobe. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard positions including a left basal pigtail catheter. There is no evident pneumothorax. Left mid and left lower lobe opacities are grossly unchanged, are a combination of pleural effusion and multifocal consolidations/atelectasis.
