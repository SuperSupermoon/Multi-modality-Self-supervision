The year referring physician reports that the new, substantial pneumoperitoneum follows recent percutaneous gastrostomy. Since this is a relatively large amount of free subdiaphragmatic gas, followup both clinical and radiographic is indicated. A new tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. There is either new pneumomediastinum to the left of the trachea at the thoracic inlet or mild distention of the upper esophagus, following removal of the esophageal drainage tube. Left lower lobe remains collapsed, moderate left pleural effusion stable. Somewhat smaller right pleural effusion decreased. No pneumothorax.
