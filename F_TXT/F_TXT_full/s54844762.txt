Lordotic positioning. Compared with the prior film, the interstitial markings have improved, suggesting that this may have reflected interstitial edema or less likely an interstitial infiltrate. At present, no increased interstitial markings or CHF is identified. Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to prior, possibly minimally improved. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, but no gross effusion.
