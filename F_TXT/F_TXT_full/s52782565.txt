In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better inspiration. Continued opacification at the right base again could reflect atelectatic changes or possibly even be a manifestation of superimposed pneumonia or contusion. The left hemidiaphragm is less well seen and there is blunting of the costophrenic angle, consistent with volume loss at the left base and pleural fluid. Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. No evidence of pneumothorax.
