In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better inspiration. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and there is continued elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The bases of the lungs are more sharply seen, which could reflect either decreased pleural fluid or a more erect position of the patient. An area of more localized opacification in the left mid to lower lung zone could possibly represent a developing consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting. Endotracheal, nasogastric, and right IJ tubes are unchanged.
