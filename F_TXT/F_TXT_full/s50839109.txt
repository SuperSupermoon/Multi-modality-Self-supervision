The tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 3 cm from the carina. The enteric tube courses beyond the diaphragm, terminating in the left upper quadrant, likely in the region of the stomach. The lungs are relatively well inflated with obscuration of the costophrenic angles bilaterally, likely a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis. Heart size is within normal limits and the cardiomediastinal contour is normal. Exuberant costochondral calcifications are noted bilaterally.
