The patient is status post right upper lobectomy with redemonstration of volume loss in the right lung and rightward shift of the mediastinal structures. Emphysematous changes are again seen. Pleural thickening along the right apical lateral chest is unchanged from the recent prior radiograph. Although there has been interval resolution of the previously noted mild pulmonary edema, a new focal consolidation overlying the mid left lung, concerning for infectious process is identified. Bibasilar opacities are again seen, likely secondary to atelectasis as well as small bilateral pleural effusions, are overall slightly improved compared to the prior exam. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes appear stable compared to the prior exam. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Several clips project over the upper thoracic spine and right lateral apex. Note is made of post thoracotomy changes on the right.
