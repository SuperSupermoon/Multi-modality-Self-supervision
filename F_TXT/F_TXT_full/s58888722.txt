Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Persistent calcifications in right superior mediastinum correlate with vascular calcifications on recent chest CTA. Worsening opacity in left retrocardiac area could reflect either atelectasis or developing infectious pneumonia. Minor atelectasis is present in the right upper lobe with associated slight elevation of the minor fissure. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, left greater than right.
