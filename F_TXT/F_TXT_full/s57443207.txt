Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes, accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Fullness of the hila and mild perihilar opacities may relate to mild fluid overload and/or crowding of vessels. No definite focal consolidation is seen. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
