As compared to the previous radiograph, the volume of the right hemithorax has increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. A plate-like atelectasis is seen along the minor fissure, extending laterally from the hilus that is enlarged and too dense, which is caused by the underlying neoplasm. The right main bronchus tracheal stent appears to be in correct position. Tracheostomy tube and left internal jugular vein catheter are constant. No evidence of pneumothorax. Unremarkable left lung.
