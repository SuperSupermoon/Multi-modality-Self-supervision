Left-sided chest tube is in place, with an apparent moderate-sized left basilar pneumothorax, manifested by hyperlucency in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen and a slightly deep costophrenic sulcus. The patient is markedly rotated towards the right, limiting assessment for mediastinal shift. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6 cm above the carina, left internal jugular vascular catheter tip terminates in the region of the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava, and a nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm. Allowing for rotation, cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance, with a markedly tortuous and potentially dilated descending thoracic aorta. Bibasilar areas of atelectasis are present as well as a possible layering right pleural effusion. Subcutaneous emphysema is present in the left chest wall.
