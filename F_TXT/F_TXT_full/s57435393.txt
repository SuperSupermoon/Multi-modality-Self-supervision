In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes which may account in part for the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Continued opacification at the left base is consistent with some combination of volume loss in the left lower lobe, pleural effusion, or superimposed pneumonia. No definite vascular congestion. Dermal and breast calcifications are again seen, consistent with the patient's mixed connective tissue disease.
