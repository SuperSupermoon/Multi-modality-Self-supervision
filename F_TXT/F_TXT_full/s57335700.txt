The lung volumes are low. This is accentuating the cardiomediastinal silhouette, although there is likely moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly. The mediastinum is prominent, which could be due to technique. A right internal jugular catheter is present with the tip in the low SVC. There is no pneumothorax. The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema. There is no pleural effusion.
