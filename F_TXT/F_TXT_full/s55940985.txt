As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. The patient has received a nasogastric tube. The tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach. The patient has also received a left-sided subclavian line. The tip projects over the confluence of the bracheocephalic vein and the superior vena cava. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Areas of atelectasis are visible at both lung bases.
