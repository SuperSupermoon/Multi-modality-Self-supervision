1. Left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the mid SVC. Lung volumes are slightly lower and there are moderate-sized layering bilateral effusions. There is overall worsening perihilar airspace disease with more confluent area on the left mid lung. Although this may represent worsening pulmonary edema, pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Clinical correlation is advised. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning. No pneumothorax. Bilateral shoulder prostheses incompletely visualized.
