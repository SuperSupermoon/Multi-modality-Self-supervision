Lung volumes are diminished with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature and no overt pulmonary edema. Prominent azygos vein suggests a fluid replete state. Endotracheal tube is in place with its tip 3.5 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular introducer remains in place with its tip in the proximal SVC and appears to be proximally kinked. Hardware is seen overlying the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine. Note is made of gastric distension.
