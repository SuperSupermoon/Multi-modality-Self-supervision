In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is some increased opacification at the left base most likely reflecting atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. The right IJ catheter remains in place. The nasogastric tube has been removed. Little change in the subcutaneous gas along the upper abdomen on the right.
