The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. The hila and pleura are unremarkable. Multifocal opacities are seen, right greater than left, suggestive of asymmetric pulmonary edema. A coalescing right lower lung opacity could represent a superimposed developing pneumonia. No pleural pneumothorax are seen.
