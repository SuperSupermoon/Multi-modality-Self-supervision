Portable AP radiograph was compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The Dobbhoff tube has been inserted, coiled within the distal esophagus and going up toward the oral cavity. The ET tube tip is at the level of the clavicular head, unchanged. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Interval progression of bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis has been demonstrated. The patient currently can be in mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
