The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position 5.4 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of field of view. A Swan-Ganz catheter is present, and since the prior exam, the tip is now pointing left toward, likely into the left main pulmonary artery. The opacities in the right upper lobe, and to a less extent, in the left upper lobe are more discrete appearing, suggesting the presence of pneumonia. There is still mild edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
