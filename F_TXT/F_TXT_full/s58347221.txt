In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. Right chest tube is again seen and there is no evidence of pneumothorax or appreciable right effusion. Moderate left effusion persists. Patchy areas of opacification at the right base again could reflect consolidation, as could opacification in the retrocardiac region. There is some volume loss in the left lower lobe and evidence of mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
