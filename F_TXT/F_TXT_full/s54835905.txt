AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination with patient in supine position obtained five hours earlier during the same day. The patient remains intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea some 6 cm above the level of the carina. Left-sided chest tube has been pulled back slightly and terminates now in paramediastinal position on the left side, some 6 cm below the apex region. An NG tube is also seen and reaches well below the diaphragm. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. In comparison with the next preceding study the, at that time, complete atelectasis of the right upper lobe has normalized and appropriate aeration of the area is now present. Linear densities laterally indicate the progress in resolution of the atelectasis. No new pulmonary abnormalities are present. In the left lower chest wall at the site of the chest tube, a loculated soft tissue emphysema is present that has increased since the preceding study.
