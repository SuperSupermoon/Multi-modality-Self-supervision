The lung volumes are normal. There is increased opacity in the right lower lung corresponding to a opacity overlying the lower thoracic spine on lateral views. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. A small right pleural effusion is possible however obscured by consolidation. No pneumomediastinum.
