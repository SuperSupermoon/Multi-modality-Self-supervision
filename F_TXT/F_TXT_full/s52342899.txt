AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study dated ___. Previously described cardiac enlargement appears unchanged. The same holds for the previously described right internal jugular approach central venous line terminating in the lower SVC. Successful right-sided thoracocentesis has resulted in elimination of right-sided basal effusion, now with clear visibility of diaphragmatic contours. The pulmonary vasculature in the right hemithorax does not appear congested, and there is no evidence of a post-procedure pneumothorax in the apical area. On the left side, the previously described pleural effusion obscuring the diaphragmatic structures remains rather unchanged. No new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are seen.
