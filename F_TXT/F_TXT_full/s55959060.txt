The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and left-sided pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Right PICC tip terminates in the region of the SVC. There are low lung volumes. The heart size remains moderate-to-severely enlarged, but the mediastinal contour appears stably widened. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema is present. Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis as does minimal linear opacity within the right lung base. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The right internal jugular central venous catheter has been removed.
