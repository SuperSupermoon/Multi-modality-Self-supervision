Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema persists, not significantly changed from the prior. There is probable pneumopericardium as well. Bibasilar opacities represent pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. A chest tube projects over the left hemithorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
