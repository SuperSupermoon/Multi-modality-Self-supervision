The mediastinum on this AP radiograph is likely within normal limits with minimal calcification of the aortic arch. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally suggestive of trace pleural effusions. Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures and bibasilar atelectasis. There is likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Known thyroid goiter causes mild narrowing of the upper airway. The known left upper lobe mass is not well seen on the current exam.
