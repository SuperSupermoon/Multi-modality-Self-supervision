Following placement of a right-sided chest tube, a right pleural effusion has substantially decreased in size with residual moderate effusion remaining, as well as a new small right apical pneumothorax. Right lung has partially reexpanded with residual atelectasis and/or consolidation in the mid and lower lung regions. Within the left lung, patchy and linear atelectasis is present in the left perihilar and retrocardiac regions. Note is also made of a right internal jugular central venous catheter, with tip terminating within the right atrium.
