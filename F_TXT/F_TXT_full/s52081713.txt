No previous images. There are intact midline sternal wires in this patient with aortic arch replacement. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 3.3 cm above the carina. Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the right pulmonary artery. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. Bilateral chest tubes with no evidence of pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes. Extensive retrocardiac opacification with silhouetting hemidiaphragm is consistent with left lower lobe collapse and pleural fluid. Streaks of atelectasis are seen at the right base. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, which is accentuated by the relatively low lung volumes. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
