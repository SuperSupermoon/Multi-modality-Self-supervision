CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. The ET tube, NG tube, and left IJ central line are essentially unchanged. Again seen is prominence of the upper tracheal air column, which can be associated with prominent inflation of the cuff. Again seen are diffuse opacities in both lungs. However, there is suggestion of slight clearing in the right lung. Otherwise, no significant change.
