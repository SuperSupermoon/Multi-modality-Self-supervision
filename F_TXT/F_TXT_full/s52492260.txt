Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Lungs are clear except for minimal crowding of bronchovascular structures at the lung bases related to slightly low lung volumes. No evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Distended bowel in the upper abdomen is a nonspecific finding that is likely been more fully assessed by recent abdominal and pelvic CT from earlier the same date.
