The tracheostomy tube is in satisfactory position with the tip approximately 4.2 cm from the carina. A left subclavian central venous catheter is in unchanged position. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. Sternal wires are intact. Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower, which accentuates the bronchovascular structures. Moderate elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with associated atelectasis is stable. A new left perihilar and lower lung zone opacity is present. There is no overt pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
