Single frontal view of the chest. Multiple wires external to the patient limits evaluation of the left lung base. Heart size and mediastinal contours are stable. Lung volumes remain very low. Bibasilar opacities have slightly increased since the prior exam and are very symmetric with sharply distinct margins, entirely consistent with atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
