AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at ___. Heart size and mediastinum are overall stable. Prominence of the azygos vein is noted which is most likely a combination of lymph nodes and dilated azygos vein as demonstrated on the ___ chest CT. Lungs are overall clear. A note is made on the other hand of the left lower lobe opacity, slightly less pronounced than on the prior study but still concerning for atelectasis. Potentially might reflect a sequela of atelectasis due to elevated left hemidiaphragm. There is no pneumothorax.
