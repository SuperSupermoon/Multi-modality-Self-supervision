Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in place, including a left chest tube and left pigtail pleural catheter. There has been apparent slight change in position of the left pigtail pleural catheter including the extrapleural component projecting lateral to the lower left ribs. A moderate left pneumothorax is present with both apical and basilar components. Although the apical component is unchanged, the basilar component appears more prominent than on the prior study. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Multifocal abnormalities throughout the right lung have slightly worsened, and a confluent opacity at the left base is also worse in the interval. These findings likely represent progressive multifocal pneumonia, although co-existing atelectasis is also evident in the right lower lobe. Right-sided loculated pleural fluid and/or thickening appears unchanged. Finally, note is made of a right PICC, terminating within the right subclavian vein just beyond the junction with the right axillary vein.
