The endotracheal tube tip sits 5 cm above the carina. A left-sided IJ central venous catheter tip sits in the left brachiocephalic vein. The right-sided IJ central venous catheter tip sits in the upper SVC. The heart size is large but stable. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. There continue to be bibasilar and perihilar opacities as well as a more rounded confluent opacity in the right upper lung. These findings likely represent increased pulmonary edema as well as right upper and lower lobe consolidations. Retrocardiac opacity is also compatible with a left lower lobe consolidation. The costophrenic angles are excluded from the study limiting assessment for subtle pleural effusion. There is no large pneumothorax.
