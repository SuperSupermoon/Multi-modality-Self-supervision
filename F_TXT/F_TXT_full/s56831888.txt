Indwelling devices remain in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged in appearance. Post-operative volume loss is present in right hemithorax consistent with a known right middle lobe resection. Small right pleural effusion and adjacent right basilar atelectasis appear similar to recent study. Poorly defined opacities at the left lung base are unchanged, and may be due to atelectasis or pneumonia. Adjacent small left effusion is again demonstrated.
