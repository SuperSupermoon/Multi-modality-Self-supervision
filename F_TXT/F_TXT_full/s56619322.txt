The ET tube terminates approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. There is an enteric tube which extends below the diaphragm with the tip in the body of the stomach. A Swan-Ganz catheter is in unchanged position, ending in the pulmonary outflow tract. A right internal jugular vein is in appropriate position. Moderate cardiomegaly is persistent. There is perihilar perivascular congestion with moderate pulmonary edema, similar to the prior exam. Again noted is a retrocardiac opacity which may be concerning for pneumonia. No evidence of pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
