CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW The tracheal air column is not well defined and the etiology for this opacification remains uncertain. The appearance is similar to ___ at 18:38 p.m. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm overlying stomach. A mediastinal drain is present. A right IJ central line is present, tip over distal SVC. A linear opacity overlies the upper cardiac silhouette to the right of the spine, unchanged compared with ___. Multiple rings and surgical clips overlie the mediastinum. There is mild cardiomegaly, unchanged, with slight ill-definition of the mediastinal contours. There is patchy opacity at both lung bases. Known bullous changes likely account for the rounded lucency at the left cardiac apex. Allowing for this, no pneumothorax is detected.
