The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Low lung volumes are present. The heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is diffuse gaseous distention of bowel loops as well as the stomach within the upper abdomen. Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is noted with degenerative changes identified in both glenohumeral joints.
