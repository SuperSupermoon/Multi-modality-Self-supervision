In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the degree of apical pneumothorax is more prominent, though still relatively small. The diffuse opacification of the hemi thoraces is much less, consistent with improvement in pleural effusion, though it is much of this could be related to a more erect position of the patient. More focal opacification is again seen in the right upper zone. Pulmonary vascular congestion is relatively mild.
