Compared to earlier the same day, no definite change is detected. There is equivocal slight coarsening of the pulmonary markings in the mid zones bilaterally. Again seen is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The background COPD. No pneumothorax detected. Incidental note again made of a calcified granuloma in the left lung apex.
