As compared to chest radiograph from 1 day prior, endotracheal tube is 3 cm from the carina, left IJ catheter in the left brachiocephalic vein. Nasogastric tube in good position. Worsening retrocardiac opacity likely worsening atelectasis. Bilateral mild to moderate effusions and basilar opacities have not substantially changed given for differences in patient positioning. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
