Single lead left-sided pacer remains in place. A left internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal brachiocephalic vein near its junction with the SVC. There is improved aeration at the right lung apex but persistent consolidation in the right mid and lower lung with probable associated layering effusion. In addition, there is persistent retrocardiac consolidation with an associated effusion. The pulmonary edema has improved. Findings are most consistent with atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. Heart remains stably enlarged. No pneumothorax.
