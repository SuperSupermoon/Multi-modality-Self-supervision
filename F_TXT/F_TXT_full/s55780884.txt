The heart is normal in size. There is moderate unfolding of the aorta, which is also tortuous. The right upper mediastinal margin appears convexed and thickened. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Moderate degenerative changes involve the left shoulder, including narrowing of the acromiohumeral interval and moderate osteoarthritis involving acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joints. Degenerative changes are also suspected on the right side, particularly narrowing of the glenohumeral joint, but the area is not completely imaged.
