Tracheostomy tube remains in place in standard position. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Lung volumes remain low which exaggerates the heart size and pulmonary vasculature although there appears to be residual mild pulmonary edema. There is focal consolidation in the extreme right lung base which may be secondary to atelectasis however infection cannot be excluded. There is no large pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. An upper enteric tube remains in position with the tip excluded from imaging.
