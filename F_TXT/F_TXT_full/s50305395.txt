As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac silhouette has moderately increased. In addition, there is an increase in diameter of the pulmonary vasculature as well as a newly appeared retrocardiac atelectasis. Overall, the findings are suggestive of mild to moderate pulmonary edema. There is currently no evidence of pneumonia. No pneumothorax. No larger pleural effusions.
