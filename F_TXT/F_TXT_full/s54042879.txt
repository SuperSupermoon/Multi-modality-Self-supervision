AP chest compared to ___: Following right thoracentesis, moderate volume right pleural effusion has reaccumulated. Lateral distribution suggests it could be loculated. There is no pneumothorax, or left pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette is slightly larger today than before which may be a function of paramediastinal pleural fluid rather than real change in the heart size or the accumulation of pericardial fluid. Right lung base is understandably atelectatic. Remainder of the lungs clear. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is chronic.
