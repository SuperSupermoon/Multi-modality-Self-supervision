AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Again a right-sided PICC line can be identified on high contrast copy of the image. The line is seen to terminate overlying the carina. This is compatible with the mid portion of the SVC, which appears to be identical in comparison with the previous study. The contrast of the line is very poor; it may be advised to check free flow in the line to confirm its appropriate intravascular position.
