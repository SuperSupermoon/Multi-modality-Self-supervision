As compared to the previous radiograph, the course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged. The tip of the tube projects 2-3 cm below the gastroesophageal junction and could be slightly advanced. The lung volumes continue to be low, and the cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Mild pulmonary edema is seen, and the image is not changed as compared to the previous comparison. Coronary stent is again visualized. No pleural effusions. No pneumonia, minimal atelectasis at the left lung bases.
