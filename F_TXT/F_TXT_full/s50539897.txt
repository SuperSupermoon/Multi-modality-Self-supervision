Tip of the new endotracheal tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles approximately 10 cm of the carina from the carina and should be advanced 5 cm for more secure seating. Left lower lobe is collapsed. Lungs are otherwise clear. Pleural effusion is small on the left if any. Heart size normal. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach would need to be advanced at least 10 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
