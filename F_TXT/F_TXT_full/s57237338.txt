AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Small right pleural effusion has decreased. There is no obvious right pneumothorax. What looks to be increased consolidation in the right lower lobe, perhaps atelectasis or perhaps concurrent pneumonia. Left hemidiaphragm is higher today than before, suggesting this study may have been taken in partial expiration, which would contribute to right lower lobe atelectasis. Upper lungs are clear. Thoracic aorta is generally large and tortuous, but unchanged and not focally aneurysmal. Mild cardiac enlargement is exaggerated by AP orientation and lower lung volumes.
