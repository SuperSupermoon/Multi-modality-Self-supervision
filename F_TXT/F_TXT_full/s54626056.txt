Opacities seen at the right lung base are presumably atelectasis, although given the provided clinical history, a contusion would be difficult to exclude. Pneumonia would also have to be considered in the correct clinical setting. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. There is no displaced rib fracture. An old-appearing fracture of the left distal clavicle is noted.
