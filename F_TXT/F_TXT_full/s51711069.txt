As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Constant position of the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube. Moderate cardiomegaly with substantial retrocardiac atelectasis persists. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. However, no newly appeared parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia is visualized.
