Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged with enlargement of the pulmonary arteries, better assessed on the previous CT, compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension. There is upper zone vascular redistribution without overt pulmonary edema. Chronic interstitial opacities are again noted predominantly along the periphery and lung bases with bronchiectasis also noted in the lower lobes. Patchy ill-defined opacities are re- demonstrated in both lower lung fields as well as within the upper lobes bilaterally, more so on the right. Overall, the findings within the left lung base and left upper lobe appear minimally improved, with the opacities in the right lung base perhaps slightly worse. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Remote left-sided rib rib fractures are again seen.
