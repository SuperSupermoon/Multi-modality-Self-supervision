A left pectoral pacemaker with single lead terminating in the right ventricle is unchanged. The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple intact appearing wires. Mediastinal surgical clips are compatible with prior CABG surgery. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged but stable. The right mediastinal contour is prominent in part related to unfolding of the thoracic aorta, which is unchanged. There is calcification of the aortic knob. There is decreased engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature and improved ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs suggesting resolving CHF. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
