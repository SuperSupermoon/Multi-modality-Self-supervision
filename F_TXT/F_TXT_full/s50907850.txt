Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to previous study obtained at 6:52 p.m. The ET tube tip is approximately 10 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach and should be advanced. The right internal jugular line is in unchanged position. Bullous disease in the both apices is noted and unlikely to reflect pneumothorax.
