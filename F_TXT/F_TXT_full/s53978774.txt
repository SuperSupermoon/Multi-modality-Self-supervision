Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier. Small right and moderate left pleural effusions are unchanged. Cardiac size is top normal. Partially obscured by the pleural parenchymal abnormalities. Patient has known emphysema. Left upper lobe and left lower lobe consolidations are unchanged. Right lower lobe opacity is a combination of pleural effusion atelectasis. In the left, infection is most likely present. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Right PICC tip is in the proximal SVC. Enteric tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
