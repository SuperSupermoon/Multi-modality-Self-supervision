The endotracheal tube is unchanged, ending 2.2 cm above the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. Peribronchial opacities in the bilateral lung bases may represent layering small bilateral pleural effusions but followup with conventional radiographs when feasible is recommended. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
