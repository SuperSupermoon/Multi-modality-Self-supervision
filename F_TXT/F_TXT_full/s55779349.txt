There has been interval complete opacification of the left hemithorax which likely represents a combination of a worsening pleural effusion and lobar collapse, possibly secondary to a mucous plug or increasing effusion. The right lung remains well inflated with prominent interstitium likely reflecting mild interstitial edema. Patient is status post median sternotomy. A tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. The cardiac and mediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to the left hemithorax being opacified.
