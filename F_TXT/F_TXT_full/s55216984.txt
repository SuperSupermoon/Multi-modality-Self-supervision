Compared to earlier the same day at 12:53 p.m. and allowing for technical differences, the degree of opacity at the right base may be slightly increased. The degree of opacity at the left lung apex is also increased. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. As before, there is truncation of the left-sided airway, though this occurs slightly more proximal now at the distal left main stem bronchus, with near-complete opacification of the left lung, notably worse in the left lung apex than it was on the prior film. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured. The right lung shows background COPD with patchy opacity and possible pleural fluid/thickening at the right base, which also appears slightly worse compared with the prior film. Allowing for patient rotation, the trachea remains midline. An area of focal expansion of the trachea immediately above the aortic knob is suggested, probably unchanged. There is mild vascular plethora visualized in the aerated portion of the right upper lung, but otherwise, no definite evidence of CHF.
