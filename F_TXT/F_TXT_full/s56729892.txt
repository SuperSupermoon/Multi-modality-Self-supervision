As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a decrease in lung volumes with unchanged position of the monitoring and support devices. Also, there could be a slight increase in extent of the known extensive left pleural effusion and subsequent areas of atelectasis, notably at the left lung bases and the retrocardiac lung areas. In the right lung, there is no relevant change. Coils projecting over the left upper quadrant are constant.
