Lordotic positioning. Low inspiratory volumes. Allowing for technique, the heart size is borderline enlarged. There is atelectasis the left lung base laterally, with blunting of costophrenic angle raising the possibility of a small left effusion. No CHF, other focal infiltrate, or right-sided effusion. No pneumothorax detected. Linear radiodensity in the right paratracheal region is again seen, question vascular calcification. Mild prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissues is noted, but could relate to paramediastinal fat, accentuated by known collaterals and lordotic positioning.
