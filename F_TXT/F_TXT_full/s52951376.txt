A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a left chest wall pacer device with the single lead overlying the right ventricle, unchanged in position. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged, as is retrocardiac opacity which is likely related to atelectasis and possible small left pleural effusion. No definite focal consolidation is identified. Moderate pulmonary edema is persistent, but improved compared to the prior radiograph. There is no pneumothorax.
