Support lines and tubes are unchanged in position. The tip of the endotracheal tube remains low, 2 cm above the carina. The ETT could be pulled back slightly for more optimal placement. There is unchanged cardiomegaly. There is diffuse subcutaneous emphysema along the chest, stable. This limits evaluation of the lung parenchyma. Allowing for this, there appears to be improved aeration. There remains a left retrocardiac opacity and small bilateral effusions.
