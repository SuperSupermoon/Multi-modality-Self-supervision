Within the limitations of technique, the cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear probably unchanged. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is similar and accordingly is probably due to scarring in the costophrenic sulcus rather than a pleural effusion. There is no convincing evidence for a substantial pleural effusion on either side. There is no pneumothorax. The lungs appear clear.
