Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is in part due to the AP technique and supine positioning. Lung volumes are low. Persistent opacification of the left base probably represents atelectasis however superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded. The right lung is clear. There is increased pulmonary vascular engorgement, but no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
