AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided. A retrocardiac opacity containing gas is compatible with a large hiatal hernia. Calcified nodular opacities in the left mid lung are most compatible with calcified granulomas and appear unchanged. Coarsened reticular markings within the right mid lung appear slightly more confluent as compared with prior exam and could reflect scarring. No convincing evidence of pneumonia or aspiration. No definite pneumothorax or effusion. The heart size appears grossly preserved. The mediastinal contour is unchanged with calcified unfolded thoracic aorta again noted. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
