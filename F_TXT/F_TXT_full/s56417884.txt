ET tube, NG tube, and right-sided PICC line are similar in position. Fixation hardware in the lower cervical spine is noted, not fully evaluated. Allowing for low inspiratory volumes and lordotic positioning, the overall appearance is similar. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. There is CHF, with vascular plethora and blurring. There is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and or consolidation. A small left effusion cannot be excluded.
