Portable supine chest radiograph was obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of thoracic inlet, 5.4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach. The lungs are low in volume, giving the appearance of bronchovascular crowding. Bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflect atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified on this supine film. The heart and mediastinum appear unremarkable. Non-displaced right second rib fracture is seen. Possible right clavicular fracture with periosteal reaction is noted distally.
