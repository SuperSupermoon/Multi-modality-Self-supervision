In unchanged manner, there is increased radiodensity of the right lung, with blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small right pleural effusion. The size of the cardiac silhouette is normal. Unchanged bilateral perihilar and right apical areas of scarring, combined to bilateral symmetrical apical thickening. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
