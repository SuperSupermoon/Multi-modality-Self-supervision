AP chest compared to 4:03 p.m.: There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion despite multiple left rib fractures, and a nondisplaced clavicle fracture. Cardiomediastinal silhouette has been stable since earlier in the day when torso CT showed no mediastinal bleeding. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is probably due to volume resuscitation. Gaseous distention of the stomach is still present. Very small amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral abdominal wall is not necessarily clinically significant.
