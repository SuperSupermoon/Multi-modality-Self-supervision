A new endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.2 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube is noted which terminates below the left hemidiaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film,. Lung volumes are low. Heart size appears moderately enlarged. Widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to supine technique and low lung volumes. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No overt pulmonary edema is noted. Retrocardiac hazy opacity may reflect atelectasis. A small left pleural effusion may be present. No pneumothorax is identified.
