Left-sided central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes. Patchy right basilar opacity likely represent atelectasis given that it was not present 7 hr earlier. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, better appreciated on pre seeding CT. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged, accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes. Mediastinal contours are stable.
