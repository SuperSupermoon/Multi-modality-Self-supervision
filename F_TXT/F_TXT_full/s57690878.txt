As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. There is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly at low lung volumes, but evidence suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is more tangible than on the previous image. Small bilateral pleural effusions could be present. There is relatively extensive bilateral basal atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax.
