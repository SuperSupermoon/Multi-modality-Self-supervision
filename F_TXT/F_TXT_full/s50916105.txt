As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the Dobbhoff tube and the endotracheal tube, are in unchanged position. The bilateral parenchymal opacities, documented on multiple previous films, are unchanged in overall severity and overall extent. However, likely caused by positional changes of the patient, the opacities are appearing slightly denser on the left and slightly less dense on the right. In addition, mild bilateral blunting of the costophrenic sinuses might suggest the presence of pleural effusions. Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
