Since the prior study, the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes have been removed. Bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal tube are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. There is a poor inspiratory effort making evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal silhouette difficult. There is no CHF or dense consolidation. There is linear atelectasis in both lung bases.
