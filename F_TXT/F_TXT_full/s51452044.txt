Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles no less than 6.5 cm from the carina an should be advanced to 2 3 cm for more secure seating. Upper enteric drainage tube has been partially withdrawn and would need to be advanced 15 cm to move all the side ports well into the stomach, which is now moderately distended. Supine positioning and very low lung volumes account in part for apparent increase in diameter of the cardiac silhouette, but clinical consideration should be given to the possibility of any developing pericardial fluid collection. There is no venous engorgement in the mediastinum to suggest that pericardial fluid if present is hemodynamically significant. Right upper lobe hematoma more readily visible than earlier, but not appreciably larger. There may be an increase in the small right pleural effusion. Left lung is clear. Subcutaneous emphysema and bullet fragments in the right chest wall are unchanged.
