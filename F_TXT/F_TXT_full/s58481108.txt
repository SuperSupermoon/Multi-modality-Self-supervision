In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued atelectatic changes at the right base. The opacification at the left base is slightly more prominent, which could reflect some increasing pleural fluid and volume loss in the lower lobe. No definite acute focal pneumonia, though this would be very difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
