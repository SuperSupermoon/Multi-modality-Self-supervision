Compared to the radiograph obtained approximately 8 hours prior, lung volumes are lower. Opacification of the left hemithorax has increased, possibly positional given exaggerated lordotic view. Multiple bulla are now better appreciated, the largest of which located at the left lung apex. The right hemithorax opacities are essentially unchanged, likely a combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid. Prior right rib fractures are again seen.
