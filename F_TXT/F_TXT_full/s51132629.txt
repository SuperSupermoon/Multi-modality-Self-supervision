RADIOGRAPHIC WORSENING OF THE SMALL REGION OF RIGHT LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA IS PROBABLY DUE TO VOLUME SHIFT RATHER THAN A PROGRESSION OF INFECTION. LARGER AREA OF CONSOLIDATION IN THE LEFT LOWER LUNG EXTENDING TO THE LINGULA HAS NOT IMPROVED. LARGE HEART AND MEDIASTINAL WIDENING, DUE TO ADENOPATHY, ARE ALL LONG-STANDING FEATURES. ET TUBE, LEFT INTERNAL JUGULAR LINE, AND NASOGASTRIC DRAINAGE TUBE ARE IN STANDARD PLACEMENTS RESPECTIVELY. NO PNEUMOTHORAX.
