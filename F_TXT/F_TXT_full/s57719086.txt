Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and is slightly decreased in width compared to the prior study, along with decreased width of the vascular pedicle, and less engorgement of the pulmonary vessels. Asymmetrical pattern of combined alveolar and interstitial edema has slightly changed in distribution, but overall severity is not appreciably changed. Bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis also appear similar.
