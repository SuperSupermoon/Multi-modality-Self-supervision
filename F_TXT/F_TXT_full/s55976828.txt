Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours in this patient with known mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Lungs remain well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Faint opacity in the periphery of the left upper lobe likely corresponds to a mass seen on CT dated ___. The other of lung nodules seen on CT are not well appreciated on plain radiograph. Deformity of the right midclavicle consistent with prior fracture.
