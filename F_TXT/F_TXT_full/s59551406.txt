1. Interval placement of a right subclavian PICC line which has its tip in the mid to distal SVC. Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube, and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. Lung volumes remain somewhat diminished and there continue to be patchy bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, which may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
