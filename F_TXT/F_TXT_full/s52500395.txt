Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is smaller today than on ___ following thoracentesis. There is no pneumothorax. Absence of leftward mediastinal shift on either study shows an equivalent volume of atelectasis, not a feature of an acute effusion. Depending on the profile of the pleural effusion, additional imaging either of the chest or right upper abdominal quadrant or both will be indicated. Small bulge in the contour of the descending thoracic aorta could be due to aneurysm or adenopathy, and warrants contrast-enhanced chest CTA. Heart is top normal size. Left lung is grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax on either side. Dr. ___ was paged at 11:15 a.m. when the findings were recognized.
