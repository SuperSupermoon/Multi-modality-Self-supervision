Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. The most recent prior study available is chest CT from ___. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Slight left mediastinal shift is demonstrated that potentially might be related to atelectasis, but small amount of left pleural effusion is also seen. Biapical pleural thickening is noted. It appears to be more pronounced than on the prior chest CT from ___, in particular on the right, although no definite mass is noted. If clinically warranted, correlation with chest CT might be considered. No pneumothorax is seen.
