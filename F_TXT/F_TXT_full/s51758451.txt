Supine portable AP view the chest provided. Lung volumes are low limiting assessment. In this patient with a known right diaphragmatic eventration, a double density at the right lower lung is reflective of this. There is bibasilar atelectasis without large pleural effusion. Heart size is difficult to assess. Mediastinal contour appears grossly unremarkable. No convincing signs of overt edema or pneumonia when interpreted in conjunction with same-day CT abdomen pelvis.
