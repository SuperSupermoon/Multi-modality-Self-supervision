Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates an enlarged cardiac silhouette. The right internal jugular catheter is in unchanged position. A left-sided 2 lead pacemaker also remains unchanged. There is persistent indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature and bilateral hazy opacities, not significantly changed since the most recent study. Bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis are also unchanged. No definite focal consolidation is identified.
