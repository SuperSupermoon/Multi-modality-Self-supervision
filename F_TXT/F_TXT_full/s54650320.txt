In comparison to the most recent prior, a left internal jugular central venous catheter has been placed. The catheter terminates in the mid SVC. Again noted are low lung volumes. No new focal consolidation is identified. There is no pneumothorax. Again seen is a possible diffusion on the right, unchanged since the prior examination. The cardiac silhouette is borderline enlarged and the pulmonary vascularity is indistinct, which may be suggestive of mild edema.
