As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient shows an almost unchanged picture. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Newly appeared blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting minimal right pleural effusion. Unchanged appearance of the remaining lung parenchyma. Unchanged right internal jugular vein catheter without evidence of pneumothorax, with the tip projecting over the right atrium.
