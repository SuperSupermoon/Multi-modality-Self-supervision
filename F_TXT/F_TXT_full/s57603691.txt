The heart size is mild mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable allowing for patient rotation. Persistent opacity within the left lower lobe is demonstrated with likely a small sized left pleural effusion. There is a new perihilar haziness and peribronchial cuffing in the left upper lobe, suggestive of asymmetric moderate pulmonary edema. Small right pleural effusion is demonstrated. No focal consolidation is noted in the right lung though there is atelectasis at the right lower lobe. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
