There is little change compared to prior examination with redemonstration of a left-sided apical chest tube without pneumothorax. A left-sided ICD remains in unchanged position. There is a demonstration of mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of fluid overload or interstitial edema. Lung volume remains slightly low with bibasilar atelectasis. There is persistent tiny right-sided pleural effusion.
