A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged position with the tip in the distal SVC. Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position with the tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. Heart remains stably enlarged. The perihilar edema has improved. However, there is persistent consolidation in the retrocardiac region likely representing lower lobe collapse in the setting of a small layering left effusion.
