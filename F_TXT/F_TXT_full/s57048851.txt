Portable AP upright view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior study. Bowel gas extends from the right abdomen through the mediastinum and into the thoracic inlet and represents a colonic conduit from prior esophagectomy. Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities located predominantly in the right upper lung and lingula are relatively unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema, abscess, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Right and left calcified pleural plaques located over the hemidiaphragms are from prior asbestos or talc pleuradesis. A left pectoral bi-electrode pacer's leads end in the right atrium and right ventricular apex respectively.
