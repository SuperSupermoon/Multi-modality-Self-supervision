Single frontal portable radiograph demonstrates a left subclavian approach central venous catheter with tip in cavobrachiocephalic junction. An enteric tube traverses inferiorly out of view. The lung volumes remain low, accentuating massive enlargement of cardiac silhouette, which could reflect a component of a failure and/or pericardial effusion. Perivascular congestion is mildly improved. Right upper lung opacity is re-demonstrated, compatible with underlying chronic apical mass. Left lower lobe consolidation is re-demonstrated, likely associated with a component of atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are not excluded.
