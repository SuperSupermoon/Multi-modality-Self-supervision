Comparison is made to prior study from ___. Study is very limited due to the overlying wires which obscure the chest and the heart. There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is approximately 3 cm above the carina. There is an enteric tube whose tip is not well seen but below the edge of the film. Heart size is enlarged. There is a mild improvement of the pulmonary edema since the prior study. There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity.
