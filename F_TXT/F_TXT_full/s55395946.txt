The intra-aortic balloon pump ends 2.2 cm below the aortic knob and 1.8 cm above the left mainstem which is adequate but should not be higher. Right-sided Swan-Ganz has been slightly pulled back and now ends in the right pulmonary artery. Moderate pulmonary edema, more localized in the right upper lobe may be due to mitral valve regurgitation. Prior sternotomy was done for mitral valve repair in this patient with significant cardiomegaly. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. New 18 mm very dense opacity is seen in the left upper quadrant, probably in the stomach which could represent ingested pill or even a tooth.
