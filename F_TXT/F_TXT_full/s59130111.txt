Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates a right internal jugular catheter with tip projecting over mid SVC. No pneumothorax. Endotracheal and orogastric tubes are appropriately positioned, unchanged. Low lung volumes. Slight blunting of costophrenic angles, compatible with small trace pleural effusions. There are bilateral diffuse confluent airspace opacities, right greater than left, slightly worse in the interval. There is thickening of the right minor fissure. Heart size is normal. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.
