As compared to the previous radiograph, the amount of right-sided pleural fluid is virtually unchanged. The pre-existing right lower lung parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting the presence of atelectasis, is constant. The ventilation of the left lung base appears to have increased. Better than on the previous radiograph, today's image gives evidence of an increase in radiodensity of the right-sided aspects of the mediastinum, with partial obliteration of the paratracheal stripe. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Borderline size of the heart.
