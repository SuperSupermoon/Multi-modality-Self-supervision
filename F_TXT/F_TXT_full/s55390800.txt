As compared to the previous radiograph and to the CT exam performed on ___, there obviously has been tapping of a pre-existing large right pleural effusion. Effusion is almost completely resolved. There is no right-sided pneumothorax. The extensive ill-defined parenchymal opacities on the left documented on yesterday's CT examination, are constant in appearance. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No new parenchymal opacities. Normal hilar and mediastinal structures.
