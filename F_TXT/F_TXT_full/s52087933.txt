Multi focal pneumonia continues to clear, particularly in the right upper lobe. Both lower lobes are still substantially consolidated. Pleural effusion is small if any. Heart size top-normal. Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 8 cm from the carina. The chin is in neutral or elevation, and therefore the tube should be advanced no more than 3 cm. Right jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC, left jugular line in the low SVC. Nasogastric drainage tube passes into a nondistended stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
