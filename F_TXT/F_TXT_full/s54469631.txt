Since yesterday's exam, endotracheal tube has been placed with tip seen approximately 4.1 cm from the carina. Left-sided central venous catheter tip projects over the right atrium as on prior. Left PICC tip projects over the axilla as on yesterday's exam. Enteric tube tip projects over the stomach, side-port just past the GE junction. Left pleural effusion is noted with retrocardiac opacity may be due to atelectasis. There is also likely a small right pleural effusion. There is pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
