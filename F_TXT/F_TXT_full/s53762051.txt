Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina. Central venous catheter and feeding tube remain in standard position. Heart size remains normal. Pulmonary vascular engorgement persists, but there is an improving combined alveolar and interstitial pattern bilaterally, likely due to improving pulmonary edema, which remains worse on the left than the right. Worsening left lower lobe atelectasis is present as well as a persistent small left pleural effusion. Small right pleural effusion is also unchanged.
