Bilateral chest tubes are present, both projecting over the region of the lung apices. Endotracheal tube remains in standard position. Orogastric tube is seen with tip coursing below the diaphragm, within the stomach, though the side port is above the gastroesophageal junction should be advanced by at least 5 cm. Left subclavian catheter tip appears to be malpositioned, terminating at the region of the aortic knob, and is likely intra-arterial. Remainder of the chest is unchanged. Persistent dense consolidation within the retrocardiac region is noted with a moderate left hemothorax. There is continued oblong lucency overlying the cardiac silhouette compatible with a left pneumothorax. Deep sulcus sign on the right is incompletely imaged, and compatible with a small right pneumothorax. Multiple bilateral rib fractures are again seen.
