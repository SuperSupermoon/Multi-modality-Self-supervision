A medial right basilar opacity has fully resolved. A left retrocardiac opacity has mostly resolved, leaving slight patchy residual opacity with volume loss at the left lung base. There is a possible residual pleural effusion on the left side, probably small. There may also be a trace right-sided pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, allowing for increased leftward rotation on this study.
