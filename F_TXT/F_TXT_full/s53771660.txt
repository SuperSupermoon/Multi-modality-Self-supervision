The masslike airspace opacity at the right hilum has improved slightly in appearance. Ring shadows in the right upper lobe are more prominent than on the prior study but similar in degree when compared to an earlier study from ___. These likely reflect background changes of cystic fibrosis. There is improved aeration of the left lung with consequent improved visualization of airspace opacity at the left lung base. No pneumothorax seen.
