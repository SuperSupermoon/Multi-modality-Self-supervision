In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the right chest tube has been placed and there has been some increase in the expansion of the right lung. There is still evidence of pneumothorax and probably some residual pleural fluid. No air-fluid level is appreciated, since this is not an upright view. Subcutaneous gas is seen adjacent to the lower right chest and upper abdomen.
