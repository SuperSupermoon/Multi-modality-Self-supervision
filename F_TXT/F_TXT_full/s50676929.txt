AP chest compared to ___: Left hemidiaphragm is no longer elevated, presumably reflecting either improvement in intestinal distention or remission of previously unrecognized left lower lobe atelectasis. Lungs are clear aside from a small cylindrical opacity in the right mid lung laterally which could be either atelectasis or tiny mucoid impaction. Pleural effusion is insignificant, if any. The heart is normal size. This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.
