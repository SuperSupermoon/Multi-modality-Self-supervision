Overall, no significant interval change other than perhaps slight interval increase in left lower lobe atelectasis with left shift of the mediastinum. The known common tiny left apical pneumothorax persists, grossly unchanged in size since yesterday. The left PleurX catheter tip projects over the left lower thorax within the moderate-sized left pleural effusion, which is overall also similar in size. Associated compressive atelectasis persists. Opacity in left lateral lung, corresponding to the known malignancy is unchanged. Increased interstitial markings, particularly on the left are unchanged, reflecting edema and/or possible lymphangitic spread. No change in the radiographic appearance of the right lung. No right pleural effusion.
