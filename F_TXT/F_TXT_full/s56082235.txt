A new right internal central jugular venous catheter terminates at the upper superior vena cava. There is no evidence for pneumothorax. The heart is moderately enlarged, as before, and the patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. There is new patchy opacification of the left lung base, suspected to represent a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. The right lung remains clear.
