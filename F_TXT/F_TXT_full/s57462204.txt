Study is slightly limited due to patient rotation. Tracheostomy tube tip is in standard position terminating approximately 7.6 cm from the carina. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette size is limited due to rotation. The aorta may be slightly tortuous. There is minimal streaky opacity in the left lung base, likely reflective of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is visualized. Degenerative changes within both glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints appear mild. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
