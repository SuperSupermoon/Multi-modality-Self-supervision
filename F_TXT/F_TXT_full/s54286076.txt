Right PICC remains in place, and has apparently been withdrawn or re-positioned in the interval, now terminating in the right brachiocephalic vein and previously within the upper superior vena cava. Exam otherwise appears similar to the recent study except for development of a patchy opacity in the right lung base, which may be due to patchy atelectasis, focal aspiration, or a developing area of infection. Followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
