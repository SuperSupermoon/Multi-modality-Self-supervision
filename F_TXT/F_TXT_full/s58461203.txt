Low lung volumes are present. A right perihilar opacity appears to have increased in size compared to the prior study, likely reflecting the patient's known lung malignancy. There are ill-defined bibasilar somewhat consolidative opacities, new in the interval. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic. There is a small right pleural effusion, and likely a trace left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no frank pulmonary edema is identified. Evaluation the heart size is difficult given the presence of bibasilar airspace opacities. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
