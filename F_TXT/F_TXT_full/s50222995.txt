A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Increased perihilar opacities and Kerley B lines are compatible with pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, similar to prior studies. The right costophrenic sulcus is not well seen, possibly due to a small right pleural effusion. There is no left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Aortic knob calcifications are again seen. Hardware in the left humeral head, incompletely evaluated on this study. The left humeral head is not seated in the glenohumeral joint and appears more displaced than on ___ and definitely more displaced than on ___. Some of the difference may be due to differences in patient position.
