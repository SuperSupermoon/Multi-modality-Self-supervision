As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The Swan-Ganz catheter is in almost unchanged position, with the tip too far in the right pulmonary arterial system. As previously recommended, the catheter should be pulled back by approximately 4 cm. The lung volumes have improved, the size of the cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged and there are almost unchanged signs indicative of mild pulmonary edema.
