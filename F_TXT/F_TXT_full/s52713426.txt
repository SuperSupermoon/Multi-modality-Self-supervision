Tracheostomy tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. Two right subclavian PICC lines are seen, one with the tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction and the other of which is in the proximal subclavian vein. Left chest tube is unchanged in position. There has been interval decrease in the amount of subcutaneous emphysema within the left lateral chest wall. There is a small residual but stable left apical pneumothorax. There is increased indistinctness of the pulmonary vascularity, which suggests superimposed component of mild interstitial edema. Probable small layering bilateral effusions. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient positioning. The mid clavicular fracture and fracture of the left second anterior rib is again noted. The other described fractures of the left third and fourth anterior ribs and a nondisplaced fracture of the sternum are not appreciated on the plain film study.
