The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Moderate pulmonary edema is not substantially changed compared to the prior exam. Calcified pleural plaques, more pronounced within the right hemithorax, are re- demonstrated, with continued bibasilar airspace opacification, worse in the right lung base. Overall, these findings appear similar compared to the prior exam. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted, and there is persistent chronic consolidation of the left upper lobe. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
