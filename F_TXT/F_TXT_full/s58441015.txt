A right chest port is present with tip in the cavoatrial junction. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax. The lungs are well expanded. Right upper lobe opacity abutting the major fissure is consistent with pneumonia. Additional opacity at the left lung base may also represent an infectious process.
