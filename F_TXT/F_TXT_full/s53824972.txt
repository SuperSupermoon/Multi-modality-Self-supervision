In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. No change in the appearance of the left perihilar opacification associated with volume loss in the left upper lobe in a patient with known late stage lung malignancy. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with increased prominence of interstitial markings on the left. This could represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, though in view of the extensive changes in the left hemithorax, the possibility of lymph NJ and metastases would have to be considered. The right lung is essentially clear.
