Low lung volumes are present. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Minimal patchy bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormalities present.
