Comparison is made with prior study ___. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. Pacemaker leads are in standard position. Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC. There are low lung volumes. There has been interval worsening of moderate pulmonary edema and bibasilar opacities. Bibasilar opacities could be due to a combination of atelectasis and small pleural effusions, larger on the left side, though superimposed pneumonia cannot be totally excluded. Asymmetric opacity at the periphery of the right upper lobe, is also worrisome for pneumonia.
