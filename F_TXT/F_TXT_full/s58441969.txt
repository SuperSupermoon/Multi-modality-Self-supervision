An endotracheal tube tip is seen 4 cm above the carina. A left-sided subclavian catheter tip terminates in the right atrium. A nasoenteric tube terminates in the stomach. Lung volumes are low, accentuating the pulmonary vasculature. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted. A small left effusion is likely present. There is no discrete consolidation, or pneumothorax.
