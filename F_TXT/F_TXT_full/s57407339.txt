Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates the very low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding. There is increased density at the right lung base, which is consistent with lobar collapse and probable small pleural effusion. Assessment of the cardiac silhouette is difficult given the low lung volumes. No pneumothorax. A right-sided Port-A-Cath ends in the upper right atrium.
