The patient is intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.6 cm above the carina. The known left chest wall mass with massive rib destructions has obviously slightly increased in extent and is causing relatively large left pleural effusion with both basal, lateral and apical component. These changes lead to substantial volume loss in the left hemithorax and subsequent shift of the mediastinal structures to the left. Mild hyperexpansion of the right lung. Several of the larger nodules in the right lung, documented on a CT examination from ___, are seen on the chest x-ray.
