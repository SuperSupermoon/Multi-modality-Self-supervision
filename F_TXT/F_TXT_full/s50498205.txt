AP chest compared to ___: Volume of the postoperative right lung has improved considerably, and the volume of the persistent right apical pleural space has decreased, though now it contains more fluid than air. Subcutaneous emphysema has increased. Two right pleural drains remain. Left lung is clear. Heart size is normal. Greater fullness in the right lower tracheobronchial angle could be due to paramediastinal pleural fluid, but should be carefully followed to exclude a developing hematoma.
