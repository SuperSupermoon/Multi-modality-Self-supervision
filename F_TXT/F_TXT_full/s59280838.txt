Wires of a left chest wall pacer terminate over the right atrium and right ventricle, similar to prior. The heart is normal size with stable cardiomediastinal contours. The aortic knob calcification is similar to prior. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle and elevation of the apparent right hemidiaphragm is compatible with a moderate-sized pleural effusion, not appreciably changed since the prior exam, allowing for difference in patient position. Adjacent opacity is compatible with atelectasis, but underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Pulmonary vascular markings are unremarkable.
