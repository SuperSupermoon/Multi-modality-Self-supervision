Interval improvement in heterogeneous bilateral lung opacities, with residual coarse reticular opacities suggesting a chronic interstitial fibrotic lung disease. No definite superimposed pneumonia, but a subtle area of infection involving the left lower lobe or lingula would be difficult to exclude given the extensive fibrotic changes. Therefore, if there is strong clinical suspicion for acute infection, CT may be considered if warranted clinically.
