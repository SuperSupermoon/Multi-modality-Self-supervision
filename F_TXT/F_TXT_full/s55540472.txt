AP chest compared to ___: Compared to ___, both lower lobes, particularly the left are better aerated. Heterogeneous consolidation in the right lung is more pronounced than the left, but neither is changed appreciably over the past five days. Findings are more readily explained by multifocal infection, but could be due to ARDS. Borderline cardiomegaly is unchanged. Right internal jugular sheath, ET tube, and nasogastric drainage tube are in standard placements respectively. Recent chest CT scan shows the right pleural thickening may be due to asbestos-related pleural reaction.
