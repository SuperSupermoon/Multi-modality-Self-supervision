Diffuse airspace opacities in the right lower lobe are apparently new compared to the prior CT, and likely obscure underlying known ground-glass nodules in this region. If the bronchoscopic procedure was performed in the right lung, this could be due to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Alternatively, pulmonary hemorrhage, massive aspiration and infectious pneumonia are additional considerations for this appearance. Lungs are otherwise remarkable for subtle multifocal poorly defined opacities which probably correspond to the known ground-glass nodules on CT. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
