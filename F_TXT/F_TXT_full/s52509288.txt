Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.6 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen, side port at the level of the expected position in the gastric fundus with distal tip also in the expected location of the stomach. There is mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Right lung base atelectasis is seen. There is thickening in the right minor fissure versus possible small amount of pleural fluid. There are relatively low lung volumes. There is mild central vascular pulmonary engorgement. Left base retrocardiac opacity Could be due to atelectasis, although underlying aspiration or infection is not excluded.
