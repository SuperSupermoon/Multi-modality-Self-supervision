Compared to the prior film, there is a new or significantly increased small to moderate left effusion, with underlying left base collapse and/or consolidation. Small right effusion and patchy right base opacity is similar to the prior film. Overall CHF findings appear slightly worse, with increased vascular plethora and slight vascular blurring. Vague opacity in the right mid zone is similar to the prior film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears somewhat larger. While this may in part be accentuated by a TECHNIQUE, I suspect that there has been some interval cardiac enlargement. No obvious pneumothorax, but the possibility of a tiny right apical pneumothorax cannot be entirely excluded.
