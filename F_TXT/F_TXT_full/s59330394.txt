COMPARED TO CHEST RADIOGRAPHS ___. Some of the increase in caliber of the upper mediastinum, primarily in the right paratracheal location is due to venous engorgement just from semi-erect positioning, but there has probably been an increase in central venous pressure or volume or both. Possibility of new pericardial effusion should be evaluated clinically. If this were due to mediastinal hemorrhage, I would expect contralateral displacement of the trachea which has not recurred. Allowing for differences in radiographic technique cardiac size has not increased. Lungs are clear. No pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
