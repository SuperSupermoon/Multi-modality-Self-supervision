Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Allowing the difference in position of the patient, there has been no interval change in moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Tracheostomy is in standard position. Left IJ catheter tip is in the upper-to-mid SVC. Two enteric tubes are present, the tips are out of view below the diaphragm. Cardiac size is partially obscured by the pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.
