No relevant change as compared to the previous radiograph, on the right, the lung volumes might have minimally increased, reflecting minimally improved ventilation. Nonetheless, atelectatic changes are seen at the right lung bases. The large masslike left upper lobe opacity and the subsequent left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity, combined with atelectasis and some loculated pleural effusion are constant. Constant appearance of the cardiac silhouette. Constant position of the right PICC line.
