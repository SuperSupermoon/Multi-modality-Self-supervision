The lungs are poorly expanded accounting for some vascular crowding. Bilateral hilar prominence is related to supine positioning rather than vascular engorgement. Cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube ends approximately 1.5 cm above the carina but the patient's neck is seen to be in flexion. A nasogastric tube has the side port in the stomach and the tip out of view.
