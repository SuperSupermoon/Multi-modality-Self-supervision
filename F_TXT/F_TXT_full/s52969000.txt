Right pleural effusion is substantially drained following insertion of the right basal PleurX catheter. Large persistent opacity projecting over the right mid lung could be fissural fluid, but pneumonia should be excluded. Moderate left basal atelectasis unchanged. Small left pleural effusion is presumed. Heart is mildly to moderately enlarged, may have decreased since prior studies in ___ and earlier today.
