The patient is status post sternotomy, with mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The left ventricular silhouette itself appears smaller. Again seen is left-sided chest tube, similar in configuration. New compared with the prior study, there is much more extensive subcutaneous emphysema, now outlining the pectoralis muscle fibers and with prominent new subcutaneous emphysema in the left supraclavicular fossa. The left chest tube side port remains in a similar position, without obvious interval retraction. Lucency at the base of the left heart and along the left chest wall inferiorly is compatible with the known pneumothorax. The left apical component of the pneumothorax appears less pronounced, with only a small residual pneumothorax seen at the left lung apex. On the right, there is an equivocal small residual apical pneumothorax, decreased compare with the prior study. Upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. Atelectasis at the right base, which is more pronounced. No gross effusion on either side. Previously seen right IJ sheath is been removed. Small amounts of calcification are seen in both carotid arteries.
