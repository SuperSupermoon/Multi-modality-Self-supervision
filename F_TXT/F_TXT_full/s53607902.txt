A single portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. The patient is rotated to the left. An endotracheal tube ends 2.7 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm, ending within the stomach. Lung volumes are slightly low. Heterogeneous left mid lung opacities could be due to atelectasis, aspiration pneumonitis, or infection. The lungs are otherwise clear. Note is made of cardiac dextroposition. The heart is normal in size. There is no pneumothorax. No pleural effusions are seen.
