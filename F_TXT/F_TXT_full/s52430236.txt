Comparison is made with the prior study, ___. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal and midline. Right PICC tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Right pleural effusion is less conspicuous than before; this could be due to a difference in positioning of the patient. Right lower lobe opacities are likely due to atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. The left lung is clear. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
