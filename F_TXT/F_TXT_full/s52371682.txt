Interval extubation. Left PICC is unchanged in position, and nasogastric tube continues to terminate within the stomach with side port in close proximity to the GE junction. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Diffuse opacification of the right upper lobe persists, with associated mild volume loss. Internal lucencies within this lobe likely represent necrotizing pneumonia. Within the left lung, improving interstitial edema is present, as well as decreasing atelectasis at the left base. Persistent small left pleural effusion.
