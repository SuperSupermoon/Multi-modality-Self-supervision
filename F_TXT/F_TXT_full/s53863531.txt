Single portable chest radiograph was provided. Right PICC terminates in the mid SVC. The left pleural effusion has significantly decreased in size. There is no pneumothorax. Small nodular opacities, best seen in the left upper lobe are better visualized on the recent CT. Again seen are extensive aortic calcifications with a tortuous aorta.
