Slightly oblique positioning. Lines and tubes overlie the chest. In this setting, the extreme tip of the ET tube is not well delineated. It appears to lie approximately 4.3 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. An additional ___/oral gastric tube also courses beneath the diaphragm, off the film. A right IJ line tip overlies the distal SVC. A right subclavian PICC type line tip lies at the level of the SVC/RA junction. There is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring. There is patchy retrocardiac opacity and a small pleural effusion or pleural thickening at the left base, unchanged. The nodular density seen at the left base on the film from ___ at 11:29 a.m. is less apparent on today's exam, probably obscured. The right lung is without focal consolidation or effusion. The tracheal air column and the presence or absence of some mediastinal air cannot be assessed on this exam due to oblique positioning.
