The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heterogeneous right lower lobe opacity is most consistent with atelectasis. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable. An enteric feeding tube is seen coursing midline with tip in stomach and side ports above the level of the diaphragm. An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position.
