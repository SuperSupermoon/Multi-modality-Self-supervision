Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Cardiac silhouette demonstrates left ventricular configuration and is at least upper limits of normal in size. Aorta is tortuous. Questionable pulmonary vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema, although the effects of crowding of bronchovascular structures could potentially account for this appearance. Patchy and linear left basilar opacities likely represent atelectasis. Possible small left effusion. Recommend standard PA and lateral chest radiograph with improved inspiratory level for more complete evaluation when the patient's condition allows.
