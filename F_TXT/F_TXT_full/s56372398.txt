Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 5.5 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not seen, but coursing into the expected location of the stomach. There are likely bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. The right hemidiaphragm appears elevated. There are chronic right chest wall deformities. Slight prominence of the hila may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are otherwise stable.
