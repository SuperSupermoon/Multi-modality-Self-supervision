In comparison with study of ___, the diffuse pulmonary opacifications, especially in the upper zones, have decreased, suggestive of some clearing of pulmonary edema. However, the prominence in the upper zones raises the possibility that some of this opacification reflects aspiration or pneumonia, unless the patient had been in a Trendelenburg position during the surgery. Opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. Atelectatic changes and possible small effusion are also seen on the right. The central catheter tip again extends to the mid SVC. Of incidental note are rounded opacifications about the right shoulder, which could reflect joint bodies.
