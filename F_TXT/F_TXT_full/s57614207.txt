AP chest compared to ___: The shift in greatest pulmonary opacification from the left upper to the right mid lung since ___ suggests that most of the changes are due to positional redistribution of edema, but it should be noted that combination of variable atelectasis and persistent pneumonia could give the same features. There is still a moderate-to-large volume of right pleural fluid and the heart is substantially dilated. No pneumothorax.
