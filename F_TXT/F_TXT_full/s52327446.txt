An ET tube is present. The carina is not well visualized, but the tip lies at the level of the mid clavicular heads probably approximately 5.0 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath the diaphragm, overlying the stomach. Right and? left chest tubes and mediastinal drains are present. Right IJ sheath present, tip over proximal SVC. The right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is been removed. No pneumothorax detected. Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged the probably unchanged allowing for differences in technique. There is mild vascular blurring, but no definite CHF. Again seen is dense opacity abutting the left upper chest wall and effacing much of the upper zone. There is probably also a left perihilar opacity which in retrospect is unchanged. Increased retrocardiac density again noted. The left costophrenic sulcus is obscured, but this may be due to overlying materials rather than the significant left effusion. At the right base, there is new hazy opacity, possibly reflecting a small pleural effusion together with some atelectasis.
