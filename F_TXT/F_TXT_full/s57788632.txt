The lungs are clear of focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size, and there is no pulmonary edema. There is an enteric tube which terminates in the stomach. Gaseous distention of bowel loops in the upper abdomen is compatible with known small bowel obstruction seen on the same day CT. Right upper quadrant abdominal surgical clips are noted.
