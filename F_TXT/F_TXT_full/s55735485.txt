Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates improvement in loculated right pleural effusion, with slightly better aeration of the right lung. Hazy right lung opacity likely represents a component of edema, possibly from recent procedure. There is persistent right-sided atelectasis. Extensive pleural involvement of the right lung is redemonstrated. No definite pneumothorax is identified.
