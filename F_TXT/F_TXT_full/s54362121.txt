The aortic arch is densely calcified. Otherwise, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is moderate relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to the right with patchy opacities in the left lower lung most suggestive of atelectasis. Chronicity of diaphragmatic elevation cannot be assessed.
