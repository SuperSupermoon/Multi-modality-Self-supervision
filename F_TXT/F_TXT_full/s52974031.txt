Single AP portable frontal view of the chest was obtained. Again seen is asymmetry and volume loss and opacification of the right hemithorax. Postoperative changes of the right hemithorax are noted. Right hemithorax opacification again likely represents combination of radiation changes and volume loss. Given differences in patient position, there appears to be slight decrease in the opacification of the right lung. The left lung is clear aside from mild left base atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Mediastinal contours are similar to slightly less prominent as compared to the prior study. Hilar contours are similar in appearance.
