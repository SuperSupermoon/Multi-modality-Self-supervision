In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the appearance of the left hemithorax following lower lobectomy. There is persistent essentially complete collapse of the left upper lobe with associated volume loss with displacement of mediastinal structures to that side. The right lung shows only mild atelectatic or fibrotic changes.
