There has been interval placement of a left chest tube with of the tip of the pigtail catheter overlying the left mid lung peripherally. Lucency within the left lung base likely reflects residual pneumothorax, though there has been interval re-expansion of the left lung. Ill-defined opacities are noted within the left lung base as well as within the right perihilar region. No large pleural effusion is demonstrated. Endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating at the level of carina. Enteric tube tip is within stomach, aklthough the side port is likely within the distal esophagus, and can be advanced. Left subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Subcutaneous emphysema is noted in the left lateral chest wall.
