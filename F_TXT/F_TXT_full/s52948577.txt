AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained two hours earlier during the same day. Patient is status post recent left-sided thoracocentesis and the previously identifiable left-sided pleural effusion has diminished mildly. Still the left-sided diaphragm which is somewhat elevated, remains obscured. No new parenchymal infiltrates are seen and no pneumothorax exists in the apical area. Right-sided Port-A-Cath system and PICC line in unchanged position.
