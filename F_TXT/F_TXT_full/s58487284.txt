A nasogastric tube with radio-opaque tip projects over the left upper quadrant as before. Lung volumes are slightly lower than on the prior comparison examination. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are probably similar given differences in technique. The heart is normal in size. Bibasilar opacities and opacity in the right upper lobe are demonstrated. This could represent early asymmetric CHF. An early pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded. No frank consolidation is seen. There is no pneumothorax or gross pleural effusion.
