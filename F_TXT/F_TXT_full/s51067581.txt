Since the prior study the pseudotumor (fluid in the major fissure) on the right has resolved. Post treatment changes including elevation of the right hilus and coarse interstitial changes indicative of radiation fibrosis are again noted, a chronic finding. Obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm is likely a function of atelectasis and a small pleural effusion. The left lung is largely clear. Heart size and mediastinal contours are stable. Heavily calcified aortic arch is again noted.
