Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained 06:39 a.m. The extent of severe subcutaneous air collection is unchanged. Left chest tube, Dobbhoff tube, tracheostomy are in unchanged position. Central venous line most likely present on the right, cannot be due to substantial air within the pectoralis muscles. Overall, no substantial change since the prior study demonstrated. In left upper lung, there is lucency which might potentially reflect consolidating infectious process/fluid collection, again difficult to assess when superimposed by substantial amount of subcutaneous air.
