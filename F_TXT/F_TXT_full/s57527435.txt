AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: With the chin slightly flexed, ET tube position 23 mm from the carina is acceptable. Lung volumes are low and combined with supine positioning to exaggerate mild mediastinal pulmonary vascular engorgement though there may be mild volume overload. Heart size is top normal. The stomach is appreciably distended with air and fluid, but there is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
