Comparison is made to prior study performed the day before. ET tube tip is 6.6 cm above the carina. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the mid to lower SVC. NG tube tip is in the stomach. There are persistent low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Bibasilar opacities have increased due to worsening atelectasis, left greater than right. Small left pleural effusion has increased. Previously seen right pneumothorax is no longer visualized. Right basal chest tube is in place. Widespread lung opacities otherwise have improved. Extensive subcutaneous gas in the chest wall bilaterally is unchanged.
