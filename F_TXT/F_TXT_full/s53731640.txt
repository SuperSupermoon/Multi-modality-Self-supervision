NG tube tip is in the stomach. The side hole is just distal to the EG junction. Of note, the NG has been pulled back few centimeters from prior study performed eleven hours earlier. There are low lung volumes. Cardiac size is top normal. There is crowding of the bronchovasculature, I doubt the presence of vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacities larger on the left side, are likely atelectasis, unchanged.
