As compared to the previous radiograph, the left chest drain has been removed. There is no evidence of left pneumothorax. No relevant left pleural effusions. On the right, the chest tube is in unchanged position. The extent of the left effusion has minimally decreased, but the effusion is still moderate in extent, causing opacification of a substantial part of the right hemithorax. Unchanged appearance of the heart and the mediastinum.
