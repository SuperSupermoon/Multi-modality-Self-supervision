A frontal semi upright chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, intact sternal wires, a nasogastric tube terminating in the stomach, a right chest wall cardiac pacing device with the lead overlying the right ventricle, as well as a left approach cardiac L which also overlies the right ventricle. There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly, exaggerated by low lung volumes. Patchy airspace opacities bilaterally, particularly in the left base, may represent mild pulmonary edema. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
