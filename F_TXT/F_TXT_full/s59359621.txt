Single frontal view of the chest shows minimal changes since prior chest radiograph. Spinal hardware and right jugular Port-A-Cath are unchanged. Lung volume still low, but without consolidation suspicious for pneumonia. Prominence of the lung vasculature is likely related to low lung volume. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
