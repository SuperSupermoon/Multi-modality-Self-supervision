Radiographs centered near the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessment of a feeding tube, which coils within the stomach. Interval extubation and removal of a right internal jugular vascular central venous catheter, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size, and the aorta is tortuous and calcified. Interval resolution of pulmonary edema and improved aeration at both lung bases. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions also appear slightly smaller.
