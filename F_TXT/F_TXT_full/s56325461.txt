Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution without overt pulmonary edema, a finding which appears chronic. Patchy opacities in the lung bases also persist, and likely reflect chronic bronchiectasis with atelectasis although aspiration is not excluded. No pneumothorax is identified though assessment is slightly limited due to the patient's neck and soft tissues of the chin projecting over these regions. No pleural effusion is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
