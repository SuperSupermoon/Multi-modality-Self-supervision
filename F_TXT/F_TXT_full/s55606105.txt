Since the prior outside study, there has been interval collapse of the right upper lobe, with elevation of the horizontal fissure. The aerated portions of the lungs are grossly clear. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.8 cm above the level of the carina, and could be advanced slightly. A nasogastric tube courses through the esophagus, with distal tip in the stomach, but side hole port at the level of the distal esophagus, an can be advanced approximately 6.5 cm to ensure placement into the stomach.
