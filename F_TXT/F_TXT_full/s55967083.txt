Since the prior chest radiograph, there has been interval repositioning of the right PICC, and the loop has since resolved. However, the tip remains at the distal right subclavian and appears to be heading superiorly towards the right internal jugular vein. Repositioning is advised. There has otherwise been no relevant change. Stable mild pulmonary edema, bibasilar atelectasis and pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
