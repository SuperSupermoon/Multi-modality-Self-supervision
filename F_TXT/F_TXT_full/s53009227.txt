AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are very low. Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung has worsened, probably atelectasis and concurrent mild but worsening pulmonary edema. Small pleural effusions are presumed. No pneumothorax. Mediastinal widening is due to severe mediastinal vascular engorgement. The heart is not particularly enlarged. ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements respectively, and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. No pneumothorax.
