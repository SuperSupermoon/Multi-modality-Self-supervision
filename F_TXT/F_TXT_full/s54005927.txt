There is now near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax, likely due to a combination of worsening right upper lobe pneumonia, right middle and right lower lobe collapse, and a pleural effusion. Known juxtahilar mass is obscured by these findings. Within the left lung, there is worsening diffuse heterogeneous opacification superimposed upon emphysema. It is uncertain whether this represents pulmonary edema or more widespread infection. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has slightly increased in size, but there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Focal area of radiodensity in the lower mediastinum is likely located within the esophagus given history of recent esophagram showing retained barium within the esophagus, proximal to the site of compression.
