There is an orogastric tube whose distal tip is not included on the image. However it is below the GE junction and appears unchanged from the prior study. There is a right IJ central line with the distal lead tip in the distal SVC. Stent device projects over the heart. There are coarse bronchovascular markings at the lung bases consistent with the known interstitial lung disease. There is again seen a small lateral right hydropneumothorax, stable.
