As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimally improved transparency of the lung bases bilaterally, suggesting a minimal decrease in extent of the pre-existing pleural effusions. The bilateral chest tubes are in unchanged position. The rounded structure at the left lung bases, presumably a rounded atelectasis, is still visible. No distinct pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly.
