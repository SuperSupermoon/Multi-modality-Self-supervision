The endotracheal tube ends 4.7 cm above the level of the carina. A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the low SVC. A large-bore tunneled right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the high right atrium, unchanged. A Dobbhoff tube ends within the stomach. Lung volumes are low, decreased compared to the prior study. Heterogeneous opacities at the left lung base are increased, likely secondary to pneumonia, although atelectasis could have a similar appearance. The right lung is clear, allowing for bronchovascular crowding. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal. There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.
