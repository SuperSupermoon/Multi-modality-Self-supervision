AP chest reviewed in the absence of a conventional chest radiograph more recent than ___: Lung volumes are very low and in addition to the unmistakable atelectasis at the right lung base, consolidation at the left is probably atelectasis as well if the patient has had recent surgery. Low lung volumes exaggerate a mildly enlarged heart. There is probably a small left pleural effusion, but no pneumothorax. Upper lungs do not show edema, although there is mild vascular congestion. No pneumothorax is present.
