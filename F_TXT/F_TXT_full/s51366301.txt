The cardiac silhouette size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vascularity is normal. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Relative lucency within the lung apices is reflective of paraseptal emphysema, better delineated on the prior CT. Minimal streaky opacities are noted in the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
