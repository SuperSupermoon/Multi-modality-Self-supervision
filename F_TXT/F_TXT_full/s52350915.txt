Comparison is made with prior study performed eight hours earlier. There has been interval decrease in size of now small right pleural effusion. There is no evident pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly, widened mediastinum, multiple lung nodules and a large mass in the right upper lobe are unchanged. Left lower lobe opacity is stable, a combination of pleural effusion, atelectasis and lung nodules.
