Single portable view of the chest. Endotracheal tube is seen with tip approximately 6 cm from the carina and can be advanced several cm for optimal positioning. Left-sided PICC is seen with its tip in the upper SVC. There is complete whiteout of the left hemithorax. There is no definite mediastinal shift. This may be due to combination of underlying effusion and atelectasis/consolidation. The right lung is grossly clear. No acute osseous abnormality is detected. Stent is partially visualized in the right upper quadrant.
