A radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained to assess for placement of an orogastric tube, which terminates within the stomach. Within the chest, endotracheal tube and central venous catheter are unchanged in position, and there remains marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, now accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Worsening homogeneous opacity in the right mid and lower lung region likely represents a combination of a large right pleural effusion and atelectasis involving the right middle and right lower lobes.
