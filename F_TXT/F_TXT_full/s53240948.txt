AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are grossly stable. There is substantial interval decrease in right pleural effusion after placement of the right chest tube that has replaced the pigtail catheter previously demonstrated. The current examination reveals no substantial pneumothorax with only minimal amount of air potentially present at the apex, unclear. Right basal opacity most likely reflects residual atelectasis after draining of pleural effusion.
