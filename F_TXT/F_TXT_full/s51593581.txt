Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from earlier the same day at 4:23 p.m. There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube which is approximately 6 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen to terminate at the GE junction and should be advanced. The lungs are notable for an azygos lobe and fissure. Right mid lung opacity may be due to atelectasis given rapid interval development since prior exam two hours prior.
