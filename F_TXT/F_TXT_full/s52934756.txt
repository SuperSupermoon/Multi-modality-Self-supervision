As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen as related to the right upper lobe opacity. The presence of a calcified granuloma in this region makes chronicity of these changes likely. Minimal blunting of the left and right costophrenic sinus have newly appeared, likely reflecting minimal pleural effusions. Mild fluid overload is present. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Slightly increasing extent of a retrocardiac atelectasis. The Dobbhoff catheter and the endotracheal tube are in unchanged position.
