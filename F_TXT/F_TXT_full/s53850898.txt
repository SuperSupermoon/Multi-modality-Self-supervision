AP chest compared to ___: Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema has worsened since ___. The heart is only mildly enlarged, so noncardiac causes should be entertained as well as cardiac. Pleural effusions are small, unchanged. I understand the patient is recently postpartum, which raises the possibility of amniotic fluid embolus or perinatal cardiomyopathy, or the effects of toxemia, all depending upon appropriate clinical circumstances of course.
