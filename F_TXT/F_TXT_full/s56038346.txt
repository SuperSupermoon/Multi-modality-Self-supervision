Radiograph centered in the lower thorax was obtained for assessment of a nasogastric tube, which terminates within the distal stomach. Endotracheal tube and central venous catheters are unchanged in position. As compared to the prior study, there has been improved aeration in the left lung, with better visualization of a large rounded mass measuring about 9 cm in diameter extending from the left juxtahilar region to the lung periphery. Surrounding airspace opacity is present in the left upper lobe and lingula, and persistent left retrocardiac opacity is present, likely reflecting a combination of lower lobe atelectasis and adjacent moderate left pleural effusion. Within the right lung, previously present interstitial edema has nearly resolved.
