Right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. Lung volumes remain somewhat diminished, and there is some crowding of the perihilar vasculature. There are patchy bibasilar opacities which could represent atelectasis in the setting of diminished lung volumes, although pneumonia should also be considered. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
