The patient is status post median sternotomy with intact wires. Multiple mediastinal clips are compatible with prior CABG. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The descending thoracic aorta is moderately tortuous in its course. Eventration of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged. The lungs are symmetrically well aerated. Mild atelectasis is noted in the left lung base. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle appears chronic, likely related to pleural thickening. No significant pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal consolidation is seen. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Mild increased interstitial opacities at the lung bases appear to be chronic. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
