Compared with ___ at 17:24 p.m., a new catheter overliesthe right chest could overlie the costophrenic angle. The right-sided sided pleural effusions/hemothorax is improved. A small right-sided pleural fluid/hemothorax remains present. There is lucency at the right lung apex -- ? tiny pneumothorax. Attention to this area on followup films is recommended. Again seen is patchy opacity at the left base, now with air bronchograms, consistent with left lower lobe consolidation. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, without gross effusion. No CHF.
