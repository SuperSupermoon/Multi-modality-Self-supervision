Right-sided pacer wire is again seen from a right internal jugular approach, terminating by coiling in the region of the right ventricle. The appearance is similar to the prior study. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. Again, prominence of the hila may suggest pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
