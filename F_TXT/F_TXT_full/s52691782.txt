In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued hyperexpansion of the lungs with coarse interstitial markings consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. In view of the top normal-sized heart, some of the interstitial changes could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure. There is now some asymmetry in opacification at the bases, somewhat more prominent on the right. This raises the possibility of a developing area of pneumonia or a reflection of pulmonary contusion following trauma. However, no evidence of pneumothorax.
