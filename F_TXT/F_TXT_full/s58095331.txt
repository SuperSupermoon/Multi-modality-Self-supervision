The patient is intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.6 cm above the carina. The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable. The patient shows extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities with primarily alveolar component, accompanied by a minimal interstitial component. The findings would be consistent with very extensive permeability edema. The lung volumes are low. Moderate cardiomegaly. No larger pleural effusions can be detected. No evidence of pneumothorax. At the upper level of the right hilus, a circular structure of 3 cm in diameter is seen that could represent an object outside the patient.
