The tip of the feeding tube is not visualized. The remaining support apparatus are in good position. The cardiac silhouette remains prominent and there again is evidence of bilateral layering moderate pleural effusions, left greater than right. Retrocardiac opacity, consistent with continued volume loss in the left lower lobe, has slightly worsened. There also ill-defined opacity along the right minor fissure and right lower lobe could represent atelectasis or new consolidation. No evidence of acute pneumothorax.
