There are relatively low lung volumes and the patient is rotated slightly to the left. Given this, no definite focal consolidation is seen. Mild left base atelectasis is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in technique and patient position. An ovoid 1.3 cm calcified left paratracheal structure may represent a calcified mediastinal lymph node.
