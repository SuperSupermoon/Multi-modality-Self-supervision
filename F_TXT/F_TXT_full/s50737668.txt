Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. There is a large right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis as well. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. A left-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the origin of the SVC. Known calcified hepatic cyst projects over the right upper quadrant.
