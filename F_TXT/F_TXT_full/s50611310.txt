A single portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained. An endotracheal tube terminates appropriately above the carina. The side hole and tip of the enteric catheter are below the diaphragm. The lungs are well expanded. A triangular opacity at the right hilus/perihilar region does not obscure the right heart border. There is left base atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
