Comparison is made with prior study performed 11 hours earlier. Peristent collapse of the left lower lobe. Left effusion has slightly increased; it is moderate in amount. Left perihilar opacities have increased. This could be due to re-expansion edema, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There is mild interstitial edema. Small right effusion has increased. Cardiomegaly has minimally increased. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Right IJ catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax.
