Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Right perihilar consolidation is again noted, consistent with infection. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has worsened. Opacities in the left lower lobe have worsened; a combination of atelectasis, effusion and edema. Cardiomegaly is stable. The aorta is tortuous. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. There is no pneumothorax. Small right effusion is more conspicuous than before.
