Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and apparent asymmetrical pulmonary edema involving the right lung to a substantially greater degree than the left. An infectious pneumonia in the right lung could produce a similar appearance. Overall, these findings are similar to the recent study with no new areas of consolidation elsewhere in the lungs. Bilateral pleural effusions are also unchanged. Stable cardiomediastinal contours calcified left ventricular apical aneurysm.
