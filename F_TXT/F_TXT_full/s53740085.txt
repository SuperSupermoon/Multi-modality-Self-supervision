There has been no significant interval change to the appearance of the chest with very low lung volumes and bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. There is bibasilar atelectasis and central pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac silhouette is unchanged. A right chest Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax is present. Extensive sclerotic foci seen throughout the skeleton is consistent with known metastatic breast cancer and better assessed on the prior CT scan
