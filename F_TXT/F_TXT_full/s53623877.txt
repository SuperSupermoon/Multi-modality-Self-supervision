In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Continued relatively low lung volumes accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with layering pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Minimal atelectatic changes are seen at the right base.
