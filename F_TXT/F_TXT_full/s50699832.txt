An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A left IJ central line is present, tip overlying proximal SVC. Lordotic positioning. Allowing for this, no pneumothorax detected. Multiple additional wires and leads overlie the chest and require clinical correlation. There are low inspiratory volumes. There is probable cardiomegaly, with cardiomediastinal silhouette grossly unchanged. There are diffuse relatively granular opacities throughout both lungs. The area of air bronchograms in the left upper zone on the prior film appears to demonstrate some partial interval clearing, though remains at markedly abnormal. There may have been very slight interval clearing of the dense retrocardiac opacity. Possibility of small effusions cannot be excluded.
