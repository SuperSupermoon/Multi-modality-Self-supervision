Frontal radiograph demonstrates interval worsening of bilateral hazy opacifications in the lung bases which is likely due to worsening pulmonary edema. There is also an increase in right pleural effusion with fluid seen tracking along the oblique fissure. There is no pneumothorax. There is an ill-defined hazy opacity in the right upper lung which is seen on previous radiographs and may represent an area of scarring, however this should be correlated clinically. The heart size is not significantly changed since the prior study.
