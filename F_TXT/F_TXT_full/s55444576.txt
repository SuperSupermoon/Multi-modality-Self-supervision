Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Persistent dense left retrocardiac opacity is present, and may reflect either atelectasis or pneumonia, accompanied by an adjacent small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. Improving aeration at right lung base is likely due to improving small effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
