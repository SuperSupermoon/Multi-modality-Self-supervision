This study includes a PA view only. The heart is at the upper limits of normal size. Ascending aortic contour is prominent and perhaps somewhat greater than on the prior examination, although comparison is somewhat limited due to slight differences in orientation. There is a patchy new opacity in the right lower lung, worrisome for pneumonia. In the left mid upper lung, several calcifications suggesting granulomas are present. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
