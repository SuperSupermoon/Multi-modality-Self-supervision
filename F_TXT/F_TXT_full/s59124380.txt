The small right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis is unchanged. There is suggestion of a new small left pleural effusion with persistent atelectasis obscuring the hemidiaphragm. Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are unchanged. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax. A right IJ central venous line terminates in the SVC. There are subtle linear irregularities of several left ribs and at least one right rib which may indicate the presence of nondisplaced fractures.
