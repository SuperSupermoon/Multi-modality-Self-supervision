There is no conventional radiographic evidence of pneumomediastinum, but note that CT is more sensitive than radiographs for detecting this process. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Lungs are clear except for a minimal patchy opacity in the left retrocardiac region. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
