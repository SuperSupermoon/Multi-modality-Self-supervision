There has been interval development of a right lower lung opacity, which is consistent with aspiration or pneumonia. The left lung remains clear. There may be a small right pleural effusion, but there is no left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There has been interval removal of an ET tube and an enteric tube. Right subclavian catheter is again present with tip terminating in the cavoatrial junction. Surgical clips are present in the right upper quadrant.
