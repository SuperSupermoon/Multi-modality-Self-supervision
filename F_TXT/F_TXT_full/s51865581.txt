In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the appearance of the right subclavian PICC line. Extends to the level of the cavoatrial junction and there is no evidence of kinking. The left subclavian catheter and endotracheal tube remain in good position. Again there is minimal enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The hemidiaphragms are more sharply seen, which could reflect improving pleural effusions or be a manifestation of a more upright position of the patient. Dense streak of atelectasis is seen in the left mid-zone.
