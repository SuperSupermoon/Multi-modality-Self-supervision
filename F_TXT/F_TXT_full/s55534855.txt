Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates clearing of pulmonary edema, most notable at the bilateral apices. Interval increase in consolidation in the right lower lobe. Stable bilateral pleural effusions. Interval widening of the superior mediastinum posterior to the trachea, suggesting recurrence of edema seen on admission. Heart is top normal in size. Endotracheal tube ends 2.5 cm from the carina. A large bore right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the mid SVC. Left-sided PICC line ends in the cavoatrial junction. Nasogastric tube is seen entering the stomach and out of the field of view. A right-sided mid-line ends in the axilla. No pneumothorax.
