In comparison with the study of ___, there again is extensive opacification bilaterally, consistent with large pleural effusions, more prominent on the left. Probably little change in the mediastinal contours. Hemodialysis catheter remains in place. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
