As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The patient shows bilateral relatively symmetrical predominantly basal opacities. The morphology of these opacities is rather suggestive of pulmonary edema than of pneumonia. Cardiomegaly persists. No larger pleural effusions. No new parenchymal opacities.
