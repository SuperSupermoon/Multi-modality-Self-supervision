Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of a right-sided chest tube without development of pneumothorax. Right-sided central venous catheter is stable with tip at the cavoatrial junction. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Interval resolution of previously noted mild vascular congestion as well as decreased bibasilar opacification likely reflecting atelectasis.
