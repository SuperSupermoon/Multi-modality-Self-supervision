Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. The patient is in vascular engorgement, but no overt pulmonary edema. There is potentially kink of the upper portion of the central venous line, although it might be external, please correlate clinically.
