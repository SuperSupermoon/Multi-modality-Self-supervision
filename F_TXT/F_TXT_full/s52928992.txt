The heart is mildly enlarged. The main pulmonary artery contour is again mildly prominent. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Streaky right infrahilar opacity is similar and appears most suggestive of atelectasis associated with large epicardial fat pad, seen on the prior CT. Smooth opacity also appears similar in the left costophrenic sulcus. There is no pneumothorax. An old right posterolateral sixth rib fracture appears unchanged.
