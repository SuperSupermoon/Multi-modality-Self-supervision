Rightward deviation of the trachea beginning above the thoracic inlet level suggestive of left lobe thyroid enlargement. Mediastinal contours are otherwise normal, and heart size is normal. Lungs are clear except for nonspecific patchy right infrahilar opacity, which could reflect patchy atelectasis, aspiration, or an early focus of pneumonia. PA and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful for more complete characterization of this region.
