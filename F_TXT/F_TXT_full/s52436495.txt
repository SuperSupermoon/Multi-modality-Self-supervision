The newly placed right internal jugular central venous line tip terminates in the lower SVC. The right pleural effusion is now layering and volume loss of the right lower lobe is unchanged. There is development of new atelectasis in the left lower lobe, which is otherwise clear. The newly placed endotracheal tube projects 3.5 cm from the carina, but due to the kyphotic angulation for this radiograph, this appears falsely low, and in fact is likely too high. No pneumothorax.
