A Dobhoff type tube is present, with radiopaque tip overlying the expected site of the gastric body. Note is made that there appears to be a central wire within a catheter, with a radiolucent segment between the central linear density and the radiopaque tip of the catheter. An additional vertically oriented catheter probably represents portion of the Dobhoff outside the patient. A right subclavian PICC line is present -- the tip is partially obscured by the other catheter, but likely lies at the SVC/RA junction similar to the prior study. No obvious pneumothorax is identified, though as noted, the extreme upper edge of the apices is excluded. The lungs are grossly clear, with minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. No free air seen beneath the diaphragm. A partially visualized bowel gas pattern is grossly unremarkable. Mild sigmoid scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine, with rotary component in the lumbar spine, is suggested.
