The lungs are well expanded. There is right apical scarring. Nodular abnormalities are seen in the left lung base, more dense today than on prior exam, possibly representing mucoid impaction. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Mid-thoracic and lumbar vertebroplasty changes are noted, similar to prior exam.
