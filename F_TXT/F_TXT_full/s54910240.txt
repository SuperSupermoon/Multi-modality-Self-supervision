Opacifications at the bilateral bases, right greater than the left, likely represent small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, now with worsening right middle lobe atelectasis compared to ___. The right upper lobe opacity seen on the preceding radiograph is no longer present which likely represents resolved right upper lobe atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. No pneumothorax is present. A right-sided PICC line is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the upper SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is moderately enlarged but unchanged.
