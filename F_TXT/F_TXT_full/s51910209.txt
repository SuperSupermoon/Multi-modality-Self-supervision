AP chest compared to ___: New pleural tube projects over the right upper chest. From single frontal view, I cannot tell how much of it is intrathoracic. It has three acute folds, which may be a function or visual foreshortening rathern than real, any one of which could be occlusive. The lower right chest has the appearance of an anterior pneumothorax, similarly difficult to assess without a lateral view. The indwelling right pleural drain in the lower chest is unchanged in position, with a suggestion that only a short segment of it is intrathoracic. The extent of right pleural thickening or loculated fluid has decreased in the upper chest a little since 7:42 a.m. following insertion of the second right pleural drain. Heart size is normal. Left lung is clear.
