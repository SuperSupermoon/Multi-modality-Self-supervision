A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends at the level of the inferior clavicular heads and is no less than 5.2cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube follows the expected course, although the tip is not visualized. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. New opacification of both lower lobes despite no change in lung volumes compared to the prior study is concerning for pneuomonia. The upper lung zones are clear. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax, although the left lung apex is obscured by the chin. The azygous vein is bigger than before with increased caliber of the left upper lobe vessels. The right hilus is chronically enlarged. Cardiac silhouette is stable. Flattening of the right humeral head may be due to avascular necrosis. Degenerative change is seen in the left shoulder girdle.
