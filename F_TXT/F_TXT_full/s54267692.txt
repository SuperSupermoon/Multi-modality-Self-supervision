Increasing extent. Of bilateral parenchymal opacities that pre existed. The symmetry of the changes would favor pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia. However, no other signs suggesting pulmonary edema are present so that bilateral pneumonia should be considered. Minimal increase in extent of bilateral pre-existing pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
