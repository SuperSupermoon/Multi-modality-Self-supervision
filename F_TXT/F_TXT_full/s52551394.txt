Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study. There has been an increase in the patchy airspace opacity seen throughout the left lung with a second more focal area in the right lower lung. Although the appearances may reflect pulmonary edema, particularly given the waxing waning appearance over the last several days, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Probable left pleural effusion. Support lines and tubes are unchanged in appearance when compared to the prior study. No pneumothorax seen.
