AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. ET tube tip is approximately 3 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Bilateral chest tubes are in place. No definitive pneumothorax is demonstrated. Bilateral pleural effusion is most likely present, small to moderate associated with bibasal areas of atelectasis with gradual overall improvement of basal lung aeration. Rib fractures on the right are better appreciated on the current radiograph than on the prior study but overall better seen on CT torso from ___. Gradual decrease in subcutaneous air is demonstrated, currently minimal.
