As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of prior relatively extensive bilateral pleural effusions as well as signs of moderate pulmonary edema. In addition to these changes, no new parenchymal opacities have occurred. It cannot be excluded, however, that in the large bilateral atelectatic lung regions, a developing pneumonia is present. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax.
