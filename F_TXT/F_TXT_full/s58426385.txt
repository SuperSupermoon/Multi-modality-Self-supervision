AP single view of the lower chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination obtained five hours earlier during the same day. Comparison with the previous study, the amount of pleural density has decreased and the left upper lung field shows improved aeration. As, however, this film concentrates on the lower esophagus, the upper chest and neck region is not included in the image. One can identify a new NG tube line in the upper esophagus seen to reach the lower thoracic area, but curling in a wide arch almost 360 degrees above the diaphragmatic level on the left side in retrocardiac position. Most likely is located in a large hiatal hernia. Referring physician, ___ was paged under #___ at 4:20 p.m.
