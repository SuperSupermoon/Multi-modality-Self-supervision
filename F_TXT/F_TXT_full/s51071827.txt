Portable supine radiograph shows interval placement of a left-sided subclavian line, the tip of which terminates in the upper to mid SVC. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina. A transesophageal tube is seen, the tip is not visualized. Supine technique exaggerates central pulmonary vasculature engorgement. Again seen is a right basilar opacity, not significantly changed since the prior examination, which may represent aspiration or edema in the appropriate clinical context. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified, though sensitivity is limited on supine film.
