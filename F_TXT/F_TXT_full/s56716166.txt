Portable supine AP view of the chest was provided. The right IJ central venous catheter has been removed and a right subclavian dialysis catheter is now in place with its tip residing within the right atrium. A right upper extremity PICC line is unchanged in position with its tip residing in the mid SVC region. A feeding tube courses into the left upper abdomen. Cardiomegaly is unchanged, with midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips again noted. There is left basilar opacity with effusion. Pulmonary edema persists. No pneumothorax is seen on the supine radiograph. Bony structures are intact. There is a subtle nodular peripheral opacity projecting over the right upper lung which appears stable from prior imaging studies and as per prior CT chest, likely represents loculated pleural fluid.
