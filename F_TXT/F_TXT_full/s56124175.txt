Upright AP chest radiograph. The tip of the left chest tube is slightly different in position, now lying along the inner surface of the left chest wall, near the site of chest rib fractures. The small focus of atelectasis in left mid lung persists, slightly more linear at this time. No definite pneumothorax is identified. Minimal atelectasis in the left costophrenic angle is new. There is probably also mild atelectasis at the right base accounting for a faint opacity there. No CHF or frank consolidation. No right effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, allowing for differences in positioning. Multiple rib fractures are again noted, best depicted on the ___ CT scan. Incidental note made of an old healed right proximal humeral fracture, with soft tissue fixation anchor over the right humeral head.
