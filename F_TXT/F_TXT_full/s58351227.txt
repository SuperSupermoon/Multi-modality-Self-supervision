The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs are well expanded. A double contour of the breast tissue bilaterally is consistent with bilateral breast implants. Hazy opacification of the lower lungs may be accounted for by breast implants. However, the suggestion of air bronchograms in the left retrocardiac space with slightly increased density in this area may be indicative of an acute process. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.
