As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change in extent of the known right pleural effusion. The pigtail catheter in the right pleural space is in unchanged position. A lucency paralleling the upper and lateral right chest wall is caused by a skinfold and should not be mistaken for a pneumothorax. Unchanged atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
