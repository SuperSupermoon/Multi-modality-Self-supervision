As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 5 cm above the carinal. The patient has also received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not visualized on the image. The lung volumes have overall increased, causing an apparent increase in radiodensity of the pre-existing predominantly right basal and left apical parenchymal opacities. However, the opacities might also have minimally increased in severity. No larger pleural effusions are present. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
