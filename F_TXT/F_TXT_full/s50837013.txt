Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Apparent enlargement of the left hilum is likely due to mild enlargement of the left lower lobe pulmonary artery due to pulmonary embolism as demonstrated on CT. Focal opacity within the left lower lobe is compatible with infarction. Streaky opacity in the right lower lobe may reflect an additional site of developing infarction or atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is noted. No pneumothorax is identified. Mild degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
