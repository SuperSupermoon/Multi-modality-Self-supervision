Moderate central pulmonary vascular congestion is associated with moderate to severe interstitial pulmonary edema, predominantly in the bilateral lung bases. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely. There is no pneumothorax or definite focal consolidation. The cardiomediastinal contour, including mild cardiomegaly, is unchanged. The osseous structures and upper abdomen are unremarkable.
