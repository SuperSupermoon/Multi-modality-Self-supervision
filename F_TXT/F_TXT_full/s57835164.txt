Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Lung volumes are slightly diminished with patchy opacities at the bases likely reflecting atelectasis, although aspiration should also be considered. Several small nodular opacities in the periphery of the right lung likely reflect prior granulomatous infection given their density. Clinical correlation would be recommended. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. No large effusions. If the patient's symptoms of hemoptysis persist, further imaging with dedicated chest CT may be indicated.
