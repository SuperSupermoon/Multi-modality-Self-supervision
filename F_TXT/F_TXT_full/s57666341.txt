AP chest compared to ___: Feeding tube ends in the upper portion of a mildly dilated stomach. A small right pleural effusion accompanied by new consolidation in the right lower lobe could be pneumonia or atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly is more pronounced, and pulmonary vasculature more profuse, suggesting early cardiac decompensation. No left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. No endotracheal tube visible below T1, the upper margin of this study.
