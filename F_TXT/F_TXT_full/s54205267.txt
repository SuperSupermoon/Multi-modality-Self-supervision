Severe chronic cardiomegaly has worsened and there is new pulmonary vascular congestion, but no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax, no pleural effusion, no mediastinal widening. As far as I can see on a single frontal portable chest radiograph, there has been no change in the position of left trans subclavian right atrial biventricular pacer defibrillator leads, continuous from the left pectoral generator.
