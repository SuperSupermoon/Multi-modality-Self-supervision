Compared with ___ at 13;___, I doubt significant interval change. Vascular plethora is similar to the prior film. Cardiomegaly, right base opacity opacity, and some patchy opacity at the left base are also similar to the prior film. COPD, with deformity of the left upper chest consistent with old healed rib fractures, is again noted. Left subclavian PICC line tip overlies the SVC/RA junction, similar to the prior film.
