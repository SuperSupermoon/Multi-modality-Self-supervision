As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube and the right internal jugular vein catheter are in unchanged position. The lung volumes have decreased, causing an apparent increase in extent and severity of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities at the lung bases on both the left and the right site. Only the very lung apices are cardiac widely ventilated. The size of the cardiac silhouette can no longer be delineated. No pneumothorax.
