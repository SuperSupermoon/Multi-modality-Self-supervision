The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Known left upper lobe mass is grossly stable. Left basilar opacity is seen with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm which may be due to atelectasis; however, underlying consolidation or disease spread is not excluded. The previously more focal right basilar opacity is less dense; however, there continues to be patchy opacities in the right mid-to-lower lung which may be due to multifocal infection and/or mass suprahilar. Left costophrenic angle is blunted and a small left pleural effusion is not excluded. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
