Patient is status post median sternotomy. Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the proximal right atrium, unchanged. Marked cardiomegaly is unchanged. Masses within the left upper lobe and left suprahilar region appear grossly unchanged as does widening of the superior mediastinal contour due to known lymphadenopathy. There is moderate pulmonary edema, worse in the interval. Small bilateral pleural effusions appear relatively unchanged. Known left lower lobe lung mass is not well visualized on the current radiograph. Patchy opacities within the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
