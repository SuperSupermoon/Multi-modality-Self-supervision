1. Interval worsening of opacification in the right mid zone. Differential diagnosis includes hemorrhage and/or infection. CHF is considered less likely, given the focality of the abnormality. 2. Patchy opacities in the right upper zone, similar to the prior film. Probable small right effusion, not significantly changed. 3. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, slightly worse. 4. CHF findings, likely slightly worse. 5. No pneumothorax detected.
