Moderate right pleural effusion is larger. There is still substantial could consolidation at the right lung base, which has changed in distribution, improved centrally, possibly worsened peripherally. Findings are still concerning for pneumonia, but not pulmonary edema, although moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Left lung is clear. Right PIC line still ends in the low SVC.
