Lung volumes remain low with layering bilateral effusions and bibasilar airspace opacities which are not significantly changed and may reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Left apical linear opacity likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.
