The bulk of the stomach is herniated into the right hemithorax and massively distended with air. Compared to the scout radiograph on the ___ Torso CT from ___, the distension of the subdiaphragmatic portion once equally severe has improved a little after placement of enteric tube ending in the debris filled distal stomach in the left upper quadrant. The abrupt tapering of the subdiaphragmatic stomach, the absence of bowel gas more distally in small or large gut, and the interim emptying of colonic gas indicate obstruction in the region of the pylorus, by stricture, volvulus, adhesion, abscess, or mass. Aside from the right lower lung atelectasis due to the herniated stomach, the lungs are grossly clear. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The thoracic aorta is calcified and tortuous. Cardiomegaly and pulmonary hypertension are well depicted in the Torso CT. Vascular clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior cholecystectomy.
