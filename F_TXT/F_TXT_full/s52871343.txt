Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted. The patient's known spiculated 1.5 cm right lower lobe lesion is partially obscured on this study. Right basilar opacities appear worsened since the prior study. There is probably also a concurrent small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Irregular nodular opacities in the upper lobes are probably slightly improved. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is stable. Dense aortic knob calcifications are seen. Enlargement of the hila bilaterally is compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
