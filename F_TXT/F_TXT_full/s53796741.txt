Single portable view of the chest. Left chest wall pacing device seen. Degree of cardiomegaly is unchanged. Engorged central pulmonary vasculature is again noted. Please note that motion artifact somewhat limits this exam. However, the lungs are clear of confluent consolidation. Opacity at the costophrenic angles, particularly on the right may be due to overlying soft tissues and atelectasis.
