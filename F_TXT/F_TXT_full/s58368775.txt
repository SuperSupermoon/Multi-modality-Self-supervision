Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with subsegmental atelectasis. Developing consolidation at this region is not entirely excluded. There is some hazy opacity at the right base which is unchanged. There is no pneumothoraces or signs for pulmonary edema. Embolization coils are seen projecting over the spleen.
