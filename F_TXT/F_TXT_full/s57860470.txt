Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate improved right pleural effusion status post Pleurx tube placement. Pleurx tube appears to be in the right chest. There is no pneumothorax or other complication seen. Low lung volumes are seen, likely due to poor inspiration. Previously described right lung radiation changes are again seen. Mild cardiomegaly is seen. PICC line is again seen in the mid to lower SVC.
