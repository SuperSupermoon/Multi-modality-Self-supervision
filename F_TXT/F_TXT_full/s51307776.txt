As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased and the size of the cardiac silhouette has increased. New bilateral pleural effusions as well as signs of interstitial fluid overload are present. In addition, there are is perihilar haze and an increase in diameters of the vascular structures. Overall, these findings are strongly suggestive of pulmonary edema. In addition, new parenchymal opacities are seen in the retrocardiac lung regions and at the right lung bases. These could potentially suggest the presence of pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
