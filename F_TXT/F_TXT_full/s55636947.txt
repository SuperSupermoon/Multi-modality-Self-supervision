Lung volumes remain low. The patient is intubated, the endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the level of the carina. A Swan-Ganz catheter is in-situ, this appears to have been withdrawn slightly when compared to the prior study but appears in appropriate position. There are bilateral chest tubes as well as the mediastinal drain in-situ. A nasogastric tube is unchanged in position. . No pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen. There are patchy airspace opacities throughout both lungs with more prominent on the right than the left likely reflecting asymmetric pulmonary edema. This is grossly unchanged compared to the prior studies.
