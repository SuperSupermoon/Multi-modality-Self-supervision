The AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study from ___ obtained at 10:14 p.m. The ET tube tip is approximately 2.7 cm above the carina although partially obscured by the Dobbhoff tube, thus re-checking with slightly oblique radiograph is recommended. The left PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Bibasal consolidations appear to be more pronounced on the current examination. Prominence of the pulmonary artery might be consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
