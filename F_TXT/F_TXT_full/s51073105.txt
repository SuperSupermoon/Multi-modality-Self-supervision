Linear basilar opacities appear similar compared to prior, particularly within the lingular region, findings consistent with scarring. Findings correlate with concurrent chest CT, please see report for details. No confluent consolidation is evident. There is no pneumothorax. No vascular congestion, overt edema, or large pleural effusions are identified. A prosthetic aortic valve is in unchanged standard position. Median sternotomy wires appear grossly intact on this single frontal view. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits.
