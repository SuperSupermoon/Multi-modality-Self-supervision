Left lower lobe is still collapsed, reflected in persistent leftward mediastinal shift and dense left infrahilar consolidation obscuring the diaphragmatic pleural interface. Small accompanying left pleural effusion is unchanged. Right lung is clear, hyperinflated in compensation. Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC. Spinal stabilization hardware is not evaluated by this slightly turned and should be evaluated clinically to see if it is appropriately supported and positionned.
