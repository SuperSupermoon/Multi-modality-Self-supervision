The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 5.9 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric catheter ends within the mid-to-upper thoracic esophagus. A new left pleural tube ends at the left lung apex. Evaluation for interval change in the known left pneumothorax is difficult given the supine technique, although no definite pneumothorax is identified. There has been interval right upper lobe collapse, likely secondary to mucus plugging. Consolidative opacities in the posterior aspects of the right upper and bilateral lower lobes seen on CT from earlier today are not well appreciated on the current study. The heart size is normal. Left hemothorax is not well evaluated, thought to be pooling in the posterior sulcus. Bilateral rib fractures were fully discussed on the recent CT torso.
