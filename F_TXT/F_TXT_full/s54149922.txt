1. Interval removal of right subclavian central line with no evidence of a pneumothorax. The feeding tube remains coiled within the expected location of the stomach. There is persistent patchy opacity at the right base with an associated effusion likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. There is likely a smaller left effusion with some streaky linear opacities at the left base likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Right fourth and fifth posterior old rib fractures with no acute bony abnormality appreciated. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
