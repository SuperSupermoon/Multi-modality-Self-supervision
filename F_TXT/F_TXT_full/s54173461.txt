The right lung is clear. The left lung again demonstrates a rounded left apical opacity, which is not significantly changed compared with prior CT and represents a loculated pleural effusion. Small amount of left pleural fluid is also noted at the base in this patient who is status post pleurodesis. Left hilar opacity is compatible with known mass, and streaky opacity within the left lung base radiating from the hilum is unchanged, likely reflective of atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
