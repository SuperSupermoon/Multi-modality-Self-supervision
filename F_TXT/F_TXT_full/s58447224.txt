Small right pneumothorax is unchanged. Small-to-moderate right effusion has increased with increasing adjacent atelectasis. Moderate left effusion is smaller-to-decreased, likely due to change in the position of the patient. Cardiomediastinal contours are partially obscured by the bibasilar opacities and pleural effusions. Opacities surrounding the right surgical chain in the upper lung have improved.
