Bibasilar consolidation which developed between ___ and ___ is unchanged. Whether this is atelectasis alone, as it might be in the left lower lobe, or atelectasis in combination with pneumonia is difficult to say but infection should be considered until proved otherwise. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There is no longer any upper lobe pulmonary vascular engorgement. Small left pleural effusion is presumed. No pneumothorax. ET tube, partially obscured by overlying devices, is in standard position, and an esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC.
