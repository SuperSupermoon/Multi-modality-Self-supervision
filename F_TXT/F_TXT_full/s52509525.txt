Comparison is made to previous study performed four hours earlier. The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and central line are unchanged. There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally. There is some improved aeration in the left lung; however, this can be partially due to rotation. No pneumothoraces are seen.
