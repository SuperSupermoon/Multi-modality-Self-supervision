The lung volumes are low. The patient is status post sternotomy. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably unchanged, although cardiac contours are not well delineated due to low lung volumes. There are patchy basilar opacities, greater on the left than right, which obscure the left hemidiaphragm. There is also mild perihilar fullness and opacification.
