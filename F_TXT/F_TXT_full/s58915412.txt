Comparison is made with prior study performed three hours earlier. NG tube tip now is in the stomach in a standard position. There are persistent low lung volumes. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube is in standard position. Mild vascular congestion has minimally increased. Opacities in the left lung are a combination of atelectasis and layering pleural effusion. If any, there is a small right pleural effusion. There are no other acute interval changes.
