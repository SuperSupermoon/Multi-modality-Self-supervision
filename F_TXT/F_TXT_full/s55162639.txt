Lung volumes are low. There is opacification of the right lower lobe silhouetting the diaphragm. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is severe cardiomegaly with unchanged mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are grossly unremarkable. Incidental note is made of superior subluxation of the right humeral head, which is unchanged and likely related to chronic rotator cuff pathology.
