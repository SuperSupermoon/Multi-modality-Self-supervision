As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of a relatively large perihilar opacity on the left, suspicious to reflect pneumonia. The radial transparency of the right lung base has shown on going improvement, with only a remnant right basilar atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No pneumothorax. The right PICC line has been slightly pulled back and now projects over the mid to lower SVC.
