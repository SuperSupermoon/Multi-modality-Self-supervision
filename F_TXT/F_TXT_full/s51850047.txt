An endotracheal tube terminates 3.1 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Increased interstitial prominence is most consistent with mild interstitial edema, less likely an atypical infection. Clinical correlation is recommended. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
