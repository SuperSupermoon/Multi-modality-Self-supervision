Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There is moderate cardiomegaly. Transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in standard position, in the right atrium and right ventricle. Tracheostomy tube is in the standard position. HD catheter is in the standard position. There is no pneumothorax. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right side, are again noted. Right lower lobe opacities have increased, could be due to increasing consolidation or increasing in the pleural effusions. Left lower lobe consolidation is unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is stable.
