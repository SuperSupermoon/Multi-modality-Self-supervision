In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change in the appearance of the right chest tube and small apical pneumothorax. Continued opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm. Although this could merely represent pleural fluid and atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be seriously considered. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size. Indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
