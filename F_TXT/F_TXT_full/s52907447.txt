As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Minimal opacity at the level of the right cardiophrenic angle, potentially reflecting a pericardial fat pad or a pericardial cyst. No new parenchymal opacities have appeared in the lung parenchyma. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. The right-sided PICC line has been removed in the interval.
