Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 1.6 cm above the carina and could be withdrawn several centimeters for standard positioning. Other devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Rapid interval improvement of left retrocardiac opacity favors atelectasis, but coexisting pneumonia is possible in this region. Pulmonary vascular congestion with associated perihilar haziness and interstitial edema appear similar to the recent radiograph. Small left pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size.
