As compared with the prior study, the endotracheal tube is located 3 cm above the carina in satisfactory position. There has been interval placement of two chest tubes, without appreciable pneumothorax. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which is more pronounced than on the prior study. Lung volumes are low, without focal consolidation. Right basal atelectasis is appreciated. Bilateral rib fractures are again demonstrated, though poorly assessed due to rotation. What appears to be a left subclavian venous catheter terminates as before at the level of the confluence of brachiocephalic veins. What appears to be a left PICC or other small caliber catheter terminates at the level of the axilla. Calcified and unfolded tortuous aorta is noted. The heart is mildly enlarged.
