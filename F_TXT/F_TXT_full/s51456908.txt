AP chest compared to ___ through ___ and ___: Interstitial pulmonary edema is most readily appreciated in the left lung, new since ___. Right pleural effusion is stable and there is also reason to suspect focal consolidation in the right lower lung, presumably atelectasis, which is also present at the left lung base medially. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Right transjugular Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the descending right pulmonary artery, 2 cm beyond standard placement. No pneumothorax. Moderate left pleural effusion has also increased.
