Since the prior chest radiograph performed on ___, there is increasing left retrocardiac density, likely representing atelectasis. There is likely also atelectasis at the right lung base. Tiny right apical pneumothorax is now appreciated. No pneumothorax on the left. There is likely a small pleural effusion on the right. A small effusion on the left is difficult to exclude. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema along both lateral chest walls persists. Mildly displaced left lateral sixth rib fracture demonstrates no evidence of healing.
