Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Right-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating in the region of the distal SVC. There are low lung volumes. There is a linear left base opacity again seen, which most likely relates to atelectasis. There is new right base patchy opacity raising concern for infection although could also be due to aspiration. The left costophrenic angle is slightly blunted although to lesser extent than on the prior study. No large pleural effusion seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
