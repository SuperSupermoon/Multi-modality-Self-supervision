AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Extensive infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, which is worst in the right lung where it began on ___, has improved since ___ in all regions suggesting that the interval change is primarily due to improving edema. Areas of relative lucency in the right lung could be cavitation, or pneumonia around the bullae, in combination with uninvolved lung. The presence of cavitation per se, does not necessarily mean progression of an established pneumonia. Clinical condition is a much better parameter of progression of disease. CT scanning would be definitive if cavitation must be confirmed. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Heart size normal. ET tube, right subclavian line are in standard placements. An upper enteric drainage tube passes into a moderately distended stomach and out of view but an abdominal radiograph performed at the same time and reported separately shows the tip in the stomach.
