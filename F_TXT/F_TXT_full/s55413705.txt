Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. New heterogeneous opacity of the left lower lung is consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia. Right lung volume loss status post thoracotomy is similar to prior exam. Chain sutures overlying the lateral right lung and right hilum, and scarring of the right lung base are unchanged. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
