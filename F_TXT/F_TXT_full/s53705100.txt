Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality is more evenly distributed, more typical of pulmonary edema, slightly improved. Pleural effusion is presumed, but not substantial. No pneumothorax. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is stable. Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump abuts the aortic apex and should be withdrawn 3.5 cm for standard positioning. It should be noted that the balloon migrates with changes in patient position, particularly hip flexion. Ascending Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right descending pulmonary artery and should be advanced no further. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of a nondistended stomach.
