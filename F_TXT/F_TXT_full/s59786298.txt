Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier. There has been markedly interval decrease in size in left pleural effusions, now small. There is residual/ persistent large atelectasis in the left lower lobe. There is no evident pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with cardiomegaly. Right small pneumothorax is unchanged. Right pigtail catheter is in unchanged position. Aeration of the right lower lobe and right middle lobe has improved.
