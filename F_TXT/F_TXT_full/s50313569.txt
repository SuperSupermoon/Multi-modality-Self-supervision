The lungs are hyperinflated. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. No focal consolidation, left-sided pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is noted. There is mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle which could suggest a trace pleural effusion or chronic pleural thickening. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
