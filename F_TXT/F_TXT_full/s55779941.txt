AP chest compared to earlier postoperative study on ___: Endotracheal tube has been removed, accounting in part for lower lung volumes, and increase in the cardiomediastinal silhouette, but moderate right pleural effusion is appreciably larger, there is mild interstitial edema and therefore vascular engorgement and cardiac decompensation are presumed. Right jugular sheath is sharply folded as it enters the neck, ending in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax. Stomach is at least moderately distended with air. Dr. ___ was paged at 4:30 p.m.
