Chronic changes are again seen in the lateral right upper lobe. Again, there is prominence of the interstitial markings seen, slightly less as compared to the most recent prior study, which may relate to pulmonary edema and/or chronic lung disease. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
