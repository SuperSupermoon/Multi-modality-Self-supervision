The lung apices are not included on this study. A large diameter right-sided central catheter terminates in the right atrium. A left-sided central catheter terminates in the mid SVC. An NG tube has its side port terminating in stomach however the tip travels inferiorly terminating out of few. Low lung volumes are unchanged. There is bilateral mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. The small left pleural effusion is improved. The right hemidiaphragm is obscured suggesting layering pleural effusion, atelectasis, or pulmonary infarct. There are no new focal opacities. Incompletely visualized coiled tubular structure in the upper esophagus is redemonstrated, and was previously described to be a temperature probe.
