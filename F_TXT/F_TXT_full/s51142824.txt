A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Since 7:18 a.m., there is no interval change in the right moderate pneumothorax and right basilar opacity in the partially collapsed lung with a pigtail catheter in the right lateral costophrenic sulcus. There is no evidence of tension. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus may represent a tiny effusion. No left pneumothorax.
