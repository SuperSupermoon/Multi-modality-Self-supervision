In comparison with study of ___, there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with severe pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacification with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm suggests volume loss in the left lower lobe. Central catheter remains in place. On this and the most recent plain radiograph, there appears to be prominent sclerosis of the ribs. Although this could merely reflect overlying pulmonary changes, the possibility of metastatic disease should be considered and these structures should be carefully checked when the congestion improves. Another possibility would be hyperparathyroidism secondary to the patient's known chronic renal disease, but there is no evidence of the characteristic rugger-___ spine in the dorsal region.
