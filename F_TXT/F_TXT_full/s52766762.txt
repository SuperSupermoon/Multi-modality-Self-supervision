In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. The chest tube remains in place without definite pneumothorax. Post-surgical changes are seen on the left with elevation of the hemidiaphragm and probable fluid along the lateral chest wall and costophrenic angle. Widening of the mediastinum persists, though is less prominent than on the previous examination. No evidence of vascular congestion. There has been some reduction in the subcutaneous emphysema along the lateral chest wall on the left and in the lower left neck. The right lung is essentially clear.
