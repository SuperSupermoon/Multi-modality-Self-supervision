1. Interval extubation. Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC. Interval appearance of patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region, likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of a small effusion. The patchy opacity at the right base is unchanged. However, there is increasing perihilar fullness and suggestion ___ ___'s lines in the right lung. These findings favor interval development of mild perihilar and interstitial edema. Heart remains enlarged. Aorta is unfolded and tortuous. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
