There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular catheter with the tip still in the right internal jugular vein. There appears to be a kink in the mid portion of the catheter on this single view. Please correlate clinically with catheter functioning. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. Findings discussed with Dr. ___ by phone at 12:10am on ___. She informed me that this is a venous catheter.
