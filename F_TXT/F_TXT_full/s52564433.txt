1. Interval improvement in aeration throughout both lungs, suggesting resolving pulmonary edema. There continues to be a layering right effusion. The left lung is hyperinflated. More focal consolidation at the right base persists which may reflect compressive atelectasis, though superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. Heart remains stably enlarged with a cardiac stent in place. Mediastinal contours are unchanged and within normal limits. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall, there has been improvement in the degree of pulmonary edema.
