The left subclavian PICC line has its tip now projecting in the azygos vein were previously it had its tip in the distal SVC. The tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The overall cardiac and mediastinal contours remains stably enlarged. Given the globular configuration to the cardiac shadow, a pericardial effusion should also be considered. There is persistent but improving pulmonary edema. Layering bilateral effusions with bibasilar opacities suggest compressive atelectasis in the setting of pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
