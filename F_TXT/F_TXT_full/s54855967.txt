The heart is mildly enlarged. There is unfolding of the thoracic aorta. Within the limitations of technique, including low lung volumes, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are likely within normal range. The upper mediastinum and medial lung apices are obscured by the chin flexion. A mild diffuse interstitial abnormality suggests minimal fluid overload. Patchy left basilar opacity is most compatible with atelectasis. There is no definite pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The bones appear demineralized. There is a compression deformity along the lower thoracic spine, which is incompletely characterized. A surgical clip projects over the right upper quadrant.
