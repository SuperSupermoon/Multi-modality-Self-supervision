An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating at the thoracic inlet, approximately 4.6-cm above the carina. An enteric tube is in place coursing below the diaphragm with the tip terminating in the left upper quadrant, likely within the gastric fundus. The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Atelectasis is noted in both lung bases. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
