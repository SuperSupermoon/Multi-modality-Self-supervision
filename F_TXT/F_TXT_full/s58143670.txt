As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Relatively low lung volumes with parenchymal opacities at both lung bases, right more than left. The extent of the opacity is stable since the previous examination. Moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
