Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above the carina and could be advanced a few centimeters for standard positioning. Marked interval improvement in previously present right middle and right lower lobe atelectasis, with residual atelectasis remaining, predominantly involving the right lower lobe. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by interstitial edema, likely superimposed upon chronic lung abnormalities, including upper lobe predominant emphysema and mild basilar scarring/fibrosis. No pneumothorax.
