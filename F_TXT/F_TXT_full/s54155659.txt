The patient is leftward rotated limiting the evaluation. However, the ET tube is approximately 5 cm from the carina with the chin elevated. Enteric tube courses in the esophagus to the level of the left hemidiaphragm and then beyond the field of view. Lung volumes are low. There is worsening atelectasis at the right base. The left costophrenic sulcus and the inferior tip of the right costophrenic sulcus are omitted from view. Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes and likely normal. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
