Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of clavicle, approximately 5.5cm above the carina. Consider advancing ETT by ___-20 mm for a better seating. A dual-lumen catheter through the right subclavian approach ends at mid SVC. A Swan-Ganz catheter through the left internal jugular approach ends approximately at the level of the main pulmonary artery. Orogastric tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, distal end is beyond the radiograph view. Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema has further improved. Left lower lung atelectasis reflected by increased retrocardiac density and small left pleural effusion is similar. Two abdominal drains are seen, one in the epigastric region and another in the right hypochondriac region, unchanged in course and position.
