Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5 cm above the level of the carina. There are diffuse bilateral airspace opacities with a relative perihilar distribution, most suggestive of pulmonary edema, however, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed infection is not excluded. There is minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles which could relate to trace effusions or pleural thickening. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The aortic arch is calcified.
