Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and accompanied by new pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral asymmetrically distributed perihilar opacities, likely due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema. This is worse on the right than the left. Previously described peripheral right basilar opacity is less apparent than on the previous study, but is difficult to assess in the setting of new acute findings. Small pleural effusions have also developed, left greater than right. Given clinical suspicion for pneumonia, followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful to distinguish asymmetrical edema from infection.
