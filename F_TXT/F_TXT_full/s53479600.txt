Severe consolidation throughout the entire right lung has worsened consistent with progressive pneumonia. Mild rightward mediastinal shift and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm reflect volume loss in the consolidated right lung, particularly the upper lobe, probably due to retained secretions in poor aeration. The left lung is generally clear although there may be retrocardiac consolidation. There is no appreciable left pleural effusion. Small right pleural effusion is present. A vascular stent in the right jugular vein and superior vena cava has not migrated over the course of more than a year. Patient has had median sternotomy, but it is unclear for what type of surgery.
