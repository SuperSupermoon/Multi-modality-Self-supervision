The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. A right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid/low SVC. Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. No pulmonary edema is demonstrated. There is minimal atelectasis in the right lung base. No focal consolidation, or pneumothorax is identified. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally suggests trace bilateral pleural effusions.
