Left chest tube has been removed. Small biapical pneumothoraces are stable compared to most recent prior film. The opacities in bilateral mid lung zone are similar, allowing for technical differences. Tracheostomy tube and right PICC line with tip over distal SVC again noted. No gross effusion. Right convex curvature in the upper thoracic spine is noted, but may relate to supine positioning.
