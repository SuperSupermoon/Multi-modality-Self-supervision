Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates tracheostomy in standard position and multiple intact median sternotomy wires. A right PICC has low lying tip, which resides 6 cm below the carina. This is minimally changed as compared to prior exam. There are increased interstitial opacities in the right lung, compatible with pulmonary edema. A small right effusion is present. A previously seen left pleural effusion has largely resolved: Improved but residual retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Mildly prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
