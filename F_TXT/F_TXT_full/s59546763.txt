In comparison to the most recent prior study, there is improved aeration at the right lung base with improved definition of the right hemidiaphragm and right heart border suggesting decreased atelectasis and pleural fluid. The left lung remains clear without pleural effusion or focal consolidation. No pneumothorax is present. The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated compatible with prior right lung resection. There is decreased but persistent mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains prominently enlarged but stable. Surgical clips project to the right of the trachea, compatible with prior lung resection.
