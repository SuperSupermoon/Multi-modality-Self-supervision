Compared to prior study low lung volumes are persistent. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacities have increased these could represent atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Right lower lobe opacities have improved. There are probably small bilateral effusions. There is no evident pneumothorax. Sternal wires are aligned. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Cervical hardware is again noted. Mild vascular congestion is unchanged
