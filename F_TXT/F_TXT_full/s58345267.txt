As compared to the previous radiograph, there is now a mild to moderate left pleural effusion as well as a left retrocardiac atelectasis. The atelectasis in the left midlung zone, seen on the previous examination, is no longer visible. The lung volumes remain low and the size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal. The signs indicative of pulmonary edema are still present. The patient is strongly rotated to the right, which limits the evaluation of the examination.
