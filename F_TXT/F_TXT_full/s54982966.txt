In comparison with the study of ___, there is a left chest tube in place. No definite apical pneumothorax. There is a thin line adjacent to the upper left portion of the cardiac silhouette. This conceivably could represent a small medial pneumothorax. Opacification at the left base is consistent with postoperative changes and atelectasis. Of incidental note is a total shoulder arthroplasty on the left. The right lung remains essentially clear.
