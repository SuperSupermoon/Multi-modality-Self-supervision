Cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta are unchanged. Esophageal stent is in place. Poorly defined opacity in right upper lobe is apparently new from prior chest CT and is not fully characterized on this portable radiograph. Followup PA and lateral radiographs of the chest would be helpful to further characterize this finding and to help differentiate acute aspiration from an evolving infectious process. Exam is otherwise remarkable for small left pleural effusion and adjacent left basilar atelectasis.
