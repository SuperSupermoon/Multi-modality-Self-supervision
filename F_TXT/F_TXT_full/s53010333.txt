Somewhat technically limited study shows no evidence of appreciable pneumothorax. When compared to the study of ___, there is increased opacification at the bases with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms. This could reflect some layering pleural fluid with volume loss in the lower lobes, as well as streaks of plate-like atelectasis. Engorgement of pulmonary vessels suggests elevated pulmonary venous pressure as well. There is a tracheal tube with its tip above the superior level of the clavicles, approximately 5.3 cm above the carina.
