Lung volumes are decreased with congestion and indistinctness of pulmonary vasculature and presence of septal lines compatible with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Small effusions may also be present along with more dense opacity at left greater than right base, likely atelectasis. Heart size is mildly enlarged.
