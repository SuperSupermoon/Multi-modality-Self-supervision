The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. A pigtail drainage catheter has been placed in the lower left pleural space. The large majority of a loculated pleural effusion has been drained with a moderate residual quantity and parenchymal opacity which can probably be attributable to atelectasis, although an infectious etiology is not excluded by this study. Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear. A small pleural effusion on the right is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
