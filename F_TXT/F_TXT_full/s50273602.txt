A right subclavian PICC line is present, tip overlying the distal SVC. The patient is status post sternotomy. There is upper zone re-distribution, without other evidence of CHF. There is minimal patchy atelectasis in the retrocardiac and cardiophrenic regions. No definite infiltrate. No effusion. Right hemidiaphragm is elevated, with underlying loops of air-filled bowel. Vascular calcifications noted. Compared with ___, upper zone re-distribution is slightly more prominent, but no frank CHF is seen. Bibasilar atelectasis is also slightly more prominent. Gas-filled loops of bowel underneath the right hemidiaphragm are not fully evaluated. Clinical correlation is requested for further assessment. Is there any concern for ileus or obstruction?
