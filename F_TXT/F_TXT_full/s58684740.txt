1. Interval placement of a right PICC line with its tip in the mid-to-distal SVC in satisfactory position. Lungs remain hyperinflated suggesting underlying emphysema. There continues to be a left apical calcified mass with some associated left apical pleural thickening. The left apical pleural thickening appears somewhat more prominent than in ___, which although this may be related to projectional differences, clinical correlation would be advised as these findings are consistent with prior granulomatous infection. A surgical clip is again seen in the soft tissues of the right axilla. The lungs appear grossly clear. No pleural effusions. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. No pneumothorax.
