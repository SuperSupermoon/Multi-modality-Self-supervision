Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Diffuse airspace opacities in the right lung with relative sparing of the right apex are slightly improved and likely due to diffuse infection. Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion but improvement in extent of interstitial edema. Poorly defined opacities at left lung base could reflect dependent edema or potentially additional site of infection. Attention to this region on short term followup radiograph may be helpful in this regard.
