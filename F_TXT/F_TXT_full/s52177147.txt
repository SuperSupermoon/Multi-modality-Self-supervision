Since the prior examination, there are low lung volumes. Even accounting for decreased lung volumes, there is increased diffuse opacification, more prominent within the lower lobes, compatible with worsening disease. An enteric feeding tube is demonstrated coursing below the diaphragm. There is no evidence of pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Pulmonary vascularity is not increased.
