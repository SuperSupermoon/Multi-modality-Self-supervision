As compared to the previous image, the tip of the endotracheal tube has been slightly advanced, the tip now projects 4 cm above the carina. The course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged. The tip is incompletely visualized but continues to be coiled in the stomach. In the interval, the right internal jugular vein catheter was removed. The course and position of the left PICC line is constant. Decrease in extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion, with increased transparency of the lung parenchyma. Slight decrease in extent and severity of the pre-existing multifocal parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting multifocal pneumonia.
