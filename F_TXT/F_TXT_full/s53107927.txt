In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there are continued low lung volumes which may account for the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. However, there is no evidence of pneumothorax or vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. Left hemidiaphragm is not well seen on this study, suggesting volume loss in the left lower lobe.
