Large right pleural effusion persists with associated lung volume loss. Small left pleural effusion with basilar atelectasis is also seen. No pulmonary edema or focal consolidation is seen, and the cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. A Swan-Ganz catheter is in appropriate position, and a nasogastric tube curls in the stomach. ET tube is low in the trachea and is susceptible to malposition into a bronchus. Intraperitoneal drain is seen in the right upper quadrant abdomen.
