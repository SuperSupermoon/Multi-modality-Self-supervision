CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.Comparison to ___ chest x-ray from ___. Review of the report from the ___ chest CT refers to stable pulmonary nodules, emphysema and evidence of prior granulomatous exposure. Rotated positioning. The cardiomediastinal silhouette shows straightening of the left heart border and mild unfolding of the aorta, but is grossly unchanged. No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is identified. There is minimal atelectasis or scarring at both lung bases, similar to prior. No pneumothorax is detected. Linear density overlying the right upper lung is noted, ? outside of patient. The tracheal air column slightly obscured due to rotation, but appears grossly patent. Based on correlation with prior CT, air seen immediately above the left mainstem bronchus lies within the esophagus. Compared to ___, there is a new, small (8.8 mm) metallic-type radiodensity overlying the left upper abdomen. Clinical correlation is requested. IMPRESSION 1) New radio-density in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. This is nonspecific, but the differential diagnosis could include dental amalgam. Clinical correlatino is requested. 2) Assessment of tracheal air column limited, but grossly unremarkable. 3) Minimal bibasilar atelectasis/scarring, similar to prior. No acute pulmonary process identified. No ptx detected.
