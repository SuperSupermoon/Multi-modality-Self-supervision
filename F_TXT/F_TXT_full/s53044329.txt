Comparison is made with prior study, ___. New large retrocardiac opacity is consistent with atelectasis. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pneumothorax. If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions. Left upper lobe and right lower lobe opacities are unchanged, likely infection. Followup until resolution is recommended.
