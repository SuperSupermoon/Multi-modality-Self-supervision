Right upper lobe focal consolidation is unchanged since ___, but worse than ___. A left upper lobe focal consolation is more conspicuous today; those confluent opacities could reflect multifocal pneumonia. The remaining of the exam is unchanged with a right-sided PICC line ending in lower SVC, moderate bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis. Cardiac congestion is probably overestimated due to the pulmonary emphysema. There is no pneumothorax.
