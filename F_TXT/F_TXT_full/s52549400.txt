Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved. Persistent right lower lobe opacity could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusion. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper-to-mid SVC.
