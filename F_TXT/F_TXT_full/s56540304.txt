As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have improved, reflecting better ventilation or increased ventilatory pressures. However, the extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, predominating in the mid and lower lung zones, are constant. Moderate atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions and at the lung bases. No larger pleural effusions. The position of the endotracheal tube is constant.
