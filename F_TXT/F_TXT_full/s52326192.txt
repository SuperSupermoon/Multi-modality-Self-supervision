1. Right subclavian central line with its tip in the distal SVC. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach.

The lungs demonstrate interval improvement in aeration with residual patchy opacity at the right base likely reflecting residual atelectasis. Probable small right effusion. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
