There is atelectasis or scarring at the lateral left lung base. Lungs are otherwise well expanded and clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is top-normal. Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are unremarkable, noting dense calcifications about the aortic knob. An enteric tube appears to terminate near the GE junction without entering the stomach. The stomach is severely dilated and filled with gas, similar to the same day outside hospital CT.
