Overall no significant interval change from the most recent exam. Bilateral extensive opacities, most prominent in the perihilar regions, could be secondary to pulmonary edema and underlying pneumonia. Some degree of pulmonary hemorrhage given the clinical history is also possible. Mild cardiomegaly is overall unchanged. No pneumothorax. Superimposed plate pleural effusions are likely but difficult to fully assess on a background bilateral increased opacities.
