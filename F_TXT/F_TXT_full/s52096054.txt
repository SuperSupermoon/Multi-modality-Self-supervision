Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained. The apically directed left chest tube has been withdrawn such that it now terminates in the superior left apex with at most minimal residual pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion with persistent blunting of right costophrenic sulcus and right basilar atelectasis is unchanged. The heart and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
