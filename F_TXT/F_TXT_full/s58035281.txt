As compared to the previous radiograph, a nasogastric tube was inserted. The tip is located at the distal portion of the new esophagus. The other monitoring and support devices are in constant position, except for the removal of the endotracheal tube. The lung volumes have returned to knee and normal conditions. Bilateral postoperative atelectasis are seen at the lung bases. No larger pleural effusions.
