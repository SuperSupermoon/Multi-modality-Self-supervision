Radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessment of a nasogastric tube, which coils within the upper stomach, with distal tip directed cephalad in the region of the fundus. Within the imaged portion of the chest, cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Widespread pulmonary metastases are again demonstrated, but previously described superimposed pulmonary edema has nearly resolved.
