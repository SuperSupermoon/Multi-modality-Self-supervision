Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. There is a right IJ central venous catheter with its tip in the region of the right atrium. The heart size is difficult to assess. There is probable mitral annular calcification. Lung volumes are low. Evaluation of the left lower lobe is limited due to patient's leftward rotation. No definite opacification is seen in the right lung. Bony structures appear intact, though demineralized. There is a sclerotic focus in the right humeral head/neck, likely an enchondroma or medullary infarct.
