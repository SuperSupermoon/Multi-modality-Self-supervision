Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and right-sided IJ line which are unchanged in position. There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities which have worsened slightly, particularly at the right base. Findings are more suspicious for infectious process as opposed to pulmonary edema. There are no pneumothoraces. No pleural effusions are seen on either side.
