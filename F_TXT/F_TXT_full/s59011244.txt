Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier. Small right pneumothorax is unchanged. Small-to-moderate left effusion has minimally increased. Right lower lobe atelectasis has minimally increased. There is no left pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are obscured by the left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Severe right scoliosis is again noted. Opacities surrounding the surgical chain in the right upper lung are grossly unchanged. There are no other changes. Right chest tube is not visualized.
