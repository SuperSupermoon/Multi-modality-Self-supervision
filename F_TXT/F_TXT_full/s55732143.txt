Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval placement of an enteric tube that is seen in the stomach, but its tip extends beyond the inferior margin of the image. The endotracheal tube is located approximately 3.8 cm from the carina. There are diffuse patchy opacities that is likely a combination of mild pulmonary edema and bronchovascular crowding from low lung volumes. There are no large pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax. The heart is mildly enlarged. No acute osseous abnormalities.
