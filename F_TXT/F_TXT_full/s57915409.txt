A right internal jugular large-bore catheter and feeding tube are unchanged in position. A left basilar chest tube remains in place. A left subclavian introducer is also unchanged. There is a stable small left apicolateral pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable status post median sternotomy with CABG. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflecting a small effusion and/or pleural thickening. Streaky patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region likely reflects resolving partial lower lobe atelectasis. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
