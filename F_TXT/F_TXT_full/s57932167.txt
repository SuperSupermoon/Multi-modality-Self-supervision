In comparison with the study of ___, all of the monitoring and support devices have been removed in this patient with valve replacement and intact midline sternal wires. Little change in the degree of widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is continued indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. An area of patchy opacification is seen in the right mid zone laterally with blunting of the costophrenic angle. Some of this may reflect pleural fluid, though the possibility of supervening pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
