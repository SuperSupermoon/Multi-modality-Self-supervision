AP portable supine view of the chest. Leftward rotation limits assessment. Lung volumes are markedly low. Kyphotic angulation of the chest with scoliotic deformity also somewhat limits evaluation. Allowing for limitations, the left lung appears clear. There is likely a retrocardiac gas containing structure suggesting hiatal hernia. Right basal opacity may represent a small pleural effusion. No supine evidence for pneumothorax. No definite fracture. Heart size difficult to assess. Mediastinal contour grossly unremarkable though not fully characterized. A compression deformity is noted in the lower thoracic spine, most likely chronic.
