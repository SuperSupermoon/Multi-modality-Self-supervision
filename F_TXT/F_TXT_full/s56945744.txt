Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. A dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. There are overlying left-sided pleural plaques. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is again seen, which most likely relates to pleural thickening/pleural fat as seen on prior CT from ___; however, trace pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. No definite focal consolidation is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
