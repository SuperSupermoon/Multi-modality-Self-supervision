Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. A single-lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen with lead unchanged in position, extending to the expected location of the right ventricle. The lungs are hyperinflated. There is fluid in the minor fissure. There are also persistent bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Bilateral perihilar opacities left greater than right may be related to pulmonary edema, although in the appropriate clinical setting, underlying infection is not excluded.
