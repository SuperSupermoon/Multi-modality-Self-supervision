There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 6.3 cm at the level of the carina. There has also been interval placement of enteric tube, not well seen beyond the mid to distal thorax, although this may relate to technique. Suggest repeat with centering slightly lower. Again there is bibasilar and lingular atelectasis. Perihilar opacities have decreased in the interval, which may relate to the improved inspiration as compared to the prior study. There may be slight increase in left base opacity, but this may be due to atelectasis or possible small amount of aspiration.
