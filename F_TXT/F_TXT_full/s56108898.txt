Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from earlier the same day. There is a new right-sided pigtail catheter identified projecting over the right mid thorax. Right-sided pneumothorax is not clearly identified based on this portable supine film. Lungs are again notable for faint bibasilar opacities compatible with laceration/contusions. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
