In comparison to the prior chest radiograph performed yesterday evening, there has been no interval change in positioning of the left sided PICC line, which still terminates at the right brachiocephalic vein, possibly entering the right internal jugular vein. Substantial left-sided pleural effusion with compression atelectasis is unchanged.
