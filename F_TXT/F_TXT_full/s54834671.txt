Interval placement of nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm and has its tip and side port projecting over the stomach. Endotracheal tube has its tip 2.5 cm above the carina. A right hemodialysis catheter is unchanged in position. Overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. Decrease in the right paratracheal soft tissues suggesting that the finding on the prior study ___ at 00:13 did represent dilated venous structures. There is persistent patchy opacity at both bases, left greater than right, which could reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered in the correct clinical setting. No pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax.
