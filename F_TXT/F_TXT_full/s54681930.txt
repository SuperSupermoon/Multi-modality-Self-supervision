Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a left-sided central line whose distal lead tip has now migrated several centimeters more proximally. There is also a single loop projecting over the lower neck. This could be readjusted and has been disussed with ICU nurse, ___ at 9:25 AM ___. Tracheostomy is unchanged. There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities and consolidation, particularly of the right lung where there is air bronchograms. There is a small amount of aerated right lung at the base.
