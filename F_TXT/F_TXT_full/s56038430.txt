Single portable view of the chest. Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam. The lungs are clear. Faint opacity projecting over the right upper lung is due to overlying cardiac lead components. The lungs are otherwise clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Atherosclerotic calcifications again seen at the arch. No acute osseous abnormalities detected. Calcifications in the neck are likely vascular in origin.
