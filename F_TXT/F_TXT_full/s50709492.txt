In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a slightly better inspiration and there is now a tracheostomy tube in place with the right IJ catheter removed. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There is bilateral pulmonary opacifications, which could reflect non-cardiogenic vascular congestion or resolving ARDS. Some asymmetric increased opacification at the left base could reflect developing consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting, however, the opacifications from previous ARDS have consistently been more prominent on the left, so this may merely reflect the natural course of resolution.
