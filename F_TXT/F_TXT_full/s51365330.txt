Low lung volumes show opacification at the left base, most likely related to volume loss in the lower lobe. Poor definition of the left costophrenic angle is consistent with pleural fluid, and there may be some fluid and atelectasis at the right base as well. The apical region is not adequately seen on this study so that exposure to TB with resultant radiographic findings cannot be assessed.
