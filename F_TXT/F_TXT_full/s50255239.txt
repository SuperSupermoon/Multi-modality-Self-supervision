There is mild cardiomegaly. The left PICC tip projects in the same location by CXR, in prior CT it was in the azygos vein. There has been interval worsening of diffuse lung opacities. focal cavitary lung lesions are better seen in prior CT. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. I presumed there is a small layering right pleural effusion.
