Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Layering left effusion with associated airspace opacity may reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Patchy opacity at the right base likely represents atelectasis. There continues to be perihilar vascular congestion but no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
