Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increased consolidation at the bilateral bases, consistent with pulmonary edema superimposed on pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions are slightly increased in size. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The right internal jugular central venous terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax.
