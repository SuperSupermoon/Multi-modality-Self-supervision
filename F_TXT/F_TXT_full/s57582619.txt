Single AP view of the chest is provided. No pneumothoraces are seen. Lung volumes are low causing crowding of the bronchovascular structures. At the left lower lobe, there is an ill-defined opacity which could be consistent with an infectious process in the correct clinical setting, or aspiration. There is mild right basilar atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable.
