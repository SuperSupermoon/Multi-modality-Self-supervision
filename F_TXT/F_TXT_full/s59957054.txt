Large mass adjacent to the aortic arch is consistent with aortic arch pseudoaneurysm previously imaged by chest CTA in ___. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion. New diffuse heterogeneous opacities in the right lung could reflect asymmetrical pulmonary edema or acute aspiration event, and note is also made of a new patchy opacity at the left base. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are new.
