An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip terminates approximately 3.5 cm above the level the carina. A nasogastric tube is coiled in the proximal esophagus. Apparent mild cardiomegaly is likely due to the projection. Mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature likely due to fluid overload. No consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen.
