The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea. A gastric tube extends to the body of the stomach. Pacing leads are again noted overlying the right atrium and right ventricular apex with the battery pack projecting over the left hemi abdomen. Unchanged pacer leads along the left lateral chest. Slight interval decrease in the extent of the perihilar opacities. A persisting retrocardiac opacity is present, likely reflecting atelectasis and a pleural effusion. No pneumothorax identified.
