In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the mid to lower stomach, with the side port distal to the EG junction. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without appreciable vascular congestion. Retrocardiac opacification suggests mild atelectatic changes. No definite acute pneumonia, though this would be difficult to exclude in the retrocardiac region in the absence of a lateral view.
