An NG tube terminates below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach but the side port likely at the gastroesophageal junction. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The aorta is minimally tortuous. Streaky opacity at the base of the right lung likely reflects atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax, pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
