1. There has been interval intubation with placement of an endotracheal tube which has its tip at the thoracic inlet at approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular central line is unchanged. There has also been interval placement of a nasogastric tube that courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The predominantly bibasilar airspace process with associated effusions is essentially not significantly changed. However, the pulmonary vasculature is more prominent and this suggests that there is now worsening pulmonary edema. Post-operative changes in the right upper and lateral mid right lung are stable. Multiple calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are consistent with prior granulomatous infection. Lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema. The heart remains enlarged. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
