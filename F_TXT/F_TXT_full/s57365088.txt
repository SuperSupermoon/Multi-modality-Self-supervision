Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study with bibasal, layering pleural effusions. In addition, bile airspace opacities are noted, similar when compared to the prior study and likely reflecting pulmonary edema. A left-sided PICC terminates in the proximal SVC. A Dobhoff tube terminates in the distal stomach. No pneumothorax seen.
