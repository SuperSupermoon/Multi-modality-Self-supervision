As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The position of the PICC line is constant. Constant bilateral pigtail catheters. Atelectasis at both lung bases and low lung volumes, combine to a mild-to-moderate and probably loculated right pleural effusion. The size of the cardiac silhouette remains at the upper range of normal and the lung volumes remain low. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
