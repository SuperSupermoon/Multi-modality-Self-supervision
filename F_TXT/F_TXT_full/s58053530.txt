The ET tube is in unchanged position, terminating 2.8 cm above the carina. There has been interval advancement of previously visualized NG tube, with distal tip now in the stomach and side port just distal to the GE junction. The cardio mediastinal contours are stable. The bilateral hila stable in appearance. There has been mild interval improvement in interstitial opacities as compared to the radiograph taken at 03:28, most prominently in the left upper lobe, suggesting improvement in pulmonary edema. There is also development of an apparent haziness of the right hemidiaphragm which, in the setting of poor inspiratory effort low lung volumes, is likely crowding of vascular structures at the right lung base secondary to atelectasis; however, especially in the setting of NG tube insertion and repositioning, this may also represent interval aspiration. Attention to this area on next/ repeat chest x-ray. Similarly, there is also stable retrocardiac opacification which likely represents left lower lobe atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
