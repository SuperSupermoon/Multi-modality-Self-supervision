The right lung is clear with the exception of some discoid atelectasis in the lower lung fields. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax in the right. The patient is status post wedge resection of the left lower lobe. A chest tube is again noted ending in the left apex. A previously noted left sided pneumothorax has resolved in the interval, with loculated fluid occupying the space. The subcutaneous emphysema has also improved. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
