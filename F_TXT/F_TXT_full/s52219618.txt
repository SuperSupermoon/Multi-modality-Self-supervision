A new ETT is seen descending into the right mainstem bronchus and will need to be withdrawn by several cm. The previously noted predominantly fissure moderate right pleural effusion is improved. Swan-Ganz catheter and mediastinal drains and new right chest tube are appropriately placed. There has been interval removal of left drain catheter. Mediastinal widening is stable and consistent with recent vascular surgery. There is no pneumothorax or new pleural effusion.
