As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The internal jugular vein catheter on the right was pulled back. The tip of the catheter now projects over the cavoatrial junction. The appearance of the moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Unchanged position of the aortic valve replacement and of the sternal wires. The presence of a small pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Bilateral basal areas of atelectasis are not substantially changed. No new parenchymal opacities.
