As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. The size of the cardiac silhouette as well as the appearance of the hilar and mediastinal structures is constant. Minimal atelectatic changes could be present at the right lung base. However, if clinical suspicion for pulmonary infection persists, and given the higher sensitivity of CT for detecting this pathology in immunocompromised patients, CT of the chest is recommended to rule out pneumonia.
