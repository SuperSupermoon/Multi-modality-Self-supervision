Feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right subclavian central line is unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning. The left upper and mid lung remains relatively hyperlucent consistent with known emphysema as documented on chest CT dated ___. There is asymmetric increasing interstitial opacities throughout the right lung with prominent perihilar vasculature and an associated layering right effusion. Findings are most consistent with worsening asymmetric pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation is recommended. There may be a small layering left effusion. No pneumothorax.
