AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Overlying external artifact partially obscures the view. Subtle left perihilar opacity may be related to overlying artifact, although underlying subtle consolidation due to contusion in the setting of trauma is not excluded. The right lung appears clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No displaced fracture is seen.
