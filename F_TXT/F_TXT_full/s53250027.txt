Tracheostomy tube, right subclavian Port-A-Cath and left internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. The heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly although pericardial effusion should also be considered. There are layering pleural effusions, right greater than left. Bibasilar opacities are again seen likely reflecting lobar atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Overall, however, aeration in the right lung has improved. Low lung volumes with crowding of the vasculature and no overt pulmonary edema. Stable thoracolumbar curvature. Gastrostomy tube is in place.
