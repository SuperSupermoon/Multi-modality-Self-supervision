As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the right-sided chest tube is unchanged as compared to an outside hospital film from 11:56 p.m. A pneumothorax, if present, is minimal and limited to the very right lung apex. Otherwise, the right lung is well expanded. The pneumothorax seen on the pre-interventional outside chest film from 9:34 p.m. is no longer visible. Some of platelike atelectasis at the lateral aspect of the minor fissure is unchanged. Minimal elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Subtle pleural irregularities at the left lung apex. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.
