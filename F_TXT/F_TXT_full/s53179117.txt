As compared to the previous image, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately ___-15 mm above the carina, the tube could be pulled back by approximately 1-2 cm. Newly inserted nasogastric tube, the tip of which is not visible on the image, the course of the tube is unremarkable. The previously placed internal jugular vein catheter on the right has been pulled back by 2-3 cm but its tip still projects over the right atrium, further pullback of about 3 cm should be performed. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis. Minimal fluid overload but no evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
