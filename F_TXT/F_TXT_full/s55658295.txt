The lungs are well expanded. Prominent interstitial markings are seen in the lungs with linear right mid lung opacity suggestive of scarring. Overall findings may be due to chronic lung disease. The lungs are clear of consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but otherwise unremarkable. Median sternotomy wires are noted.
