There is a new left IJ line, the tip of the line overlies the multiple leads of the pacemaker and thus the full extent of the line is unclear. There is increased alveolar infiltrate, right greater than left with hazy opacity obscuring the entire right lung. There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. There is mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular redistribution. The overall impression is that of worsened pulmonary edema.
