In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Extensive reticular opacities are again seen throughout both lungs, again consistent with diffuse interstitial lung disease representing chronic pulmonary fibrosis. Chest CT would be necessary to further characterize this process. No definite pulmonary vascular congestion or superimposed pneumonia, though both of these would be somewhat difficult to evaluate given the extensive pulmonary changes.
