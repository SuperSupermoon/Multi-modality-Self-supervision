As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a Dobbhoff catheter. The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip of the catheter, however, is coiled in the stomach. The tip currently projects over the middle parts of the stomach. No complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, unchanged radiograph.
