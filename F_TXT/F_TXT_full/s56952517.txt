The study is limited by low lung volumes and slight lordotic positioning. The heart size appears mildly enlarged although this is difficult to reliably discern with lordotic positioning. There appears to be a widespread reticular densities with a background of pulmonary edema as noted by the prominent perihilar and basilar pulmonary vasculature. Small layering bilateral effusions are noted. There is no pneumothorax. There are multiple deformities of the right ribs. No acute bony process is identified.
