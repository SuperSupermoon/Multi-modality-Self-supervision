Single frontal portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen at the level of the clavicle, terminating 5.7 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, terminating in the proximal stomach. There is lucency along the left lateral lower hemithorax coursing below the level of the diaphragm as well as increased lucency along the left heart border, raising concern for pneumothorax. There is no evidence of tension. No definite rib fracture is identified. These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 3:55 p.m. on ___ via telephone three minutes after discovery. Additionally, there is right basilar opacity and obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm, which could be due to aspiration; however, underlying pulmonary contusion or small pleural effusion is not excluded.
