The left apical pneumothorax is smaller, with a pleural line projecting over the third posterior rib. The amount of subcutaneous emphysema has increased, suggesting air may be leaking instead of being evacuated by the left chest tube. The right lung is clear. Left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged. No evidence of bilateral layering pleural effusions. Unchanged left subclavian line terminating in the mid SVC.
