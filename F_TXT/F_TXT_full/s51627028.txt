The endotracheal tube ends 2.9 cm above the level of the carina. A right subclavian central venous catheter ends in the low SVC. An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm, ending in the mid stomach. A left-sided pacemaker/ICD and associated right atrial, right ventricular, and coronary sinus leads are unchanged in position. Lung volumes are low, slightly decreased compared to the prior study from ___. Bibasilar heterogeneous opacities, right greater than left, are not significantly changed compared to the prior radiograph from ___. Of note, the opacities at the right lung base were seen to demonstrate heterogeneous enhancement on the CT from ___, suggestive of either concomitant pneumonia or parenchymal contusion. There is pulmonary vascular congestion, without frank interstitial pulmonary edema. Band-like atelectasis is noted within the right mid lung, increased compared to the prior study. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. A displaced left mid clavicular fracture is redemonstrated. A known left eleventh rib fracture is better seen on the prior CT.
