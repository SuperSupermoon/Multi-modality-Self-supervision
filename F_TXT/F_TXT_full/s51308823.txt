In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and central catheter remain in place. Dobbhoff tube has been pushed forward so that the tip lies at least into the second portion of the duodenum where it crosses the lower margin of the image. The patient has taken a better inspiration. Given that fact, there is probably little change in the size of the cardiac silhouette and degree of pulmonary vascular congestion. The left hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, suggesting some improvement in the pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
