There are new regions of consolidation in the left lung, particularly over the left lung apex and left midlung. Linear streaky bibasilar opacities may be secondary to atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, atherosclerotic calcifications again noted at the aortic arch. Vertebroplasty changes are noted in the mid thoracic spine.
