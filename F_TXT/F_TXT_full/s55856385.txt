AP chest compared to ___ and ___: The left apical pleural tube is unchanged in position. The smaller catheter in the lower right hemithorax has been repositioned more superiorly to the level of the mid chest. Pleural effusion on the left has decreased appreciably since ___ but a small residual of effusion is difficult to distinguish from residual left pleural thickening. Lung volumes are quite low, on the left due substantially to basilar atelectasis, causing exaggeration of the caliber of both the heart, mediastinal vessels, and pulmonary vessels. Nevertheless, I am concerned about possible interstitial edema. Conventional radiographs should be obtained as soon as feasible. Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall is decreasing. No pneumothorax.
