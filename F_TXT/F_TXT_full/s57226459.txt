Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position. Cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged with a somewhat globular configuration. This could reflect either cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion. Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved. Moderate right pleural effusion persists, and may have a loculated component medially adjacent to the right heart border. Small left pleural effusion is also present as well as persistent bibasilar atelectasis and/or consolidation.
