Single portable view of the chest. Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam. Increased opacities at the lung bases, with lack of visualization of the diaphragms. This may be due to chronic process of the lung bases. The diaphragm is not well seen likely due to patient's lordotic positioning. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but likely unchanged given differences in positioning. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
