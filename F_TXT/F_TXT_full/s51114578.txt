The patient remains intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach. An aortic stent graft projects from the arch through the lower part of the descending thoracic aorta, as before. A single-lead pacemaker device also appears unchanged. An internal central jugular venous catheter has been slightly retracted, now terminating over the left mediastinal border, presumably in the left brachiocephalic vein. Somewhat increased confluent left basilar and infrahilar opacification with air bronchograms is nonspecific, but most often would represent a combination of atelectasis, perhaps pneumonia, and possibly with a pleural effusion. The central pulmonary vasculature appears moderately engorged including enlargement of the main pulmonary artery.
