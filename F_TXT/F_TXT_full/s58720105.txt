The right IJ catheter is again visualized. There is a kink, probably at the skin entrance. The heart is mildly enlarged. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution. There is bilateral lower lobe volume loss/small infiltrate. The overall impression is that of worsened fluid status. An underlying infectious process in the lower lobe cannot be excluded.
