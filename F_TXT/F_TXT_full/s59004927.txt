In comparison to ___ study there is diffuse pulmonary opacities seen, with progression in the right upper and right middle lobes as well as new opacities in upper lung. Again given the setting setting of hemoptysis pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded as well as pulmonary edema and aspiration. Given the rapidity of the progression pneumonia is less likely. Again seen is a right jugular central venous catheter which terminates in the right atrium. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable when compared to previous studies.
