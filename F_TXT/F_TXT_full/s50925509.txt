Endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the carina. The intra-aortic balloon pump has its tip approximately 4.4 cm below the top of the aortic knob. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Increasing retrocardiac consolidation likely reflects partial lower lobe atelectasis. There may be a small layering left effusion. No pulmonary edema.
