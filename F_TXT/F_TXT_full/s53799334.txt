In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes that accentuate the prominence of the cardiac silhouette. Some engorgement of pulmonary vessels could reflect the recent pregnancy rather than definite pulmonary edema. Some prominence in the azygos region and central vessels could be a manifestation of increased pulmonary venous pressure. There is increased opacification in the retrocardiac region with poor definition of the medial portion of the left hemidiaphragm. This probably represents atelectatic changes, though in the appropriate clinical setting aspiration could be considered.
