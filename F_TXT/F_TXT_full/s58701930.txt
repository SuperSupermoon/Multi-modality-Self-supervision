Subtle increased density adjacent to the cardiac apex, with obscuration of the lower left cardiac border, has been present on multiple prior studies, and is thus likely chronic. No corresponding abnormality was identified on the lateral view performed one day prior. There is no further parenchymal opacity identified. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or edema. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
