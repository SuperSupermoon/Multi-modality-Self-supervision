Interval extubation. Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and is accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion and minimal interstitial edema. Worsening bibasilar opacities probably represent atelectasis in the setting of recent extubation, but aspiration is an additional consideration. Small bilateral pleural effusions also appear slightly increased, but positional differences may contribute to this apparent change.
