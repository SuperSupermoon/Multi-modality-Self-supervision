The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 2.9 cm above the level of the carina. A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC, unchanged. An enteric catheter passes below the level of the diaphragm, ending in the upper stomach. The side-hole is positioned near the gastroesophageal junction, unchanged. There is a left-sided pacemaker with associated right atrial and right ventricular leads, as before. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Coarse reticular opacities throughout both lungs, right greater than left, were seen as far back as ___, suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis. Superimposed interstitial edema or areas of infection cannot be excluded given the diffuse background abnormality. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
