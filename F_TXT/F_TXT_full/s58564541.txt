Right pleural effusion has increased in size and is now moderate to large. Adjacent areas of parenchymal opacification in the mid and lower lung may reflect atelectasis and/or infectious pneumonia. Small to moderate left pleural effusion is similar in size, with adjacent left basilar opacity favoring atelectasis. There is apparent ascites and anasarca present.
