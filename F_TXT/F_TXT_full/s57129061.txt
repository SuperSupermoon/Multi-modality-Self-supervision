Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Left basal consolidation and pleural effusion appear to be slightly more pronounced than on the prior study, but on the other hand, the right perihilar opacity has improved; thus, finding most likely corresponding to the dependent changes related to positioning of the patient. No pneumothorax is seen. No appreciable pulmonary edema is demonstrated, but mild vascular engorgement is noted, again asymmetric.
