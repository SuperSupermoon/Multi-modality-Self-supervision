Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Cervical and thoracic spine hardware is again seen, similar in appearance. The superior vena cava stent/filter is again seen, similar in appearance as compared to the prior study, though partially obscured by the spinal hardware. No focal consolidation is seen. There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may be due to mild pleural thickening, although trace pleural effusion is not excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Anchor screws are noted overlying the left humeral head. No definite acute fracture is seen.
