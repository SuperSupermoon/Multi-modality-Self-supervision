The endotracheal tube is 5 cm above the carina with the neck in flexion. An enteric tube terminates in the stomach. Cervical hardware is partially imaged. Diffuse interstitial opacities throughout the lungs, predominating the perihilar region, are markedly worse from five hours prior. Heart is mildly enlarged, and there is prominence of the central venous vasculature. There is no definite pleural effusion; however, the left costophrenic angle was not imaged. Overall, the constellation of findings is most consistent with a moderate pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
