As compared to the previous radiograph, a portion of the left effusion was obviously aspirated. However, a small degree of effusion on the left persists. There is no convincing evidence for the presence of a left pneumothorax. Left lower lobe atelectasis is still visible. On the right, the pre-existing effusion has also decreased. No other relevant change. A nasogastric tube has been inserted in the interval.
