Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Left lower chest implanted neurostimulator is again seen and obscures the left costophrenic angle. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity could be due to atelectasis; however, underlying consolidation due to aspiration or infection not excluded. No large pleural effusion is seen but trace pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
