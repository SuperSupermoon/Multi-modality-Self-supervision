The patient is slightly rotated to her left which fortuitously allows for better visualization of the mediastinum. The silhouette of the right aspect of the mediastinum is unusual in configuration with pronounced bowing of the ascending aorta. There are no signs of acute hemorrhage. Otherwise, cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal in appearance. The lungs are clear and well expanded bilaterally, but no masses, lesions, pleural effusions or areas of focal consolidation concerning for infection. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
