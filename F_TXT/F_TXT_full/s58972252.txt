A single upright view of the chest demonstrates left chest tube projecting over medial left lung base. Moderate-to-large left pneumothorax seen on CT of the same date has nearly resolved. Subcutaneous gas in the left lateral chest is noted. Comminuted fractures of the left clavicle, scapula and nondisplaced fractures of the right ribs are better demonstrated on CT of the same date. Right lung is well expanded and is clear. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is normal. There is no pulmonary edema. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
