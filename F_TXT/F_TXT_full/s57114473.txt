Low lung volumes cause bibasilar atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding. Hazy opacification of the right lung base is similar to the recent prior study and consistent with the moderate pleural effusion seen on recent CTA chest. There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
