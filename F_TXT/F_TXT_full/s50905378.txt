Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for slight patient rotation. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new since the prior radiograph and accompanied by small bilateral pleural effusions. Minimal patchy bibasilar opacities probably represent patchy atelectasis, but aspiration and early infectious pneumonia are also possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
