Since the previous radiograph, the paracardiac opacity is not air-filled but unchanged in size and location. There might be a small right pleural effusion but no pneumothorax is seen. Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia of fibrosis. The clips in the perihilar right region are in constant position.
