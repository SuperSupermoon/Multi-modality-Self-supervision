In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 2.2 cm above the carina. It should be noted that there is a low position of the clavicle as the patient is flexed forward for this study. The nasogastric tube loops in the fundus of the stomach and then extends to the lower stomach below the lower margin of the image. Lungs are clear without vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
