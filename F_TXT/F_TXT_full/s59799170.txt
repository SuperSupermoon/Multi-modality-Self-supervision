The ET tube terminates approximately 4.4-cm above the carina. There is an enteric tube which traverses below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film. The heart size is normal in size. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Patchy opacities at the right right lung apex and obscuring the left cardiac border suggest minor atelectasis. Possible old healed rib fractures are seen along the left eighth and ninth ribs.
