Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contour is unchanged with similar enlargement of the hila compatible with known lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Right perihilar opacity is re- demonstrated, perhaps minimally improved in the interval, with minimal patchy left perihilar ill-defined nodular opacities also appearing unchanged. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Streaky atelectasis is noted in the left lung base. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
