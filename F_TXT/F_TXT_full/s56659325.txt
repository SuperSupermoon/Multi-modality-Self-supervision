AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. During the interval, the previously described Swan-Ganz catheter has been withdrawn and the corresponding right internal jugular sheath has been removed. One can, however, still identify a small caliber catheter enter from the same approach and terminate overlying the mediastinal structures 3 cm below the lower border of the clavicle. This indicates the upper third of the SVC. No pneumothorax is seen. Appearance of previously described endo-aortic graft is unchanged. No new pulmonary or parenchymal abnormalities are identified.
