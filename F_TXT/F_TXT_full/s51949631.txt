Study is slightly limited by patient rotation. Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged. While the mediastinal and hilar contours appear grossly unremarkable, the previous chest CT did demonstrate prevascular lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacity is seen within the right lung base corresponding to the area of infarction seen on the prior CT. Linear atelectasis seen within the left lung base. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
