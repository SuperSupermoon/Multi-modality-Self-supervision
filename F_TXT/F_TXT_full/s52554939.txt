ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carinal. Left internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged with some potential enlargement of the cardiac silhouette but there is interval progression of pulmonary edema, currently moderate with right basal atelectasis. No appreciable pleural effusion but small amount cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax.
