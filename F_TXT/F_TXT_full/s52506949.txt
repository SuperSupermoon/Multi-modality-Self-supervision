Since the most recent prior study, there is interval retraction of the right PICC line, whose tip now terminates in the proximal right atrium. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain stable with top normal heart size. Persistent obscuration of the right cardiac border is compatible with pneumonia. There is no new focal consolidation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
