An endotracheal tube is unchanged in position with the tip terminating just below the thoracic inlet. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications with predilection for the bilateral lung bases appears unchanged from the most recent prior study, likely a combination of large bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacification is unchanged. In the appropriate clinical context, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
