AP chest compared to ___: There is still a right PICC line in place ending in the mid SVC. Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are worse. There is probably no pulmonary edema, but there may be a small cluster of nodular opacities in the right mid lung lateral to the hilus which may indicate early infection. Conventional radiographs recommended when feasible.
