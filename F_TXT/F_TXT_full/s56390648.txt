Diffuse opacities through both lungs are noted, but may be accentuated by supine positionoing and low lung volumes, as there is no correposnding opacity in the upper portion of the lungs seen on the conteporaneous c-spine CT. Low inspiratory volumes may also account for slight prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The heart is not enlarged. No supine film evidence of pneumothorax identified and no gross effusion. No apical capping is identified. No rib fracture detected on this lung-technique film.
