No overt pulmonary edema is seen. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The aorta is somewhat tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Subtle nodular opacity projecting over the anterior right sixth rib may be artifactual but underlying pulmonary nodule not excluded. Recommend shallow oblique radiographs for further assessment.
