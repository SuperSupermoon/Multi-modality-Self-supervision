Since the prior study there has been new opacification of the right lung base, obscuring the right heart border and right hemidiaphragm. This is likely a function of consolidation in the right middle and lower lobes, as well moderate right pleural effusion. Additionally, there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No left-sided pleural effusion. Right chest wall port catheter terminates in the upper right atrium and a left-sided PICC line has been retracted since the prior study, not terminating in the mid SVC. Enteric tube is beyond the diaphragm. Partially imaged PTBD, common bile duct and duodenal stents are seen.
