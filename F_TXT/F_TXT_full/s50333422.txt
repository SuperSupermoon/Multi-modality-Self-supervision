Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. Right sided pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and right ventricle. Right pleural effusion is moderate. There is evidence of mild interstitial pulmonary edema with more conspicuous right mid and lower lobe opacity worrisome for superimposed infectious process. Left tracheal shift is noted and might be consistent either with tortuosity of the vessels or enlarged thyroid gland.
