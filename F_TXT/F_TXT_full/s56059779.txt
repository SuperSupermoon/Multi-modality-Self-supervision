In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is essentially within normal limits. There is some mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, which could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle could be a manifestation of small effusion or previous pleural thickening. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
