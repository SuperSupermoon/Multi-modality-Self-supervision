Rotated positioning. Tracheostomy tube again noted. There is diffuse interstitial can alveolar edema, with moderate to moderately large left and small right effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Compared to the film from one day earlier, the appearances are overall similar. The CHF findings may be very slightly worse and the left effusion is probably slightly larger.
