Vascular catheters are unchanged in appearance since the recent study of earlier the same date, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. A large rounded area of consolidation in the left mid lung appears slightly more dense than on the prior study, and is accompanied by worsening area of opacity in a left retrocardiac region. Observed findings may reflect a rapidly progressive pneumonia, but a neoplastic mass in the left mid lung is also possible. Previously reported mild pulmonary edema has slightly improved in the interval with residual minimal interstitial edema remaining.
