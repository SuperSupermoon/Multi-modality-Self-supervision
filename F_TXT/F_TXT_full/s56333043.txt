A single semi-supine frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. There is a new right internal jugular central venous catheter ending in the mid SVC. Evaluation of the right lung apex is suboptimal secondary to the patient's lordotic positioning, causing the medial aspect of the clavicle to project over the upper portion of the lung. A small right apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded. There is no left pneumothorax. The lungs are clear. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal.
