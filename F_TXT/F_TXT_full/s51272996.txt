Compared to chest radiographs from ___, pulmonary edema has significantly improved, now right greater than left and mild to moderate overall. Retrocardiac opacification and opacification in the right mid to lower lung have minimally improved and likely reflect atelectasis, though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded. Small right pleural effusion persist. Trace, if any, effusion on the left. No new focal consolidation. No pneumothorax. Mild central vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Cardiopulmonary support devices are in unchanged standard placement.
