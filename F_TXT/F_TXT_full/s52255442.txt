As compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, bilateral layering pleural effusions have apparently decreased in size, but positional differences may contribute to this apparent change. Lucency within the imaged portion of the abdomen suggests free intraperitoneal air, possibly due to recent placement of percutaneous gastrostomy tube now visualized in the upper abdomen.
