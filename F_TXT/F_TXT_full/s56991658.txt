As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously seen bilateral parenchymal opacities have substantially decreased in extent and severity. Although of the opacities are still clearly visualized, notably in the upper and perihilar lung zones, the radiographic followup documents a clear improvement. The nasogastric tube and the left hemodialysis catheter are in unchanged position. Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No larger pleural effusions.
