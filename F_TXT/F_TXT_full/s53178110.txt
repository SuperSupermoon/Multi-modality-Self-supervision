The heart is moderately enlarged. Allowing for AP portable technique, the mediastinal and hilar contours are probably within normal limits aside from noting mildly prominent central pulmonary vascularity as well as tortuosity of the descending aorta. Opacification of the left costophrenic sulcus may be seen with a pleural effusion. There are mildly prominent indistinct pulmonary vascularity suggesting mild vascular congestion.
