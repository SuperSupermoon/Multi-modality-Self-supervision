CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. Left-sided chest tube is present. Again seen is a small- to moderate-sized left apical pneumothorax, similar to the prior film, possibly very slightly smaller. Patchy retrocardiac opacity and blunting of the left costophrenic angle is unchanged. Some patchy opacity in the right paratracheal region and atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region are similar to prior. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but stable.
