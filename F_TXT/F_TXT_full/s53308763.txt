Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. A pericardial drain projects over the cardiac silhouette. There is a small amount of new pneumopericardium. Increased opacification of the retrocardiac space likely represents atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
