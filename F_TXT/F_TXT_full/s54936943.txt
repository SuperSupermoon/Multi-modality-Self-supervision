New ET tube has been placed with tip ending at 4.5 cm from carina. New NG tube has been placed, but tip is not visualized, likely in distal gastric cavity. Minimal improvement of left lung base ventilation is due to reduced atelectasis, but with persistent mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Right base opacification due to atelectasis and pleural effusion is stable.
