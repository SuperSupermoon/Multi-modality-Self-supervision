1. Left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the proximal SVC. There is a streaky linear opacity at the left base, which may represent an area of atelectasis or scarring, although an early infectious process could have this appearance and therefore followup imaging would be advised. The remaining lungs are grossly clear. Several catheters are seen overlying the upper abdomen. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large effusions.
