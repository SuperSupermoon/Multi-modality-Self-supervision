Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Lingular mass was better assessed on recent prior CT. There is an interval development of mild pulmonary edema. Interval development of increased right medial lung base opacity most likely relates to fluid overload with possible underlying atelectasis rather than infection given its short-term development. There is also increased opacity at the lateral left lung base, again may be due to atelectasis and/or related to fluid overload given short-term development. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No large pleural effusion seen. The mediastinum is stable.
