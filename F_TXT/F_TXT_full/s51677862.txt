In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung volumes. Patchy areas of increased opacification are seen bilaterally, consistent with the clinical diagnosis of multifocal pneumonia. Some element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure may well be present. Opacifications at the bases with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms are consistent with atelectasis and effusion. There is a right IJ catheter that appears to have its tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction. However, this is extremely difficult to see given the degree of scattered radiation related to the size of the patient. The tip of the left subclavian catheter is also difficult to visualize, though it cannot be definitely followed past the mid portion of the subclavian vein.
