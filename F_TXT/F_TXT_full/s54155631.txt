In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 4.3 cm above the carina. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been rim moved and replaced with a right IJ sheath. The right PICC line extends to the cavoatrial junction or possibly the upper portion of the right atrium. Again there are bilateral layering effusions, more prominent on the right, with underlying compressive atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax.
