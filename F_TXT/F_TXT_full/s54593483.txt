Mild progression of the pre-existing left perihilar parenchymal opacities. Massive progression of the right opacities, presenting mainly with an alveolar component as well as with enlargement of the pulmonary vessels and a mild increase in extent of the pre-existing bilateral pleural effusions. Overall, the findings are consistent with a combination of flash pulmonary edema and pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
