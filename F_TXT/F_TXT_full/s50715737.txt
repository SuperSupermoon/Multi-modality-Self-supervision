Endotracheal tube and bilateral internal jugular central lines are unchanged in position. Status post median sternotomy for valve replacement with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Slightly worsening diffuse bilateral parenchymal process, but more focally in the left upper lobe and at both bases. Although this may represent a worsening infectious process, this all could be related to progression of pulmonary and interstitial edema. Clinical correlation is recommended. No pneumothorax.
