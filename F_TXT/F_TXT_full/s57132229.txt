As compared to the previous radiograph, the known right basal parenchymal opacity, likely reflecting pneumonia, is unchanged in appearance. Also unchanged is the left pleural effusion and the left atelectasis. The size of the heart continues to be borderline, but no overt pulmonary edema is present. The endotracheal tube continues to be positioned low and could be pulled back by 1 to 2 cm. Nasogastric tube and right internal jugular vein catheter are in unchanged position.
