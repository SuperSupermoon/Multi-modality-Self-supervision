Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Bibasilar opacities larger on the left side are a combination of large pleural effusions and adjacent lung consolidations most likely atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable. There is mild vascular congestion. There is no evident pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard position. The tip is 5.6 cm above the carina. Right subclavian catheter tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC. Left PICC tip is in the upper-to-mid SVC.
