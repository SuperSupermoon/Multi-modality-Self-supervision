In comparison with the study of ___, what appears to be the tip of the right PICC line remains in the axillary region. The enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and vascular pedicle is similar or more prominent, though the pulmonary vascular congestion has substantially decreased. The right lung is essentially clear, though there is some poorly defined opacification in the left mid and lower lung zones. This could represent some residual vascular congestion, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
