There has been interval placement of a right basilar chest tube with marked interval decrease in size of the right pleural effusion, now with only a residual small right pleural effusion remaining. No pneumothorax is clearly identified. Layering moderate left-sided pleural effusion is unchanged with associated left basilar atelectasis. Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Right axillary vascular stent is re- demonstrated.
