The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There has been interval placement of a right chest central line whose distal tip projects over the lower SVC. The bilateral hila are normal. The left basilar opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged, consistent with a layering left pleural effusion as seen on prior exams. There are no new focal lung consolidations. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax.
