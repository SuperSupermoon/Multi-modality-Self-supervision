In comparison with the scout film from the CT dated ___, there has been a surgical procedure with a chest tube in place and a relatively small-to-moderate pneumothorax. Extensive opacification is seen in the mid and upper zone. This presumably represents some combination of post-surgical changes and atelectasis.
