Right-sided chest tube remains in place with a persistent small right apical pneumothorax and adjacent right apical cap. Airspace opacities in the right lung have slightly improved consistent with pulmonary contusion, and underlying areas of pulmonary laceration injury are again demonstrated in the right mid and lower lung regions. Multiple contiguous right-sided rib fractures are again demonstrated consistent with flail chest, and note is also made of fractures of the right clavicle and scapula as well as persistent subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall.
