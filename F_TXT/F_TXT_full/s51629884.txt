A single portable frontal upright view of the chest redemonstrates a moderate left pneumothorax, relatively unchanged in size compared to the prior study. A pigtail catheter through a left lateral approach terminates in the axilla. Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is again noted. Increased opacification at the left and right base are unchanged and likely reflect atelectasis.
