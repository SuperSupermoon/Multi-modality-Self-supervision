Single semiupright AP image of the chest. There are low lung volumes with bronchovascular crowding. Prominent interstitial markings are seen, left greater than right, which are increased from prior exam and are consistent with increased moderate pulmonary edema. The previously seen bibasilar opacities have decreased slightly from prior exam. These opacities likely represent atelectasis, but cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is very enlarged, similar to prior exams.
