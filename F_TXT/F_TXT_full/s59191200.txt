Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. There has been interval resolution of collapse of the right lower lobe. Remaining opacities in the right lower lobe and right middle lobes represent atelectasis and/or reexpansion edema. Left lower lobe atelectasis has improved. There is no pneumothorax. There are no other interval changes.
