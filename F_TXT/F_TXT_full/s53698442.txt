Comparison is made with prior study performed 6 hours earlier. Diffuse bilateral opacities have mildly improved consistent with improving moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. There are still interstitial and alveolar opacities diffusely distributed in the lungs, worse in the bases and sparing the central portion of the right upper lobe. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions. IMPRESSION Remaining opacities still could represent pulmonary edema or diffuse multilobar pneumonia. Continued followup is recommended.
