An ETT is present in standard position. A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter is present with tip in the right atrium. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is present. Opacity at the right lung base is likely accounted for by a combination of pleural effusion, atelectasis, although consolidation is also possible. Slight blunting at the left costophrenic angle is noted. There is no pneumothorax. Mild interstitial edema is likely present.
