Lung volumes are low. Heart size appears to be mildly enlarged, unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable. There is mild crowding of bronchovascular structures with slight upper zone vascular redistribution suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is demonstrated. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
