Compared to prior study, there is persistent moderate-to-large right-sided effusion with associated right base atelectasis. This in conjunction with low lung volumes makes determination of the cardiac silhouette difficult. Atherosclerotic mural calcifications are again noted within the aortic arch. There has been improvement in right greater than left asymmetric pulmonary edema with mild residual right-sided edema. A focal increased area of consolidation in the right upper lobe may also be due to asymmetric edema, however, remains suspicious for pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.
