Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlies the right pulmonary artery distally, possibly a right upper lobe branch, and lies more distal on the prior study. Clinical correlation regarding retraction of the Swan-Ganz catheter tip is requested. Again seen is the Dobbhoff type orogastric tube, which extends beneath the diaphragm off film. Surgical ___ are seen over the upper abdomen and midline. Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. Again seen is vascular plethora consistent with CHF, though this appears slightly improved. Also again seen is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Minimal atelectasis at the right base. Blunting of both costophrenic angles --___ possibility of small bilateral effusions cannot be excluded.
