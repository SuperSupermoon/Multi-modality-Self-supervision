In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube has been removed. There appears to be a small left apical pneumothorax, though overlying bony structures and catheters make this difficult to assess. Otherwise, bibasilar opacifications are again seen, consistent with effusions and atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
