Tracheostomy and right-sided PICC line are in adequate position. New right-sided hemodialysis catheter ends in the lower SVC. The lung volumes are lower and new bibasilar opacities, left more than right, is mainly explained by atelectasis. Superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are small, if any. Diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs which could be a mix of pulmonary edema and pneumonia are unchanged.
