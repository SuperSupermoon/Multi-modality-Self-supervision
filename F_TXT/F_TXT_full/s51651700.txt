AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The lungs remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms and areas of left base scarring suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema. The patient is rotated to the right. New since the prior study, there is right basilar opacity, raising concern for infection or aspiration. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. There is slight blunting of the costophrenic angles which may relate to the hyperinflated lungs and basilar scarring without definite pleural effusion seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
