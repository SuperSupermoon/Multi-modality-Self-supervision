There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is also seen. Bibasilar opacities may be due to combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis, but underlying consolidation is not excluded. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable. No pneumothorax is seen.
