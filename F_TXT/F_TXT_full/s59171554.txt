In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits. The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated. On the left, the hemidiaphragm is not well seen an there is increased opacification in the retrocardiac region, consistent with increasing volume loss in the left lower lobe and layering pleural effusion. Endotracheal tube is essentially unchanged with the tip approximately 5 cm above the carina.
