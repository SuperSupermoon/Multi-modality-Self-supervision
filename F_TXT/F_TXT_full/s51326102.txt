The left subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the mid to low SVC. The ET and nasogastric tubes are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The right basilar airspace opacity is more asymmetric today, and in the appropriate clinical context, infection or aspiration would be difficult to exclude. A small right pleural effusion with bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis is unchanged.
