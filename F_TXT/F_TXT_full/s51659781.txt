In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 5 cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid to lower SVC. Enteric tube is in place, though it can only be followed to the upper stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the image. There are dense streaks of atelectasis at the bases with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms consistent with small bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, though there is only relatively mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.
