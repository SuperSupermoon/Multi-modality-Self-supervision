The patient is rotated. The repositioned right IJ approach Swan-Ganz catheter tip now ends in the right pulmonary artery with its tip projecting over the right most aspect of the mediastinal silhouette, and could be pulled back about 2 cm. The right dialysis catheter remains unchanged position with its tip ending in the right atrium. No pneumothorax. Lung volumes remain low. Slight increase dopacity in the left hemithorax may be in part secondary to rotation and redistribution of overall unchanged moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions persist. The heart remains moderately to severely enlarged. The pulmonary arteries are enlarged, suggesting chronic pulmonary hypertension.
