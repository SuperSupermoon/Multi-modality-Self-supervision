A density projecting over the cervical spine and the lower neck is compatible with recent anterior cervical spine fusion hardware. The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased. There is retrocardiac opacification of the left lung base predominantly which may reflect atelectasis or consolidation. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is accentuated due to low lung volumes but is likely related in part to technique.
