AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The heart size is normal. Within the limitations of this portable radiograph, no evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy is present. The lungs are well inflated. Left basal opacity is noted, potentially representing atelectasis, but infectious process cannot be excluded. Line projecting over the left hemithorax most likely represents VP shunt, please correlate clinically.
