In comparison with study of ___, all of the monitoring and support devices have been removed except for the chest tubes. No evidence of pneumothorax. There are substantially lower lung volumes with opacification at the left base consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe as well as pleural effusion. Atelectatic changes are seen at the right base with possible small effusion. Overlying monitoring devices greatly obscure detail.
