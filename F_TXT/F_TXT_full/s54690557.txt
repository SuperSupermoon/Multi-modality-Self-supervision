An endotracheal tube terminates about 3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its tip below the imaged region of the epigastrium. The heart appears mildly enlarged. The lung volumes are low. Opacity at the left lung base suggests minor atelectasis, probably in the lingula. Pleural effusions are difficult to exclude but not explicitly shown. There is no pneumothorax.
