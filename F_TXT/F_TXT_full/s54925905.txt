Left IJ catheter terminates in the lower SVC. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but further assessment is limited by adjacent pleuropulmonary pathology. Increased, moderate right pleural effusion. Unchanged, moderate, subpulmonic left pleural effusion with poor aeration of the left lower lobe that most likely reflects atelectasis; however, pneumonia is also possible. No appreciable pneumothorax.
