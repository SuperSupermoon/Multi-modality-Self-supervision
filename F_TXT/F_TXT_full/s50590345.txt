A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right chest port with the catheter tip in the upper right atrium, unchanged in position. Heart size remains a top-normal, likely unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusions are persisting, increased on the right and similar on the left, with associated atelectasis. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.
