AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Comparing the frontal views indicates some improvement of the previously described bilateral basal plate atelectasis. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm persists and is related to a gas-distended left-sided colon loop. No new parenchymal infiltrates can be identified and the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. Lack of lateral view on today's examination cannot confirm integrity of posterior lower lobe areas and pleural sinuses as was accomplished on previous examination which included lateral view.
