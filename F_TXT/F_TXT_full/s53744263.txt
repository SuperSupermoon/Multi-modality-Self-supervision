Compared with 1 day earlier, there is possible subtle improvement in the right base and left mid zone opacities. Otherwise I doubt significant interval change. ET tube, NG tube and right subclavian central line are similar in configuration. No pneumothorax is detected. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is possibly minimally improved, as are inspiratory volumes. Retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation persist. Diffuse infiltrates in both lungs remain present, slightly improved as described above. No gross effusions identified, though small effusions might not be apparent.
