In this patient with a large hiatal hernia, the NG tube is seen coiled in the left upper abdomen though its tip extends superiorly into the intrathoracic portion of the stomach. Basilar atelectasis and tiny effusions are better assessed on outside hospital CT from earlier today. The upper lungs remain well aerated. Heart size cannot be assessed. Bony structures are intact with degenerative changes at the right AC joint. Free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
