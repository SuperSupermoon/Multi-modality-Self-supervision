Chest radiographs ___ through ___:12. Volume and distribution of extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall, right greater than left, both sides of the neck, and pneumomediastinum, is unchanged. There is no appreciable pneumothorax. Consolidation at the base of the right lung has not improved, less severe consolidation in the left lower lung has decreased. Findings suggest aspiration atelectasis though as suggested previously this could be dependent edema since the patient has very severe upper lobe emphysema. Small right pleural effusion persists. Right basal pleural pigtail drainage catheter is still in place. Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles no less than 8 cm from the carina an should be advanced several cm for more secure positioning. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
