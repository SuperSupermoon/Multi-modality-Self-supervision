Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm which may be due to left lower lobe atelectasis and volume loss or could also represent a retrocardiac consolidation. The right lung is grossly clear. The previously seen dialysis catheter is unchanged in position, terminating in the right atrium. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
