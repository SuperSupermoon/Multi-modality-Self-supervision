A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction. An esophageal stent projects over the lower part of the mediastinum. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. There is no evidence for mediastinal air. The lungs appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax, although exclusion of the extreme left costophrenic sulcus is noted. Streaky medial right basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis.
