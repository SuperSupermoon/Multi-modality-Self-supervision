Compared to the prior film, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed. Left IJ central line is unchanged, with tip over mid SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Probable background COPD. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged, with mild cardiomegaly. Mild vascular plethora is probably slightly improved. Hazy opacities at the right and left lung bases are themselves improved, but the right hemidiaphragm is less distinct, question due to differences in positioning. Faint hazy opacities at right-greater-than-left lung apices again noted. Small bilateral effusions would be difficult to exclude.
