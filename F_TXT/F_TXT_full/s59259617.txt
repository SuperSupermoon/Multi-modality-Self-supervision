Comparison is made to previous study from ___. The spinal hardware is again identified. There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is low, 1.8 cm above the carina. This could be pulled back an additional 2-3 cm for more optimal placement. There is a left-sided central venous catheter with the distal lead tip in the mid SVC perpendicular to SVC wall, unchanged. There is a nasogastric tube whose side port is below the gastroesophageal junction. There is an area of consolidation at the right base which is more apparent than on the prior study. There is sclerosis of the left humeral shaft with some central lucency. If there is pain in the shoulder, then would recommend dedicated left shoulder radiographs.
