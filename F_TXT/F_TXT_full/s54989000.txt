There is a large layering right pleural effusion and much smaller left effusion. There is increasing consolidation within the right lung and to a much lesser extent in the left lung. The perihilar and pulmonary vessels appear indistinct. Findings together would favor asymmetric moderate pulmonary edema, although an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. Calcifications are noted at the aortic arch. The heart remains enlarged. A dual lead pacemaker is seen with leads terminating over patient of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. No pneumothorax.
