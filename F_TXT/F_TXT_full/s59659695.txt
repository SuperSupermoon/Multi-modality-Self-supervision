Frontal supine view of the chest was obtained. The heart is of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours. The right hemithorax demontrates increased opacity, compatible with a moderate-to-large size layering pleural effusion. A small left pleural effusion is also present. No pneumothorax is seen. A right PICC line terminates in the axilla. Endotracheal tube terminates 1.8 cm above the carina. A Dobbhoff feeding tube and a gastric tube terminate below the diaphragm. The sidehole of the gastric tube is positioned in the distal esophagus.
