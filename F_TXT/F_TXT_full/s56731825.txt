Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. The heart is markedly enlarged. There are bilateral pleural effusions, appearing similar to the prior on the left, though diminished on the right with right effusion appearing loculated. The possibility of a left lower lobe pneumonia is impossible to exclude given the opacification and presumed left lower lobe atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Upper lungs appear well aerated. Bony structures appear stable.
