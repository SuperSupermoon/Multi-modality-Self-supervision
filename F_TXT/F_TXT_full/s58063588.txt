In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there are lower lung volumes with extensive opacification within the left hemithorax. This could well represent the hemothorax considered clinically. There also is volume loss in the left lung. Monitoring and support devices remain in place and the right lung is essentially clear. There is increased widening of the mediastinum with indistinct margins. This could be a manifestation of mediastinal bleeding.
