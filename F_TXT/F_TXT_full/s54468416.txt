Comparison to ___. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. The pre-existing pulmonary edema has not substantially changed. However, new parenchymal opacities have appeared in the upper left perihilar regions and in the right upper lobe as well as at the right lung basis. These changes are new or progressive since the previous examination and highly suggestive of pneumonia. New blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, likely caused by a small left pleural effusion. Unchanged position of the left Port-A-Cath.
