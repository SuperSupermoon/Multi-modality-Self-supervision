AP chest compared to 8:46 a.m.: ET tube has been advanced, now in standard placement. Poor definition of the right main bronchus suggests retained secretions or aspiration, accounting for persistent complete collapse of the right lung. Any right pleural effusion is incidental to the lung collapse. Small right pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall are stable, apical pleural tube in place. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right internal jugular line ends low in the SVC. Mild pulmonary edema persists in the left lung as does mild relative cardiac enlargement. Findings were discussed with the clinical care team over the telephone by Dr. ___ prior to this dictation.
