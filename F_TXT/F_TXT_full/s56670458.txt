Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Lungs are clear except for minimal bibasilar opacities which favor atelectasis over infectious pneumonia. If clinical suspicion for infection persists, followup PA and lateral radiographs within the department may be helpful for more complete assessment of the lung bases.
