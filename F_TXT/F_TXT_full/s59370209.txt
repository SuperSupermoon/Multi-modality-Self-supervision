1. Right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There continues to be bilateral diffuse airspace process with more focal consolidative appearance in the right lower lobe. Although this could represent severe pulmonary edema, multifocal pneumonia would be of concern given the areas of focality in the right lower lung. When compared to the most recent comparison study from ___, there is no significant interval change, although clearly the airspace process has progressed since ___. No large effusions. No pneumothorax. Lucency overlying the left neck soft tissues and extending into the left superior mediastinum is felt to represent air within the esophagus given patient rotation on the current examination.
