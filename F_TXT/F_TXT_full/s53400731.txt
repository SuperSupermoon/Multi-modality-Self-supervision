Interval placement of a tracheostomy tube, with tip terminating at approximately the thoracic inlet level. The tip appears asymmetrically positioned, abutting the left lateral wall of the trachea, but note is made of rotation of the patient chin and neck, which might influent the apparent position on radiographs. With this in mind, repeat non-rotated radiograph is suggested. There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by worsening interstitial edema, as well as a more patchy and linear area of opacity in the right mid lung region, most likely due to atelectasis.
