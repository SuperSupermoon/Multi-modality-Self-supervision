Two new right chest tubes have been placed both of them ending near the right lung apex. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Subcutaneous emphysema along the right lateral chest wall and right supraclavicular regions are persisting, however, minimally decreased. Small right-sided pleural effusion and right lower lung atelectasis is unchanged. Small linear band-like opacity in the left mid lung suggestive of atelectasis is new. Top normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
