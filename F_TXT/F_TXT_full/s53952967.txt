Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, a left-sided chest tube is been removed, with development of a very small left apical pneumothorax. Midline drains have also been removed and note is made of a questionable tiny right apical pneumothorax. Exam is otherwise remarkable for improving atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region.
