Single AP portable view of the chest demonstrates right basilar opacity consistent with a combination of atelectasis and moderate to large effusion. Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. Small left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis is present. Cardiac size is difficult to evaluate but is appears to remain enlarged, partly attributable to a moderate to large pericardial effusion. No pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary edema is present.
