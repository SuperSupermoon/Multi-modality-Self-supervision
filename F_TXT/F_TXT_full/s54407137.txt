Heart size is not well evaluated given right hemi thorax opacification. Thoracic aorta is mildly unfolded. Central pulmonary vascular congestion with interstitial edema. Opacification of nearly the entirety of the right hemi thorax corresponds to a combination of paraspinal mass, probable atelectasis and right effusion. Left base atelectasis and left effusion is small. No pneumothorax.
