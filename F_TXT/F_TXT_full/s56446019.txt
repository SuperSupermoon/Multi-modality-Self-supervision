Supine portable view of the chest, rotated to the patient's right shows clear but hyperexpanded lungs and mild cardiomegaly. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The right hilus is too large and too radiodense and there may be right hilar adenopathy. Descending aorta appears slightly tortuous. Partial imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
