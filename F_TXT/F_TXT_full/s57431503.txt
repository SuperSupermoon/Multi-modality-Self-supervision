There has been interval placement of a midline tracheostomy tube. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. In the right infrahilar region, there is a 2.3 x 2.3 cm rounded opacity which while could relate to vascular structures, an underlying nodule is not excluded, and further evaluation is recommended with chest CT. No focal consolidation is seen. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
