Compared to chest radiographs most recently ___. Lung volumes are generally lower, heart size is greater, and pulmonary vasculature more engorged following left thoracotomy, reflecting mild cardiac decompensation or volume overload. Greater opacification at the base of the left lung, is presumably atelectasis or pleural effusion. There is no appreciable pneumothorax, with an apical pleural drainage tube in place but there is new subcutaneous emphysema along the left chest wall.
