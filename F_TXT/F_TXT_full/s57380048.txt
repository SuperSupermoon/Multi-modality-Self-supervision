As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Bilateral basal parenchymal opacities. Small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly more extensive on the left than on the right. At the right lung bases, in the region of the known displaced rib fractures, there are subtle parenchymal opacities that might represent areas of lung contusion. Minimal fluid overload. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged position and course of the PICC line.
