Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There are diffuse multifocal lung opacities that have increased in the left lower lobe. These are consistent with pneumonia. There is mild vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC.
