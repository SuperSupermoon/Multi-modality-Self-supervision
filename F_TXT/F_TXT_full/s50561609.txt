Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube is noted which is coursing below the diaphragms, off the inferior borders of the film. There are low lung volumes. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Apparent widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to supine technique and low lung volumes. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, with a possible element of mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
