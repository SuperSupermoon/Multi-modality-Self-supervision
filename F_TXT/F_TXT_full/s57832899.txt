The patient remains intubated, the endotracheal tube terminating about 3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube passes into the stomach, its distal course not visualized. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the uppermost part of the atrium. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Overall, aeration appears somewhat better in each lung, but there is still widespread heterogeneous bilateral parenchymal opacification. Pleural effusions are difficult to exclude, but not demonstrated definitively. There is no pneumothorax.
