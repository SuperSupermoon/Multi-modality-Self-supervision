As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is redemonstration of a small left pleural effusion with atelectasis of the left lung base. There is increased opacity at the right lung base, which may reflect a combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid. However an early infectious process cannot be excluded. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is no pneumothorax. Surgical clips are noted at the right upper quadrant and a vascular stent projects over the left brachiocephalic vein. A right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
