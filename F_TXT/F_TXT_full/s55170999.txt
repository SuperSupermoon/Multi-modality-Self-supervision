AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Moderate right pleural effusion is larger. It obscures large scale consolidation at the right lung base which presumably has not cleared. Left lung is low in volume, with some basal atelectasis and vascular engorgement but no edema. There is no evidence of left pleural effusion. Rightward rotation makes it difficult to assess whether the mediastinum is midline. If it has shifted to the right, then much of the right basal opacification would be due to atelectasis. Right subclavian or PIC line ends in the upper to mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
