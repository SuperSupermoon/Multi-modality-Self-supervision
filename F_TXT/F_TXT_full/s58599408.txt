As compared to the previous image, no relevant change is seen. The monitoring and support devices continue to be in correct position. The pleural effusion and parenchymal opacities as well as the pleural lesions on the right are constant. A minimal hyperlucency at the level of the costophrenic angle on the right could suggest the minimal remnant air inclusion in the pleural space. Unchanged appearance of the heart and of the left lung.
