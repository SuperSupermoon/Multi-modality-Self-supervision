Interval placement of a left thoracostomy drain with tip in the left lung base. No radiographically evident pneumothorax is visualized on this supine radiograph. Known manubrial and rib fractures are poorly visualized. Retrocardiac opacity may be due to residual pleural effusion/hemothorax and adjacent atelectasis. Cardiomegaly, as before. There is a left chest pacemaker with electrodes in expected positions. Aorta is calcified, indicating atherosclerosis. There asymmetric fullness of the right neck, compared to the left, consistent with known hematoma. Again seen are changes compatible with Paget's disease in the right humerus.
