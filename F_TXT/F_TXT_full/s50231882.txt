As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. The size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased. Both lung bases, areas of atelectasis are seen, left more than right. The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. However, there is no overt pulmonary edema and no evidence of pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
