As compared to the previous radiograph, there is status post bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient shows complete opacification of the left hemithorax, likely caused by a combination of effusion and atelectasis, given the lack of substantial mediastinal displacement. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base. Mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. Unchanged course of the left internal jugular vein catheter.
