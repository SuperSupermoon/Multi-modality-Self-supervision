Endotracheal tube terminates 4.7 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of view. There are low lung volumes. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The superior mediastinum is prominent, which may be due to combination of low lung volumes and AP, supine portable technique. However, if there is clinical concern for acute mediastinal process, consider chest CT for further assessment. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged, likely artifactually accentuated. No displaced fracture is seen.
