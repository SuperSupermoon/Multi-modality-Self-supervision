Compared to the preoperative radiographs obtained 1 week prior, lung volumes are low, particularly on the right. Clips projecting over the right hilum are new. Adjacent hilar opacity is likely postsurgical. A right chest tube is unremarkably positioned. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral chest wall and inferior right neck is new. Low lung volumes accentuate a normal sized heart.
