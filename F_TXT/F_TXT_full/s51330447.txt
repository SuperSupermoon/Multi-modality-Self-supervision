Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a left-sided PleurX catheter. There has been interval decrease in left-sided pleural effusion. In the apex and lateral left chest wall, there are areas of increased lucency, which may represent a pneumothorax versus expanded lung. Stable-appearing interstitial abnormality in the right lung may represent pulmonary edema versus dissemination of tumor. Again seen is a discrete metastatic mass in the right upper lobe.
