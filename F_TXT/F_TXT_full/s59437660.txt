Single frontal image of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which are likely secondary to poor inspiration. There has been interval increase in the left lower lobe opacity. The increase in opacity of the right perihilar region likely represents vascular crowding secondary to low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly more obscured by the increasing left opacity but appears to be unchanged from prior exam. The right central line, defibrillator devices, and NG tube appear to be in unchanged positions.
