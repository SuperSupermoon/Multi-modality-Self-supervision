Numerous bilateral mediastinal and hilar calcified lymph nodes are again seen without significant interval change. Biapical scarring with upward retraction of the hila is unchanged. The lungs remain hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms. Since the prior study, there has been increased blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to a small pleural effusion. Left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis in underlying consolidation is not excluded. A trace right pleural effusion be difficult to exclude. The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged. Calcified breast implants are seen overlying the lower thorax bilaterally. Partially imaged is a right humeral prosthesis.
