The patient is status post sternotomy. The aorta is mildly tortuous and calcified. The heart is normal in size. Hazy central opacities suggest mild vascular congestion. There is borderline elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, compared to the left; overall lung volumes are also low. There is no definite pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. Degenerative changes are severe along the right shoulder including apparently complete effacement of the acromiohumeral interval with pseudloarticulation suggesting rotator cuff pathology and superimposed degenerative change. The bones appear demineralized.
