Heart size is borderline enlarged. The aorta remains tortuous and diffusely calcified. The hilar contours are stable. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is likely attributable to low lung volumes. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are more pronounced on the left rather than right, and may be slightly improved compared to the prior study. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated, and there are no displaced fractures noted.
