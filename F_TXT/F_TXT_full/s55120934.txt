In comparison with the study of ___, the area of increased opacification in the right upper lobe, marginated inferiorly by the minor fissure, is again consistent with right upper lobe pneumonia. The right base appears clearer than on the previous study and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion at this time. Cardiac silhouette and aortic graft are unchanged.
