There is marked rightward rotation of the patient on the current radiograph, which severely limits assessment. Median sternotomy wires are again seen. A tracheostomy tube appears in grossly appropriate location. A left IJ central venous catheter has a similar orientation in comparison to prior radiograph, however due to rotation, position is unable to be accurately determined. There is stable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouettes. Diffuse interstitial prominence is similar in appearance to prior studies. Blunting of the right lateral CP angle may represent a trace right pleural effusion. There is no obvious left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
