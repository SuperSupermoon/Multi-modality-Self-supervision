A tracheostomy tube is in position. A right-sided PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava. There is a pigtail catheter projecting over the right hemithorax. There has been marked improvement in aeration of both lungs but with persistent opacification of the right lower lung suggesting residual atelectasis. Confluent retrocardiac opacification is not specific but is also most often seen with atelectasis. It is difficult to exclude pleural effusions.
