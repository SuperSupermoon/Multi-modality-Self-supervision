Lung volumes are lower than on prior exam and there are uniformly distributed bilateral reticular opacities, suggestive of possible pulmonary fibrotic changes although cannot exclude a superimposed interstitial pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities are seen, which may represent atelectasis but cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting. There is a new left retrocardiac opacity. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged.
