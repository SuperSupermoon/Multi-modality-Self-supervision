In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been removed. No definite pneumothorax is appreciated. There is suggestion of a curvilinear line in the right apex, though all normal vessels appear to extend beyond this. Extensive subcutaneous gas is again seen bilaterally, although it appears less prominent than on the previous study. Some increased opacification is seen at the right base. This could reflect postoperative changes. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
