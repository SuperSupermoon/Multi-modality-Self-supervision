As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone the right thoracocentesis. The right pleural effusion has substantially decreased in extent. It is now limited to a small aspect of the right costophrenic sinus. On the left, the effusion is unchanged. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Sternal wires, valvular replacement and right PICC line are constant.
