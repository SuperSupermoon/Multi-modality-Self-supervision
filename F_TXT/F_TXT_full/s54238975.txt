AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. A right-sided PICC line has now been placed and is seen to terminate overlying the mediastinal structures on the right side compatible with a location in the mid portion of the SVC some 2 cm below the level of the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. A plate atelectasis on the right lung base is seen but no other pulmonary abnormalities can be observed. Remarkable is the marked improvement of a previously identified marked pulmonary vascular congestion and edema pattern on the next preceding portable examination of ___. The rapid improvement suggests successful treatment of the pulmonary edema pattern. The heart size is difficult to determine as the diaphragms are in relatively high position obscuring the heart shadow. Improvement. Proper position of right-sided PICC line. Marked improvement of previously identified pulmonary edema.
