Portable chest radiograph demonstrates endotracheal tube with tip at the level of the clavicles, approximately 4.7 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen with tip in stomach and sideport at or slightly beyond the level of the GE junction. Could be advanced several centimeters to move sideport beyond GE junction. Heart, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Bibasilar opacifications likely reflect atelectasis, though cannot exclude infectious process. Left costophrenic angle blunting may represent a trace pleural effusion vs atelectasis.
