Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. After thoracocentesis there has been substantial decrease in the left pleural effusion. No definitive evidence of pneumothorax is present. Still at the left lung base there is small amount of fluid in combination with re-expansion edema/atelectasis seen. Right basal opacities are unchanged.
