A calcified thyroid nodule is noted to the left of the trachea. A right sided PICC terminates in the distal SVC. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. The previously seen right basal airspace opacity has now resolved. There is persistence of the left basal airspace opacity, this may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema or infection. No pneumothorax seen. No definite pleural effusion.
