Apparent interval repositioning of left PICC, now terminating in a midline position in the left brachiocephalic vein. Unchanged appearance of cardiomediastinal contours and enlargement of the central pulmonary vasculature. Worsening left retrocardiac opacity which may be due to atelectasis or infectious consolidation, accompanied by a small left pleural effusion. Patchy opacity at right lung base is also slightly worsened, and there is a probable small right pleural effusion present. No detectable pneumothorax.
