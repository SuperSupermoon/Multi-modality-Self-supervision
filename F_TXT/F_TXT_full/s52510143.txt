Lungs are clear, heart size normal. There is no pleural abnormality. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Left PIC line ends low in the SVC. An increase in the bulge at the medial aspect of the left diaphragmatic contour could be due to lower lung volume, or may reflect an increase in the size of the spleen which occupies an unusual supra renal position in this patient. Clinical correlation advised.
