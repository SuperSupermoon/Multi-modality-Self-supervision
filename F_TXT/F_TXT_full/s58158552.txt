ET tube and right IJ central line are in adequate position. The NG tube terminates with the side port at the level of the GE junction. The tube could be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal positioning. The lungs are well expanded. Peribronchial opacification is seen in the right lower lung extending to the chest wall, concerning for aspiration. There is left lower lobe collapse, which could also possibly be due to aspiration. Diffuse hazy opacity at the left lung base suggests a left pleural effusion. There is no effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
