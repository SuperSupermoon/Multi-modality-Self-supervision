The endotracheal tube is in good position. The right subclavian and jugular line are also well placed. There is a catheter that projects at the left hilar region. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. Moderate left pleural effusion that is difficult to compare with the exam done yesterday because of different technique and position. Mild right pleural effusion, unchanged. Band of atelectasis on the right side, unchanged. No pneumothorax.
