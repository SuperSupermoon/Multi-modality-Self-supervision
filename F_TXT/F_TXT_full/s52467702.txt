Again seen is cardiomegaly, with a left-sided single lead pacemaker, not significantly changed. Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora is also again seen. There is as before, there is, increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Compared with ___, however, there has been some interval obscuration of left hemidiaphragm and of the left costophrenic angle suggesting interval progression of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. A small left effusion cannot be entirely excluded. Minimal patchy opacity at the right lung base, possibly atelectasis, is not significantly changed. No gross right effusion.
