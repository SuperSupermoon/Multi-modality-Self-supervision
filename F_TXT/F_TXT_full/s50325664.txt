Tracheostomy tube again noted. NG tube again noted, extending beneath the diaphragm to overlie the stomach. Right subclavian PICC line tip lies near the SVC/ RA junction, similar to prior. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Equivocal minimal upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. Patchy opacity at the left lung base again noted. However, there has been interval improvement, with the left hemidiaphragm now visible. Small left pleural effusion difficult to exclude, but this appears improved. Equivocal minimal right pleural effusion. The right lung remains grossly clear.
