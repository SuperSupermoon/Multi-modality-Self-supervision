Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the bilateral diffuse airspace and interstitial process which appears to have slightly worsened likely reflecting worsening pulmonary edema, although a worsening pneumonia should also be considered. There are likely layering effusions. No pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. A gastrostomy tube is in place. Residual contrast is seen within non-distended transverse colon.
