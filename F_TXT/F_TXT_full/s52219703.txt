Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size is top normal. Aorta is tortuous in particular ascending aorta. Lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Given the prominence of ascending aorta, further assessment with cross-sectional imaging for assessment of the ascending aorta diameter might be considered on a nonemergency basis to the possibility of aortic artery aneurysm.
