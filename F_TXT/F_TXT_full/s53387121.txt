The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. There is a moderate pleural effusion on the right, potentially with a degree of loculation. Other than increased pleural effusion, however, there is no definitive change, noting otherwise similar patchy opacification of the right lung, particularly the right lower lung. The left lung remains essentially clear. There is no clear evidence for pleural effusion on the left. There is no pneumothorax.
