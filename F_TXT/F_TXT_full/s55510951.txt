Persistent cardiomegaly and marked pulmonary artery enlargement, the latter suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Patchy opacities have developed at both lung bases and possibly also in the right upper lobe, although the latter is partially obscured by superimposed structures including the medial right clavicle and ribs. Considering history of recent stroke, multifocal aspiration/aspiration pneumonia should be considered, and short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
