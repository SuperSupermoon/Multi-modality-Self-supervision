Lung volumes are low, and there is moderate cardiomegaly, with indistinct pulmonary vasculature, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. The left-sided pacemaker leads project in the right atrium and right ventricle. A left pleural effusion is moderate, with overlying patchy opacity, potentially atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. Streaky right basilar atelectasis is mild with associated small right pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax. A vascular stent projects over the left upper lung. The aorta is extensively calcified.
