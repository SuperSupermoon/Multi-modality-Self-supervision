Lung is well inflated with increased opacification of the right lower lobe, which is likely atelectasis. In appropriate clinical setting, a superimposed pneumonia should be considered. Left lung is clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart is still mildly enlarged. No evidence of rib fractures.
