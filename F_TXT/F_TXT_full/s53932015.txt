Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a left-sided pacemaker with intact dual leads. The median sternotomy wires are seen. There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 3.1 cm above the carina. There are again seen airspace opacities bilaterally. There is likely an element of underlying pulmonary fibrosis. This appears stable. No pneumothoraces are seen. There are no large pleural effusions.
