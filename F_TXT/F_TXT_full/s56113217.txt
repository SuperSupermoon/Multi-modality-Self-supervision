In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2.7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is coiled on the hypopharynx. Left chest tube is in place with no evidence of pneumothorax. Continued low lung volumes with increased opacification at the left base consistent with some combination of pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. There is probably some element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
