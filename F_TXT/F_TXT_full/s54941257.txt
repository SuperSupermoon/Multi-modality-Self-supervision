A right IJ catheter is seen with tip terminating over the lower SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Relatively low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, likely due to atelectasis in this setting of low lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, likely due to poor inspiratory effort with possible superimposed mild cardiomegaly. Elevation the left hemidiaphragm is seen. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are again noted at the aortic arch.
