Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, a nasogastric tube has been replaced or repositioned, now terminating within the stomach. There remains dense opacification in the left retrocardiac region likely due to a combination of the patient's known aneurysmal dilation of the descending thoracic aorta with adjacent atelectasis and effusion. Right basilar atelectasis is slightly improved in the interval and a small right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size as well. No other relevant changes.
