The nasogastric tube extends to the mid to lower body of the stomach, with the side port just distal to the esophagogastric junction. Left subclavian catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2.8 cm above the carina. No evidence of cardiomegaly, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. Suggestion of some increased opacification at the left base medially, which could represent atelectatic changes.
