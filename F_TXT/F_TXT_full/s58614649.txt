Since the prior exam, a new left internal jugular central venous catheter has been placed with the tip in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Bibasilar opacities are not significantly changed. There is no new opacity, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. A catheter projecting over the heart and right upper abdomen is of uncertain etiology, and may be outside the patient.
