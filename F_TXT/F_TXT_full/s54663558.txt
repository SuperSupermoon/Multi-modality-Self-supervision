There continues to be a large layering right effusion with associated patchy airspace disease in the right mid and lower lung most likely reflecting atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded. The heart remains markedly enlarged favoring cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. The left lung is grossly clear. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema.
