Right internal jugular venous catheter is in unchanged position with the tip terminating in the distal SVC. A left-sided dialysis catheter is again seen with the tip terminating in the right atrium. Heart size is normal. Stable, abnormal contour of the left mediastinum could represent a mediastinal mass. Recommend chest CT for further evaluation. Slight interval increase in right basilar opacity without associated volume loss likely reflects consolidation. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
