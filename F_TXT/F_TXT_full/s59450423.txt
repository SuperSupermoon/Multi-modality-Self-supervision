Left mid and lower lung field airspace opacities appear almost entirely resolved with a mild residual left lower lobe opacity. The ET tube ends 4.5 cm from the carina, the left subclavian line ends in the right atrium, and the enteric tube lies within the stomach. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
