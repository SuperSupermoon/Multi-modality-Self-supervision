1. Interval removal of a right internal jugular central line with placement of a large-bore hemodialysis catheter which has its tip in the mid-to-lower superior vena cava. Endotracheal tube has its tip at thoracic inlet, unchanged. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Lung volumes remain low with patchy bilateral opacities which could reflect pulmonary edema, bilateral pneumonia, or ARDS. Clinical correlation is advised. The heart remains enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded. No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity for detecting pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
