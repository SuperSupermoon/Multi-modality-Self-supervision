In comparison with the study of ___, there is possibly some mild decrease in the area of increased opacification in the mid portion of the right lung and lower zone. Small area of lucency in the right hilar region could conceivably represent cavitation, though this could also merely be superimposed interstitial and vascular markings. Blunting of the costophrenic angle persists with a right pigtail catheter in place. There is suggestion of a lenticular area of pneumothorax laterally just adjacent to the mid lung opacification. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. This information has been conveyed to Dr. ___, ___ for Dr. ___, by telephone on ___ at 9:40 a.m., 1 minute after discovery.
