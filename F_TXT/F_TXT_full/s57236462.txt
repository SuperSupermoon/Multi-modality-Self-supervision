Since a recent radiograph of earlier the same date, the left lung demonstrates markedly improved aeration, likely due to resolution of the mucous plug. Residual partial atelectasis of the left lower lobe is demonstrated. Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and persistent pulmonary edema. Small to moderate right and small left pleural effusions are also noted. No visible pneumothorax.
