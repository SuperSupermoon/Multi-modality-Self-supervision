Left sided dual-chamber AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated, compatible with cardiomegaly and a moderate to large pleural effusion. Mediastinal and hilar contours appear relatively unchanged. There is a new focal opacity within the right upper lung field. Additionally there is mild pulmonary edema, with small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly progressed in the interval. Assessment of the lung apices is limited due to obscuration by the patient's chin. No large pneumothorax is identified but assessment is limited. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
