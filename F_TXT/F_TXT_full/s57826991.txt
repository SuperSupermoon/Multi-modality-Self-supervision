AP chest compared to ___: Global infiltrative pulmonary abnormality which has progressed in both lungs since ___ and is probably pulmonary edema, particularly given mediastinal venous engorgement, but areas of particular consolidation such as the axillary region of the left upper lobe, make concurrent pneumonia quite likely. Large air and fluid collection projecting over the right hilus is less obvious on this non-erect study. Volume of right pleural effusion is hard to assess, but increased over the past several days and more readily defined by recent CT scanning. No appreciable left pleural effusion.
