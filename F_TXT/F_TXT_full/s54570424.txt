Again seen is a left IJ central line with tip over mid/ distal SVC. No pneumothorax detected. Compared with 1 day earlier, hazy opacity at both lung bases has improved, suggesting interval improvement in bilateral effusions. Some residual hazy opacity is noted on the right, consistent with residual small effusion. Minimal patchy opacity at the right base is unchange . Focal pleural thickening along the right upper chest wall near the lung apex is unchanged.
