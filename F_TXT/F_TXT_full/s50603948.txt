Moderate right pleural effusion is reaccumulating despite the pigtail pleural drainage catheter at the lateral aspect of the right lung base, and mild pulmonary edema, somewhat asymmetric, has worsened since ___. There is no right pneumothorax. Previous right basal consolidation was dependent edema on ___ since it cleared dramatically later on ___. It recurred on ___ and is presumably edema once more. Otherwise I would suspect pneumonia. Only a small residual left pleural effusion remains, 3 pleural drains are still in place. Heart is mildly enlarged. No pneumothorax on either side. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow the expected courses.
