There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath catheter. The tip is not well visualized, but may overlie the lower right atrium as on the prior film. There are low inspiratory volumes, with patchy increased densities in both lungs. The patient has known pulmonary carcinomatosis, though superimposed processes would be difficult to exclude on this radiograph. There are pigtail catheters at both lung bases. On the left, there is a pneumothorax at the left lung base. On the right, no definite pneumothorax is detected, though a small right pleural effusion is present. The cardiac cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well delineated, but is probably unchanged. A stent overlies the mid abdomen and may represent a CBD stent.
