The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 2.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates near the inlet to the hemidiaphragm, probably in the distal esophagus. A left internal central jugular venous catheter terminates in the upper superior vena cava. The heart appears mildly rounded and perhaps enlarged. There is a pleural effusion on the left, probably small-to-moderate in size, with retrocardiac opacification, including air bronchograms, which is non-specific but often seen with atelectasis, although potentially aspiration or pneumonia could be considered. The right costophrenic angle is partly excluded, but visualized right lung fields appear clear.
