The patient is rotated. The newly placed endotracheal tube ends approximately 3 cm from the carina, and the neck appears to be flexed. Newly placed enteric tube traverses the diaphragm and the tip and side-port project over the left upper quadrant in a nondistended stomach. The right-sided Port-A-Cath tip is intact and unchanged in position, ending in the approximate region of the right upper atrium. Lung volumes remain low with bilateral atelectasis, improved on the right. Interval improvement in right pleural effusion. Heart size is difficult to assess given technique and lower lung volumes, but grossly appears similar the prior exam. No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
