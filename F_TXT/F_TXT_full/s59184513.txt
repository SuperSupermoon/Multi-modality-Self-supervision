Since a recent radiograph from earlier today, the patient has been intubated, with tip of tube terminating 4.7 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is been placed, terminating in the distal stomach. Allowing for lower lung volumes on the current radiograph, there has not been appreciable change in the appearance of the chest since the prior study of earlier today.
