An endotracheal tube is at the upper limits of normal in position, 6.2 cm above the carina, within the thoracic inlet. Enteric tube terminates in the stomach, although it is coiled once and points toward the esophagus. Lung volumes are low but improved. The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or airspace consolidation. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
