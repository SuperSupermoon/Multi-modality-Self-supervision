As compared to the previous image, the endotracheal tube was removed and replaced by a tracheostomy tube. The position of the tracheostomy tube is unremarkable, there is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The other monitoring and support devices, including the bilateral pigtail catheters in the pleural space are constant. On the right, the pleural effusion is constant but the degree of pulmonary over hydration might have minimally increased. On the left, the retrocardiac atelectasis has also increased. No new focal parenchymal opacity.
