Interval appearance of moderate perihilar and interstitial edema. Interval appearance of a left pleural effusion. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours cannot be adequately assessed due to marked patient rotation. Given the congestive heart failure, it is difficult to exclude superimposed infection, and therefore, followup imaging would be prudent. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
