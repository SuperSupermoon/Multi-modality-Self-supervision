A dual-lead left-sided AICD is seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. There is bibasilar atelectasis, less likely consolidations. The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. Otherwise, no evidence of large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. A tube/drain is partially imaged overlying the right upper quadrant.
