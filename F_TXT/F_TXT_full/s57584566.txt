AP single portable chest examination with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the frontal view of the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination. The right-sided rather massive pleural effusion may have increased slightly even when paying attention to possible changes in patient's position. Right lower lung area obscured by the pleural effusion. There are some scattered infiltrates in the left lung base, probably plate atelectasis. There is no evidence of left-sided pleural effusion as the lateral pleural sinus remains free.
