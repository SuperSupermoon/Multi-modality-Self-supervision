There is a the new left-sided chest tube wiith almost complete re-expansion of the left lung. There is still a small apical lateral pneumothorax. There is no mediastinal shift. There is dense retrocardiac opacification consistent with volume loss/ consolidation, which has increased compared to prior. The left clavicle fracture is more distracted on the current study with more than a shaft with displacement of the distal fragment with respect to the proximal fragment. There is subcutaneous emphysema, similar to prior
