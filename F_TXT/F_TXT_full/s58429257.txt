Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.5 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm into the left upper quadrant, inferior aspect not included on the image. The lungs remain hyperinflated and there is mild left basilar atelectasis. Spiculated left upper lobe pulmonary nodules seen on ___ CT, subtle suggestion of which is seen on the current study, better assessed on CT. There now appears to be increased opacity in that region along the left mid lung, underlying infection not excluded. Additional smaller bilateral pulmonary nodules also better assessed on CT. Patient has known destructive lesions involving the right sixth and ninth ribs which are also seen on this study. There is questionable lucency also involving the lateral right seventh rib. Right chest wall opacity associated with the right sixth rib is discussed with lesion again seen. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
