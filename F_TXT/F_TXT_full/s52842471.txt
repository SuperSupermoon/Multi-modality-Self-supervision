A Dobhoff-type tube is present, new compared with the prior film. On the current film, it is hairpin-curved in the lower esophagus and the distal radiopaque segment turns upward, now overlying the upper esophagus -- this should be repositioned. Compared with earlier the same day, there has been slight improvement in opacity at the left base and some new linear atelectasis at the right lung. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. No pneumothorax detected. Findings paged to Dr. ___ at the time of discovery at 3:10 p.m. on the day of the exam. Second page sent at 4:53 pm and finding discussed with Dr ___ at that time (___, phone).
