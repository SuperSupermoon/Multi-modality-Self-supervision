Single portable view of the chest. The lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, noting prominence of the upper mediastinum, which is due to tortuosity of the vessels as seen on CTA neck recently performed. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable with a tortuous descending thoracic aorta. Degenerative change is seen at the right shoulder.
