As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal completely unchanged parenchymal opacity at the right lung bases. Stability of this change is suggesting atelectasis rather than pneumonia. Otherwise the lung parenchyma is unremarkable. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema. Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
