As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased, causing an apparent increase in extent of the bilateral parenchymal opacity at the lung bases. However, no new opacities are seen. Mild pulmonary edema persists. No pneumothorax. The right pectoral Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position.
