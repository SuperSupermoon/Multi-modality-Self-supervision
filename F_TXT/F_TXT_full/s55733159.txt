Left-sided AICD/ pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right ventricle and region of the coronary sinus. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged with calcification of the thoracic aorta noted. Increased interstitial markings are seen, most pronounced along the periphery of the lungs and within the upper lobes suggestive of a chronic interstitial lung disease. There may be mild interstitial pulmonary edema superimposed. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is detected. Degenerative changes are seen within the right glenohumeral joint.
