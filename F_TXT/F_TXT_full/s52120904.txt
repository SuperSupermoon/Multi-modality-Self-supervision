Dobhoff tube tip appears to be most likely in the third/ forth part of the duodenum. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right PICC line tip is in the proximal right atrium and should be pulled back 2 cm to secure it position at the cavoatrial junction or above. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. The ET tube has been discontinued. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has progressed in the interim, potentially related to extubation.
