CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present. The tip is not optimally visualized but it appears to lie approximately 6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, the tip is not well seen but appears to lie below the level of the diaphragm. Right subclavian central line tip overlies the mid SVC. There is slightly rotated positioning. Even allowing for this, there appears to be volume loss on the right side, with shift of the mediastinum to the right. This is in keeping with the findings on targeted review of a chest CT from ___. There is a probable right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is a small-to-moderate left effusion, also with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Doubt overt CHF. Cardiomediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to distorted anatomy.
