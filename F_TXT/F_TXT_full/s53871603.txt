Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There is interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating in the low SVC without findings to suggest pneumothorax. Left base retrocardiac opacity appears increased, consistent with known left lower lobe collapse seen on preceding CT with small right pleural effusion. Right basilar atelectasis/consolidation seen on preceding CT is not well appreciated on the current study. There is no large right pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
