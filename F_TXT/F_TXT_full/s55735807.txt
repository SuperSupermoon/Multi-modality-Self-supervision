Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube which terminates 4 cm above the level of the carina in appropriate position. An enteric tube descends in an uncomplicated course to the distal esophagus, its end out of view. A right jugular line ends at the low superior vena cava. Allowing for changes in patient positioning, the lungs appear largely unchanged with mildly increased interstitial edema. There is no new focal consolidation. There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
