Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier. There is no evident pneumothorax. Small right effusion has decreased. Cardiac size is top normal, accentuated by the projection. Widened mediastinum due to known mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Small-to-moderate left effusion is unchanged. Asymmetric mild pulmonary edema worse on the right has minimally increased from prior study.
