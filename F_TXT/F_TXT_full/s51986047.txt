Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There has been no interval change. There is again seen a right-sided pleural effusion and consolidation within the right base. No pneumothoraces are seen on either side. There is some prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings and there is a hazy opacity within the left mid lung field, which may represent developing infiltrate. Attention to this area is recommended on subsequent exams.
