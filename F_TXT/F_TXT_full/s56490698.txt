Cardiac silhouette has slightly decreased in size compared to previous study and is associated with improved pulmonary vascular congestion. Previously described right lower lobe opacity has resolved and probably reflected asymmetrical edema rather than infection. There has also been improved aeration in the left lower lobe with a residual asymmetrical opacity peripherally, for which short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to ensure resolution.
