Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina with the neck in a flexed position, and a nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, but the side port of this device is not confidently visualized. Lung volumes remain low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Worsening opacities are present at both lung bases, involving the left lower lobe to a greater degree than the right. Though nonspecific, these findings may be due to aspiration pneumonia given clinical suspicion for this entity.
