AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are low and the mediastinum is wider following tracheal extubation, as expected. Mediastinal widening reflects venous engorgement. Lungs are free of focal abnormality. Post-operative enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is roughly comparable to the preoperative diameter. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are small. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the proximal pulmonary artery, left pleural and midline drains still in place.
