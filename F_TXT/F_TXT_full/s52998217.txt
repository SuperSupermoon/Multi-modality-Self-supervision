There is a left-sided subclavian line, which appears to terminate in the mid SVC. There is an enteric tube with the tip likely in the antrum of the stomach. The lung volumes are low; however, there appears to be opacification of the left lung base, likely secondary to atelectasis. Note is made of mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
