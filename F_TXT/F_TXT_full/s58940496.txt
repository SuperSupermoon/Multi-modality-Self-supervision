The lower left chest wall and left costophrenic angle are excluded from the film. The left base is somewhat obscured by overlying breast tissue. Again seen is a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter. The tip is in similar position, overlying the distal right pulmonary artery, possibly an inferior lobe range. Better appreciated on the current exam, but unchanged, there is a loop of catheter overlying the right heart which appears represent a loop within the Swan-Ganz catheter. Again noted is a left-sided pacemaker with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle and additional leads overlying the upper left heart border. No pneumothorax detected. As before, there is marked cardiomegaly, with extreme left cardiac apex excluded from this film. Again seen is prominent upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, which appears slightly improved compared with the prior film. There is retrocardiac density, similar to the prior study, possibly very slightly improved. No gross right effusion. Left costophrenic angle excluded from film. Incidental note is made of clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
