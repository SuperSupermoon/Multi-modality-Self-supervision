As compared to the previous radiograph, the pleural effusions bilaterally have not substantially changed. The pigtail catheter on the right has obviously been pulled back. It is not sure whether the catheter is still located in the pleural space. Moderate cardiomegaly, moderate retrocardiac atelectasis.
