AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. The right internal jugular line has been discontinued. There is interval development of vascular engorgement most likely consistent with pulmonary edema. There is more focal right upper lobe opacity, most likely part of the edema, but focal consolidation cannot be excluded due to pneumonia. Bilateral pleural effusions have increased. Left lower lobe opacity has increased , most likely represents part of the edema, but infectious process is a possibility. Re-assessment of the patient after diuresis is required.
