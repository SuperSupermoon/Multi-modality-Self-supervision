The position of the left chest tube is difficult to assess, as its tip is presumed to be superimposed over ribs and bowel. There is residual left pleural effusion. Lung volumes are low, producing bronchovascular crowding and basilar atelectasis, and making assessment of the lung bases difficult. No pneumothorax or large right pleural effusion.
