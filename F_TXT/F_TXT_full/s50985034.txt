In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the opacification at the right base. This could well reflect chronic pleural thickening with small effusion and basilar atelectasis. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. The left lung is essentially clear with possibly mild atelectatic changes at the base. There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 2.7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the upper stomach with the side hole beyond the esophagogastric junction. Right subclavian PICC line remains in position.
