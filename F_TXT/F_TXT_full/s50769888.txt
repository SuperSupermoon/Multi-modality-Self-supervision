As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. Small bilateral pleural effusions are seen, but there is no overt pulmonary edema. The parenchymal scars at both apices and at the lung bases are constant in appearance. There is no evidence of new parenchymal opacities potentially suggestive of pneumonia. Borderline of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
