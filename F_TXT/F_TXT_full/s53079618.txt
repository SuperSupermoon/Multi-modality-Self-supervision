Left upper lobe collapse has resolved, and mediastinum has partially returned to the midline position. New opacification in the left lower lobe is probably developing atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion persists despite the basal pleural catheter. There is no left pneumothorax. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion on the right, basal pleural drain in place has repositioned. Previous pulmonary vascular congestion, particularly in the right lung, has improved. Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged.
