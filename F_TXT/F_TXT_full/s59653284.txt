In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta and some residual indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. Prominence of the central pulmonary vessels is consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension. No definite evidence of acute focal pneumonia or pneumothorax.
