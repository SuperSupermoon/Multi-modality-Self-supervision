The patient is status post previous median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery. Heart is upper limits of normal in size, and likely slightly accentuated by portable technique and rightward patient rotation. Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Lungs are grossly clear. Apparent slight lateral blunting of right costophrenic sulcus could reflect right pleural effusion or pleural thickening, and followup PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful to better evaluate this region when the patient's condition permits.
