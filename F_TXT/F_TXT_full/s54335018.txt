A new drainage catheter projects over the mid hemithorax. An associated fluid collection appears decreased but a small opacity suggesting residual fluid projecting over the right mid hemithorax. Two drainage catheters projecting over the left mid-to-lower hemithorax appear unchanged with persistent widespread retrocardiac opacification and probably a residual small pleural effusion. Left perihilar opacity is stable. Streaky opacities at the right base remain, but for the most part, aeration has improved substantially in the right lower lung. A PICC line courses into the superior vena cava from a right-sided approach. Its tip is difficult to visualize because of coinciding three-lead pacemaker/ICD device, but it probably terminates in the superior vena cava.
