A left PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery. Extensive calcifications of the right than left main bronchi are re- demonstrated. As compared to most recent prior radiograph there is interval mild additional progression of interstitial pulmonary edema. Right lower lobe consolidation is present, as conspicuous and asymmetric as on the previous examination and might reflect coexisting right lower lobe pneumonia. Bilateral pleural effusions are at least moderate. There is no pneumothorax.
