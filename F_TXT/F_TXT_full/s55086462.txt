Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to intraoperative study obtained the same day earlier. Overall, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is a minimal questionable left apical pneumothorax. Right and left chest tubes are in place. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been re-adjusted with its tip at the level of the right main pulmonary artery. Opacity surrounding the pre-existing aortic stenting is re-demonstrated, overall unchanged since the prior study. Subcutaneous air is minimal.
