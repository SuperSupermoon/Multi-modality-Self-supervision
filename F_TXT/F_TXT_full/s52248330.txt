A frontal semi upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends 4.2 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube follows the expected course although the tip is not visualized. The left internal jugular catheter ends at the brachiocephalic SVC confluence. Left basilar pneumonia is slightly improved. Right basilar atelectasis persists. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
