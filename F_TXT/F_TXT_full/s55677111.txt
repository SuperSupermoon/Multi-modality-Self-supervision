Volume of bilateral pneumothorax can be underestimated due to semi supine positioning. It is at least small, left greater than right, but has not changed over the past several days. Left upper thoracostomy tube is in stable position, but there has been some redistribution of subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall. I do not see a drain on the right. Pneumomediastinum has not worsened over the past several days. Heart is normal size. Moderately extensive heterogeneous opacification has been stable in both lungs over the past 4 days having developed since the initial intake chest CT on ___ when the only lung abnormalities were mild contusion in the right lower lobe and left upper lobe collapse that subsequently cleared. Current findings therefore suggest pneumonia, with either pneumatoceles or cavities. ET tube and right subclavian line are in standard placements and a esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
