An endotracheal tube is noted with the tip terminating approximately 5.1 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view radiograph. Lung volumes are low leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted. The upper lung fields are grossly clear. The cardiac size is difficult to assess but appears within normal limits.
