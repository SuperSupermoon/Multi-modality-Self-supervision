Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes. Streaky right basilar airspace opacities are relatively unchanged compared to the prior examination and likely represent vascular crowding and atelectasis; however, an underlying consolidation cannot be entirely excluded. Prominent vascular markings in the upper lungs suggest mild pulmonary edema, unchanged. Cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable. Calcifications are again noted in the aortic arch. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina. Presumed NG tube courses along the midline passing the diaphragm, tip is not included on the image. There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
