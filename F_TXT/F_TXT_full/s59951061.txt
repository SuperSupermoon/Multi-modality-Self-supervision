As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3.4 cm above the carina. Likely given the ventilatory pressure, the extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities have minimally decreased in severity. No pleural effusions. No complications, notably no pneumothorax.
