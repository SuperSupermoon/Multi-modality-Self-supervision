Persistent cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and mild-to-moderate edema. A more confluent opacity in the left retrocardiac region has slightly worsened, and could reflect asymmetrical edema and atelectasis, but a developing infectious pneumonia is also possible given history of fevers. Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
