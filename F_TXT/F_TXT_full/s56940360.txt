As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an endotracheal tube. The tip of the tube projects 4.8 cm above the carina. The patient has also received a nasogastric tube. The sidehole is approximately 1 to 2 cm distal off the gastroesophageal junction. The extensive left upper lobe opacities and the small right basal atelectasis are unchanged. The retrocardiac and left basal lung areas show minimally improved ventilation.
