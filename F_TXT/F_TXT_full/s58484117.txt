The heart is normal in size. There is slight unfolding of the lower descending thoracic aorta. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. There is a patchy opacity in the medial lower and right mid lung, most consistent with pneumonia. Since the cardiac border can mostly be discerned, the abnormality is suspected to at least predominantly reside in the right lower lobe.
