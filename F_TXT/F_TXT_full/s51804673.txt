In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the pulmonary outflow tract. Nasogastric tube extends at least to the mid body of the stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the image. There is engorgement and indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in left lower lobe and pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax.
