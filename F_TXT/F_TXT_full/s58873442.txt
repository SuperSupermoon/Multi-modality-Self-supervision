In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta. Increased opacification at the bases with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms suggests layering pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax. Some residual subcutaneous gas is seen, primarily along the right upper abdomen.
