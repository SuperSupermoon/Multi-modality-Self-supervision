As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. Swan-Ganz catheter is still too distal, the device should be pulled back by approximately 8 cm to assume location within the mediastinal borders and in the central parts of the pulmonary artery. The stomach continues to be mildly overinflated, despite the placement of a feeding tube. Moderate cardiomegaly with signs of mild fluid overload and bilateral parenchymal opacities, predominantly in the hilar lung areas. Minimal increase in extent of a pre-existing right pleural effusion. On occasion of the previous radiograph, the referring physician was already contacted for repositioning of the Swan-Ganz catheter.
