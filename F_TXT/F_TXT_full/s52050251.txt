Right chest tube with the tip at the right base and a right internal jugular central venous catheter with tip in the upper SVC appear unchanged. Median sternotomy wires appear intact and aligned. Otherwise, there is little interval change in comparison to the prior study. It is difficult to exclude tiny right basilar pneumothorax. There is no shift of midline structures. Postsurgical appearance of the heart appears stable. Subcutaneous air is again noted in the right axilla and flank. Atelectatic changes are again noted at the left base.
