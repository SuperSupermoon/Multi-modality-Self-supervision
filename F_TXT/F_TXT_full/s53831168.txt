AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. A very high positioned diaphragms is present in this patient with evidence of massive ascites. Heart size cannot be determined as contours are concealed. On the right side, the lateral pleural sinus is free, but there is a diffuse haze on the left base consistent with some pleural effusion probably layering posteriorly in the semi-upright positioned patient. Both lungs are aerated and there is no evidence of any apical pneumothorax.
