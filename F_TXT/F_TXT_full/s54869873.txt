The patient is after aortic valve replacement. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Pacemaker defibrillator leads are unchanged in appearance. Lungs are essentially clear except for minimal bibasal opacity, right more than left most likely representing atelectasis and less likely aspiration. Known mild vascular congestion is present but no overt pulmonary edema is seen. No pneumothorax is noted.
