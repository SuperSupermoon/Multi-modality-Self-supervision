As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated, the nasogastric tube and the Swan-___ catheter have been removed. The bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal drains remain in place. A venous introduction sheath is seen in the left internal jugular vein. After extubation, the lung volumes have slightly decreased, with slightly increasing atelectatic changes at both lung bases. However, there is no evidence of substantial fluid overload or pleural effusions. No other parenchymal abnormalities. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
