In comparison with the study ___, there is little change in the right basilar opacification most likely representing pneumonia. Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is again consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. The tip of the Port-A-Cath again extends to the lower SVC or cavoatrial junction.
