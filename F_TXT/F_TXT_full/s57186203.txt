Compared to the prior study, the previously seen right upper lobe pneumothorax is no longer visualized. A rim of density along the periphery of the lung could represent pleural fluid, but no fluid level to indicate the presence of a hydro pneumothorax is detected. Small right effusion again noted, possibly slightly larger. Parenchymal changes in both upper lobes as well as the right upper lobe iatrogenic IB valves are noted. Probable slight hyperinflation in the left lung, unchanged. Possible mild diffuse iatrogenic mild diffuse vascular plethora, more than on the prior film, those could also be artifact due to respiratory motion and blurring.
