AP chest compared to preoperative chest radiograph, ___: Mediastinal vascular engorgement, slight increase in heart size and pulmonary vascular congestion most readily explained by volume overload. New right infrahilar opacification, most likely atelectasis, should be followed to exclude pneumonia. Upper enteric tube ends in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
