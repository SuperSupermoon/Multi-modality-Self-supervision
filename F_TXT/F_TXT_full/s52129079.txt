There has been interval improved appearance of the lungs with more well- defined vasculature and decreased left effusion. However, there continues to be a dense left upper lobe infiltrate. It is unclear how much of this is due to volume loss/retained secretions or if there could be an underlying infectious infiltrate. There continue to be patchy areas of alveolar edema; however, the overall appearance of the lungs is markedly improved compared to the study from the prior day. The supporting devices, lines and tubes appear similar compared to prior.
