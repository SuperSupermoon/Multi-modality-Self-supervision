Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal enlargement. Layering bilateral effusions with bibasilar patchy opacities likely representing lower lobe atelectasis. Prominent perihilar vasculature likely reflects combination of low lung volumes and residual perihilar edema. No pneumothorax.
