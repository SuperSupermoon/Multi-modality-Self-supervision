The lung volumes are extremely low. Crowding of the vasculature is likely due to the low lung volumes, rather than pulmonary edema. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is a displaced fracture through the surgical neck of the humerus, which is only evaluated in one AP view. No definite rib or spine fracture is visualized on this limited supine exam.
