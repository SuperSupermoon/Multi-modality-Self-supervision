1. The endotracheal tube still remains high lying with its tip approximately 7.8 cm above the carina. Advancement by additional 2 to 3 cm would be recommended. The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. Left basilar chest tube is unchanged. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There continues to be near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax with suggestion of some air bronchograms in the left mid lung. The right lung is low in volume and shows some vascular congestion in the perihilar region, but no focal airspace consolidation. No pneumothorax is seen. Dr. ___ was notified of the need for re-positioning of the endotracheal tube on ___ at 11:20 a.m. by text page.
