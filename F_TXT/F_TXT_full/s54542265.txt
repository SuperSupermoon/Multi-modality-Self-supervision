There has been placement of an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 2.5 cm above the carina. There is a feeding tube whose distal tip and side port are below the GE junction. There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip in distal SVC. Since the previous study from ___, there has been development of diffuse nodular airspace opacities throughout both lung fields. Given the history of lymphoma, this may represent recurrent disease. Underlying infectious/inflammatory etiology is felt less likely but possible.
