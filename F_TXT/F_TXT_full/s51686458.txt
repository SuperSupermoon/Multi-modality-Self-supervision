Endotracheal tube terminates 4.8 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach. A lucency over the left hemithorax suggests pneumothorax and correlation with soon-to-be obtained chest CT is recommended. Opacification of the right lung could reflect a combination of atelectasis and/or aspiration given the patient's history. Extensive thoracic spine scoliosis with rod fixation is noted but incompletely assessed. Cardiac size and cardiomediastinal contours are grossly normal.
