AP upright view of the chest was obtained. A 13 mm calcified nodule overlies the left clavicle and likely represents a granuloma. Otherwise, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. There is no free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
