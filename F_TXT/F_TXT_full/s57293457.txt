Left PICC has been withdrawn by several centimeters, with the distal tip now terminating in the region of the left subclavian vein at the level of the middle third of the left clavicle. Heart size remains normal. Multifocal pulmonary opacities with basilar predominance have slightly worsened in the left lower lobe in the interval. Additionally, multiple poorly defined nodular opacities persist bilaterally. These findings may reflect a combination of infection and hemorrhage in this patient with history of vasculitis. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged, but a moderate left pleural effusion has increased in size. Multifocal sclerotic skeletal lesions are unchanged and more fully characterized on CT. Healed rib fractures are also noted.
