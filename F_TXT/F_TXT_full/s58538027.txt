Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. No focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly stable given differences in technique and patient position. Chronic-appearing deformity is seen at the distal right clavicle.
