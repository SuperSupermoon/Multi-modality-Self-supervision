Compared to the prior film, the opacity at the right lung base laterally has progressed slightly. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is the NG tube extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film. Also again seen is a left IJ central line, tip over the right atrium, unchanged -- as before, consider retraction by approximately 4 cm to position at in the lower SVC. Suspect background COPD. There is cardiomegaly with upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. No gross effusion. Densities overlying the lower thoracic spine are consistent with prior kypho- or vertebroplasty.
