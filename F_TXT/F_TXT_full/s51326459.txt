The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with the heart in the upper limits of normal. The lungs are well expanded. Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities and prominent interstitial markings in the right lung base, indicate mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. A small right pleural effusion is present. There is no pneumothorax. No consolidation is identified to suggest pneumonia.
