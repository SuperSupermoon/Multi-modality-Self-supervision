1. Endotracheal tube has its tip 5.4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Volumes remain low with crowding of the pulmonary vascularity. However, the pulmonary vascularity does appear more indistinct when compared to the preoperative study and therefore, this likely represents an element of superimposed mild interstitial edema. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient rotation between the studies. Hardware overlies the lower cervical spine. There are degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint with flattening of the humeral head and associated sclerosis which raises concern for avascular necrosis secondary to prior humeral head fracture. Clinical correlation is advised.
