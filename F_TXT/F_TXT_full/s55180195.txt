Focal opacity within the left lung apex corresponds with a pleural-based lesion seen on prior CT. There is borderline upper zone redistribution and bibasilar atelectasis. No overt chf, focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is tracheal deviation to the right secondary to a large mass in the left thyroid gland as seen on concurrent CT. Multiple healed right-sided rib fractures are noted.
