AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Poor inspirational effort explains high positioned diaphragm obscuring major portions of the heart shadow. Crowded pulmonary vasculature on the bases is explained by this poor inspiration. In addition, there are still remaining plate atelectases bilaterally. Pulmonary vasculature pattern is less congested, and the degree of perivascular haze is less marked. This coincides with lesser prominence of the previously increasing fluid accumulation in the minor fissure. No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen, and no pneumothorax exists in the apical area.
