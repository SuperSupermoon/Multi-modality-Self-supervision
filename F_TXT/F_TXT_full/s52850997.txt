Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest provided. There are bilateral partially layering pleural effusions, which appear similar to prior exam allowing for differences in patient positioning. Mild edema is difficult to exclude. Consolidations in the lower lungs are most compatible with compressive lower lobe atelectasis, though a superimposed pneumonia may be present. No definite signs of pneumothorax. Heart size cannot be assessed. Mediastinal contour is suboptimally assessed due to patient rightward rotation. Bony structures appear intact.
