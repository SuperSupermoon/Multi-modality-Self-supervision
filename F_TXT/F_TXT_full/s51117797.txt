Persistent cardiomegaly accompanied by worsening pulmonary vascular congestion and mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema as well as enlarging right pleural effusion, now moderate in size and associated with adjacent atelectasis in the right mid and lower lung regions. Focal rounded opacity lateral to the left infrahilar region may represent a focus of coalescing edema, but differential diagnosis includes focal aspiration and developing infection. Attention to this region on a short-term followup radiograph is suggested.
