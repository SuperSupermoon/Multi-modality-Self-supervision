AP chest compared to ___: Moderate left pleural effusion has increased, and aeration at the left lung base is worse. There is no pneumothorax. Two left apical and a basal pleural tube are unchanged in their respective positions. Heart size is partially obscured but probably not enlarged. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged though different in distribution. Subsequent chest radiograph available at the time of this review, performed at 5:28 a.m. shows no subsequent change. There is no pneumothorax.
