Comparison is made with prior study performed five hours earlier. There has been no change in right pneumothorax seen in the lower hemithorax. Adjacent lung opacity is stable. Basal right chest tube is in unchanged position. Small right effusion has decreased. There has been interval improvement in aeration of the right upper lung. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. The left lung again demonstrates ill-defined perihilar and retrocardiac opacities, better seen in prior CT, and there is no left effusion or left pneumothorax. Cardiac lead is in standard position.
