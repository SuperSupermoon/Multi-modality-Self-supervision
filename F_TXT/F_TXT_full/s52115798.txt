A right internal jugular central venous line terminates at the cavoatrial junction, and an endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.0 cm above the level of carina. Bilateral airspace opacities and a right upper lobe cavity are essentially unchanged from prior examination. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Calcifications are noted at the aortic arch.
