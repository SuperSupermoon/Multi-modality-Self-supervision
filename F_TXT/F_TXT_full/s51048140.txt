Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Dobbhoff tube has been pulled back and the tip is in the distal stomach/antrum. Evaluation of the lungs is limited due to the projection. Still diffuse opacities in the left perihilar region and lower lobes bilaterally, left greater than right, are present and unchanged. These opacities have wide radiologic differential diagnosis include aspiration pneumonia and asymmetric pulmonary edema. The component of pulmonary edema has minimally improved prior study.
