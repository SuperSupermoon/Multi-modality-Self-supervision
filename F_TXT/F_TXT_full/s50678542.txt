As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2 cm above the carina, the tube should be pulled back by approximately 1 to 2 cm. The left PICC line and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. Mildly increasing retrocardiac atelectasis. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. The presence of small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded. Atelectasis are seen at both the left and the right lung bases, but there is no evidence of pneumonia.
