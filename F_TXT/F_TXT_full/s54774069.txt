As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 7.5 cm above the carina. The tube needs to be advanced by at least 2-3 cm. The patient has also received a right subclavian catheter. The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip projects over the lower SVC. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The small right effusion and subsequent atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions have increased in extent and severity. New atelectasis has appeared at the bases of the right lung. Close followup is required to exclude early pneumonia. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
