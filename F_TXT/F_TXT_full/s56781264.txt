An endotracheal tube is seen in standard position for a right internal jugular line terminates in the lower SVC. An alimentary tube is seen passing into the stomach and below the field of view. The lung volumes are low. There is bibasilar atelectasis and the low lung volumes may potentially exaggerate opacification of the right base. A small right pleural effusion is present. There is no pneumothorax.
