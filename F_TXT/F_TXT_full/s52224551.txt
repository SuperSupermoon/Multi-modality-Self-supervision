AP view of the chest provided. NG tube has turned in the mid esophagus and courses cephalad, terminating likely in the oropharynx. Endotracheal tube and hemodialysis line are in unchanged positions. The left hemidiaphgram is obscured, likely from atelectasis. There is hazy opacity overlying the hemidiaphragm, reflective of layering pleural effusion and loss of lung volume. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is again seen. A heart size is stably enlarged.
