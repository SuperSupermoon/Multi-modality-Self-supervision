Single portable view of the chest. Low lung volumes seen on the current exam. Linear right basilar opacity laterally obscuring the costophrenic angle may be due to atelectasis. Superiorly, the lungs are clear. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but likely accentuated due to low lung volumes and not definitely changed from prior.
