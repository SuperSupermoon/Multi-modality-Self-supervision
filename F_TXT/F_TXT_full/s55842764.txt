In comparison with the study of ___, there are minimally improved lung volumes. Left base opacification with obscuration hemidiaphragm is unchanged, consistent with pleural fluid and substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. Minimal changes are seen at the right base. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels again is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
