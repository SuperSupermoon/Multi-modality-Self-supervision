Study is limited by patient positioning and patient's left arm obscuring assessment of the left costophrenic angle. The heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Minimal patchy opacities are seen within the left lung base, which could reflect atelectasis. Assessment for a left-sided pleural effusion is limited as the patient's arm obscures this area. No right-sided focal consolidation is seen. There is no pneumothorax. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.
