An ET tube is present. Level of the ETT tip is difficult to determine given obscuration by spinal fixation hardware. The tube cannot be traced beyond level of the thoracic inlet on this film. NG tube present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Left IJ Swan-Ganz catheter present, tip overlying the pulmonary outflow tract. Bilateral chest tubes. No pneumothorax detected. Mediastinal drains are likely present. Note made of prosthetic valves, unchanged. Allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. Again seen is diffuse opacity in both lungs and dense retrocardiac opacity with obscuration left hemidiaphragm. The right hemidiaphragm is also not well delineated. Small pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude. Background scoliosis noted, not fully evaluated.
