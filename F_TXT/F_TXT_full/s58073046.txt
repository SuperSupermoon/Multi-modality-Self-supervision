Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube with tip extending to 4.2 cm above the carina. There is increased obscuration of the aortic contour and left cardiac border and more confluent left lower lobe opacity without airbronchograms, consistent with increased extent of atelectasis, now of the left middle and lower lobes. There may be a small left pleural effusion. Left upper lung and right lung appear well aerated. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is no pulmonary edema.
