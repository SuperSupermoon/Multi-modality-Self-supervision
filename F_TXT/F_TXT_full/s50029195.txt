Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. There is slight interval increase in left pleural effusion.

Overall no substantial change since previous examination demonstrated, but developing pneumonia in particular in the left mid lung cannot be excluded and reassessment with chest radiograph in 24 hr is recommended. .
