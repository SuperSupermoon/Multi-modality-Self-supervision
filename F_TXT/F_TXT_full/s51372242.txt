Left pectoral pacemaker and its leads are in unchanged positions. There is new left lung base opacity in the retrocardiac region, likely reflecting left lower lobe atelectasis. There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Right lung base atelectasis is increased. New opacity in the right upper lung may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema. Moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette is similar to before. Focal deformity at the right first rib is unchanged.
