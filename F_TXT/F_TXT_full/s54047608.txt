Lung volumes remain low. Silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm and blunting of the left costophrenic angle is new compared to the prior exam and suggest presence of small pleural effusion. Is probably also atelectasis. There is moderate pulmonary edema. Heart size is probably a moderate to severely enlarged, even in the setting of low lung volumes and portable technique. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. Severe pulmonary vascular engorgement is overall unchanged. Right infrahilar opacity may reflect combination of atelectasis, edema. Concurrent infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. Extensive aortic knob calcifications are unchanged.
