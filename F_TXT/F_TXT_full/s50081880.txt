Low lung volumes are present which cause crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is no pulmonary edema. There has been interval removal of the right-sided PIC line. There is mild cardiomegaly. There is a tracheostomy tube, with an overlying rebreather mask limiting assessment of the upper lungs. There is mild right basilar atelectasis. There is a patchy opacity in the left lung base, which could be secondary to atelectasis, however pneumonia cannot be ruled out. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. A small left pleural effusion is likely present.
