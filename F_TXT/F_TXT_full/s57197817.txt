As compared to the previous image, the lung volumes have decreased. This might reflect a physiologic change or change in the ventilatory pressure. The aortic valve and the sternal fixation devices are in unchanged position. Unchanged is the position and course of the monitoring and support devices, including the hemodialysis catheter, the right chest tube, the endotracheal tube and the PICC line. Considering the lower lung volumes, the severity of the pre-existing pulmonary edema is probably unchanged. The extent of the left pleural effusion, combined to subsequent left lower lung atelectasis, is constant. There currently is no visible pneumothorax.
