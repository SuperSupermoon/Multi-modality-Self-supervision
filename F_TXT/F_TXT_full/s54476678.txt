There is moderate vascular congestion and an enlarged cardiac silhouette, which suggests mild pulmonary edema. There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions. There are consolidations in the lower lobes bilaterally which could simply be areas of lung collapse, however pneumonia cannot be ruled out on this exam. Recommend repeat chest radiograph after diuresis to rule out pneumonia at the lung bases.
