There is a moderate-to-large left-sided pleural effusion, new since the prior study. There is no shift of mediastinal structures. Probably, there is substantial associated atelectasis involving the left lower lobe and possibly parts of the lingula. The pulmonary vasculature is mildly prominent. There is no pleural effusion on the right. No pneumothorax is identified.
