Interval insertion of a left PleurX catheter has resulted in a small left pneumothorax with apical and medial components. No evidence of mediastinal shift. A small left and trace right pleural effusions are decreased from earlier today. A right chest central venous catheter terminates in the right atrium, unchanged.
