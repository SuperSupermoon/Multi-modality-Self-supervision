The lungs are normally expanded. Haziness in the right infrahilar region is somewhat more prominent since the prior study. No other focal airspace opacity is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is prominence of predominantly large bowel in the upper abdomen, although this is nonspecific.
