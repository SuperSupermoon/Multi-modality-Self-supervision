No comparison. On the current image, a device appears to be coiled in the pharynx. However, no endotracheal tube is visualized in tracheal position. Low lung volumes. Predominantly interstitial bilateral basal parenchymal opacities, potentially reflecting pneumonia or aspiration. No larger pleural effusions. Mild retrocardiac atelectasis. No pneumothorax. The coiled device needs to be repositioned.
