Heart size is top normal with mild tortuosity of thoracic aorta. Hilar contours are unremarkable. There are extensive consolidations in the right lower lobe compatible with pneumonia. Lung is essentially clear with the exception of base atelectasis. Smaller consolidation and a small left pleural effusion is larger or more readily apparent that it was 7 hours earlier. There is no pneumothorax.
