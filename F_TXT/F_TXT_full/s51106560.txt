Interval placement of a right subclavian PICC line which has its tip in the distal SVC at the cavoatrial junction 5 cm below the carina. Interval removal of the left subclavian PICC line. There is circumferential right pleural opacity with substantial volume loss of the right lung which most likely reflects an enlarging pleural effusion or hemorrhage with partial collapse of the right middle and lower lobes. Clinical correlation is recommended. The left lung is grossly clear. Cardiac mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the right sided opacification. The pulmonary vasculature is prominent but there is no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
