An NG tube is present, with its tip overlying the proximal stomach. There is suggestion that the side port lies in the region of the GE junction, though not necessarily beyond that. Right subclavian PICC line tip overlies the distal SVC. No pneumothorax detected. Again seen are low inspiratory volumes with patchy opacities at both lung bases, similar to prior. No new focal opacity is identified. There is pulmonary vascular plethora which could reflect CHF, but is likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. Note is made of thinned wire like leads coursing across the right chest into the neck.
