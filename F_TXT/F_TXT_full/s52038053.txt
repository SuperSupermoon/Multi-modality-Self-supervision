There is a left-sided chest tube which appears to terminate medially overlying the middle left lung. Again the lung volumes are low limiting assessment of the lung parenchyma however there is bibasilar atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, otherwise the cardiomediastinal contours are stable. The rib fractures noted on the prior CT are not well visualized on this exam.
