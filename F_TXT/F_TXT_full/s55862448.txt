There are low inspiratory volumes. Compared with ___, the ET tube and NG tube abdomen removed. The left and right IJ lines are grossly unchanged. No pneumothorax is detected. Mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and could be accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. Again seen is hazy opacity in both lungs, diffusely on the left and more pronounced at the base on the right. This is thought to represent resolving previously seen opacities --? Pulmonary edema, but hemorrhage or massive aspiration have been alternative imaging explanations for this. No new opacity or pleural effusion is detected.

Of note, limited assessment of the upper abdomen shows mild dilatation of small bowel loops in the abdomen, without fluid levels in with decompressed large bowel .
