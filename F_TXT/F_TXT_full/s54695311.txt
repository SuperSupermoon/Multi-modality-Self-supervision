There has been interval placement of an enteric tube which ends in the distal trachea. The accessed left chest wall Infuse-A-Port an enteric tube are unchanged in position. There is new right-sided volume loss with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and superior displacement of the minor fissure, which are likely due to right upper lobe atelectasis. There is also new right lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis. New rapidly developing right lung airspace opacities containing small air bronchograms may be due to aspiration or confluent edema. Hazy opacification over the left lung base may be due to worsening atelectasis or a small layering left pleural effusion. The right costophrenic angle has been excluded from the field of view, limiting assessment for a pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits despite the projection.
