CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Rotated positioning. The ET tube is present, 5.0 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm, overlying the stomach. A dual-lumen right IJ catheter is present, with lead tips over distal SVC and upper right atrium. A left-sided PICC line is present, tip over proximal SVC. There are low inspiratory volumes, with pulmonary vascular plethora, consistent with CHF. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. The possibility of small effusions cannot be excluded. Compared with ___ at 2:04 a.m., and allowing for technical differences, I doubt significant interval change.
