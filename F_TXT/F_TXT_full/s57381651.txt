Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.1 cm above the level of the carina. Underlying trauma board partially obscures the view. Given this, lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No displaced fracture is seen. There is mild thoracolumbar scoliosis.
