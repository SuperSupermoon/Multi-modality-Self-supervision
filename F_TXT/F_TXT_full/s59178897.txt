Massive bilateral air collections in the soft tissues. The left chest tube is in unchanged position. As on the previous examination, there is a parenchymal left base opacity suspicious for pneumonia or parenchymal bleeding. The previously seen pleural, pericardial and potential mediastinal air inclusions on the lateral radiograph are not precisely identified on the current image. However, the very sharp right heart border might be interpreted as indirect sign for pneumopericardium. No other relevant changes.
