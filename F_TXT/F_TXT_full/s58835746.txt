Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates well-expanded and clear lungs. The ascending and descending aorta is torturous. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A right paratracheal mass projecting at the level of the azygous vein corresponds to previosly identified mediastinal lymph node on chest CT dated ___. The subcarinal node identified on CT is not well appreciated on this frontal chest radiograph view.
