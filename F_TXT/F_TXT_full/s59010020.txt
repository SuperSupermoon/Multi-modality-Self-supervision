1. Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter has its tip in the outflow tract. Endotracheal tube has the tip at the thoracic inlet. There is a nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Left basilar chest tube is incompletely visualized on the current examination. 2. Bilateral layering pleural effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace disease which likely reflects compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Interval improvement in lung volumes. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in positioning, but certainly the mediastinum is stable if not slightly less wide on the current examination. No pneumothorax.
