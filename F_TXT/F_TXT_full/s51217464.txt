The tip of the ET tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina in appropriate position. An enteric tube is partially visualized. There is mild pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged and may represent a combination of atelectasis and effusion, although developing consolidation cannot be excluded. Probable small right pleural effusion is also noted. A left chest single lead AICD is in unchanged position. No pneumothorax is seen.
