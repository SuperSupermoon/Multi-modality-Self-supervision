Large scale consolidation in the right lung all worsened yesterday and has not improved. It may be accompanied by some pleural fluid. Left lung shows more vascular congestion. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is long-standing. No pneumothorax. ET tube and esophageal drainage tube are in standard positions.
