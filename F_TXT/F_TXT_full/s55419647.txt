As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient now shows a relatively extensive pleural effusion of the right lower lung, combined to an area of parenchymal consolidation located at the level of the cardiophrenic angle. The process is highly suspicious for a pneumonia, complicated by pleural effusion. Overall low lung volumes. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pulmonary edema or left-sided lung parenchymal abnormalities.
