The heart is mild to moderately enlarged. The aortic arch is partly calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. There is no cephalization of pulmonary vascularity. Upper lung fields appear clear. There is a fine reticular abnormality which is fairly widespread in both visualized lower lobes and suggestive of a more chronic abnormality such as underlying interstitial lung disease or extensive scarring. An acute abnormality is felt more likely. Correlation to prior films could be helpful, if clinically indicated, to investigate further.
