Right-sided chest tube is unchanged in position. A cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no focal consolidation or pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Previously seen left apical pneumothorax is not seen on the current study, however the linear interface in the medial left lower lung with adjacent opacification may represent air adjacent to atelectatic lung parenchyma.
