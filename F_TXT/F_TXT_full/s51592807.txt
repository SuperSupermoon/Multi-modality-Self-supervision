Lung volumes are lower than on the prior study with volume loss in both lower lobes and bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Underlying infectious infiltrate in the lower lobes cannot be excluded. Compared to the prior study, the pulmonary appearance in the lower lobes is worsened. Right-sided PICC line tip is in the SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
