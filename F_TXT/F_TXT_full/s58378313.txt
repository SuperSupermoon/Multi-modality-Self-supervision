Frontal portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which accentuate bronchovascular markings. Moderate pulmonary edema appears progressed from prior exam. Left costophrenic angle is obscured, suggestive of a small pleural effusion. Left hemidiaphragm is poorly visualized due to a lung base opacity. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly is slightly increased from the prior study. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
