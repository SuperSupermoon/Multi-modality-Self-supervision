Two chest tubes are in place in the left hemithorax, with a small, partially loculated left pleural effusion and adjacent left basilar atelectasis and/or consolidation. Within the right hemithorax, a confluent area of opacity in the right infrahilar region has worsened in the interval and may reflect atelectasis with or without co-existing pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion is new.
