AP chest compared to ___: Slight increase in opacification at the base of the left lung could be consolidation, but I think it is more likely a small left pleural effusion, increased since ___. Mediastinal vascular engorgement has increased and there is new mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Nevertheless heart size is normal. ET tube ends at the thoracic inlet as before. A new probe projects over the midline at the level of the carina, presumably in the esophagus, requiring clinical correlation. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
