AP chest compared to ___: Mediastinal vascular engorgement is more pronounced, and there may be very early interstitial edema. Moderate cardiomegaly is exaggerated by AP positioning and low lung volumes. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. No pneumonia. Deflection of the trachea is due to imaging at relative low lung volume.
