The left subclavian port extends to the mid portion of the SVC. No evidence of pneumothorax. Relatively low lung volumes most likely account for the increased prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart and fullness of pulmonary vessels. Of incidental note is calcification in the region of the carotid bifurcation on the left.
