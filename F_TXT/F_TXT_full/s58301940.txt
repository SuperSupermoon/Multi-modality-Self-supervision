AP chest compared to ___, 6:22 p.m.: Newly placed endotracheal tube ends at the carina and should be withdrawn 2-3 cm for more appropriate positioning. Extensive pneumonia and/or pulmonary hemorrhage, left lung has increased substantially. New opacification in the right lower lung could be more pneumonia or atelectasis since lung volumes are generally quite low. Heart is normal size. Some left pleural effusion is presumed but hard to assess for volume. There is no contralateral mediastinal shift which would be seen with a large effusion. Left PIC line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. Upper enteric drainage tube passes into a non-distended stomach and out of view. Right upper quadrant drain, presumably biliary, noted.
