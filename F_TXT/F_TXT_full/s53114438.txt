The heart size remains moderately enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. There is perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary edema. Additionally, a moderate left pleural effusion has increased from the prior study, and a small right pleural effusion appears relatively unchanged. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect compressive atelectasis, though infection, particularly in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
