Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Right IJ catheter tip remains in the upper right atrium. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. There are low lung volumes. Cardiomegaly is stable. Widened mediastinum has improved. Small right and moderate left pleural effusions are unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Retrocardiac opacities have increased consistent with increasing atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged. Mild vascular congestion is stable.
