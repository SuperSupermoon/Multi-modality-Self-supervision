Portable frontal radiograph of the chest is limited due to patient rotation. The endotracheal tube, enteric tube and right internal jugular central venous catheter are unchanged. Left lung is clear aside from mild basilar atelectasis. The right lung base is opacified due to considerable atelectasis. Right middle lobe is not clearly visualized due to patient rotation and underlying infectious process cannot be ruled out.
