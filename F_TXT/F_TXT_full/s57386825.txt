In comparison to the prior exam, the lung volumes are low, accentuating the vascular structures. There is a hazy opacity at the right base, which given the low lung volumes, is likely atelectasis, although in the proper clinical setting, pneumonia cannot be fully excluded. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is mildly enlarged, and stable from the prior exam. Tortuosity of the aorta is unchanged. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Moderate upper thoracic dextroscoliosis is stable. Rib deformities on the right reflect old healed injuries.
