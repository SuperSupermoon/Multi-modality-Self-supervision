AP chest compared to ___ 9:53 a.m.: Left PIC line can be traced as far as the origin of the SVC, but the tip is indistinct. One would expect cardiac and aortic motion to contribute to poor definition of the tip so that does not mean that the line has been withdrawn in the interim. Lungs are clear, heart size is top normal. No pleural abnormality.
