Interval removal of the endotracheal tube, bibasilar chest tubes, right internal jugular central line, nasogastric tube, and mediastinal drains. Interval reduction in lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis. Status post median sternotomy with overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours given differences in inspiration. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No obvious pneumothorax or large effusions.
