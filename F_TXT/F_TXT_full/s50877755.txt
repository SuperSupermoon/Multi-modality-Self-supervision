The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach. Left-sided PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes are low with volume loss at the bases. There is hazy increased opacity in the retrocardiac region that could represent an infiltrate. This is slightly more prominent than on the prior studies. In addition the right hilum appears very prominent but this is felt to be projectional there is a small right lower lobe opacity that could be due to volume loss versus early infiltrate
