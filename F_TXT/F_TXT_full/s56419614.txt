Left subclavian PICC line and endotracheal tube are unchanged in position. The nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Lung volumes remain low. Patchy opacity at the right medial lung base and at the left lung base are unchanged and may reflect areas of patchy atelectasis, although aspiration or an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Hardware is again seen overlying the mid to lower cervical spine.
