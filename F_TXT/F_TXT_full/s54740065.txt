Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip has been slightly withdrawn with tip projecting over in the region of the upper SVC however curved appearance of the distal aspect of the catheter may suggest that it is approaching the azygos vein. Lung volumes remain low. Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Bibasilar atelectasis is demonstrated. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is re- demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema. Assessment of the medial lung apices is obscured by the patient's neck and chin.
