Mild pulmonary edema, pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement small to moderate left pleural effusion, borderline cardiac enlargement, and bibasilar atelectasis, severe on the left, moderate on the right all unchanged. No pneumothorax. ET tube and right subclavian line in standard placements. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
