Right internal jugular central line unchanged in position. Stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy. Improving aeration at both lung bases suggestive of resolving atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. Linear opacity in the left mid lung likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. No pneumothorax, although the mandible obscures the apices to some extent.
