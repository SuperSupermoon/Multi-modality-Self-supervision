In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the upper stomach with the side port at the level of the cavoatrial junction. Dobhoff tube tip is in the distal antrum. The patient has taken a better inspiration. Bibasilar opacification, more prominent on the left, is consistent with atelectatic changes. In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
