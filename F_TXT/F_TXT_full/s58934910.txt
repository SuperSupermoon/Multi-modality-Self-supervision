Lungs remain well expanded and clear. Heart is top-normal size. Pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature are normal aside from an generally tortuous and possibly enlarged thoracic aorta. No pleural abnormality. Finding of progressive respiratory distress in the setting of a normal chest radiograph raise the possibility of substantial pulmonary embolus.
