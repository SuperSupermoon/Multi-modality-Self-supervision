Hyperinflation is severe, consistent with emphysema and/or small airways obstruction. There could be a miniscule right apical pneumothorax. There is also mild widening of the mediastinum and poor definition of its contours in that location, perhaps with very slight focal indentation of the trachea. Small hematoma a after mediastinoscopy is not unusual. Projecting over the right second anterior rib is the suggestion a E of 3 cm wide lung lesion corresponding to the abnormality on the CT scan for interventional procedure on ___. Lungs are otherwise clear and there is no pleural effusion. Lower portion of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
