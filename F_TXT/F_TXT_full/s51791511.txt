AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs, at 9:20 a.m., a following series of chest radiographs as late as 8:09 a.m. on ___: By the time this chest radiograph was officially interpreted by the staff radiologist, at 9:20 a.m., there was subsequent radiographic documentation of partial treatment of bilateral pneumothorax. The findings on this chest radiograph were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ Dr. ___, ___ the telephone at 9:50 and 9:55 p.m., respectively. Large bilateral pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, and extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and less so right chest wall attributable to duodenal perforation. Since the pneumothorax is bilateral, there is less likelihood of mediastinal shift from hemodynamically significant positive pleural pressure. Similarly, although the diaphragm is not depressed, there is probably pneumoperitoneum or at least pneumoretroperitoneum which could temper the effects of even hemodynamically significant elevation of transpleural pressure. Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings and subsequent course of partial treatment of the pneumothoraces at 9:30 a.m. on ___, including my concern that at least the right pleural drain is substantially if not entirely extrathoracic, and that the location of the left pleural drain is dubious as well given the failure to evacuate the moderate left pneumothorax after improvement with initial placement.
