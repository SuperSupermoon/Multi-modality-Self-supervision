AP portable semi-erect chest x-ray shows stable position of tracheostomy tube; unnchanged right pectoral pacemaker with single lead following the expected course and ending in the right ventricle. Compared to prior chest x-ray, there are little changes with stable left lung base opacity due to the left lower lobe atelectasis. Linear opacities at the right lung base are minimally increased, likely due to linear atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is no pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged.
