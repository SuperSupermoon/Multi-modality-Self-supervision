AP chest compared to ___: Following insertion of the right pigtail drainage catheter at the base of the right hemithorax, the right lung abscess is substantially smaller. I can tell on this frontal radiograph how much residual pleural fluid there is. Consolidation at the base of the left lung, developing suddenly on ___, is largely atelectasis, but CT scanning showed extensive dissemination of infection. Prior to tube placement, some of the residual abnormality at the left base is probably another focus of pneumonia. Pulmonary vasculature is generally engorged, there may be mild edema in the right lung, none appreciable on the left. No pneumothorax on either side and no appreciable pleural effusion on the left. The heart is mildly enlarged, but unchanged.
