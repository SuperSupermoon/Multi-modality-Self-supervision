AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 11:46 a.m.: Despite a right basal pleural catheter, moderate right pleural effusion has increased. Moderate left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis are stable. Asymmetric pulmonary edema previously more severe in the left lung has virtually cleared, and diameter of the cardiomediastinal silhouette has decreased to normal. There is no mediastinal vascular engorgement to suggest hemodynamic compromise from any pleural effusion still present. Small right apical pneumothorax has decreased over the past nine hours. A right supraclavicular line ends in the right atrium. Stomach is at least moderately distended with air and fluid, as before.
