A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends 2 cm above the carina and could be pulled back to avoid bronchial intubation. The nasogastric tube follows the expected course, although the tip is not visualized. There are diffuse bilateral opacities, which may be due to pulmonary edema but underlying infection cannot be excluded. The heart is upper limits of normal in size. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax on this supine view. No displaced rib fracture is seen.
