Semi-erect portable chest radiograph demonstrates several median sternotomy wires which appear intact. Surgical clips project over the left mediastinal border. An aortic valve prosthesis is noted. Progressed relative to prior examination are bilateral patchy opacities predominantly in a perihilar and lower lobe distribution most consistent with moderate to severe pulmonary edema. Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles likely reflects small pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
