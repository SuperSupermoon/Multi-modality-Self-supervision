The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is similar mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, although less striking. The lungs appear clear. A feeding tube courses through the esophagus and visualized upper port of the stomach, although its more distal course is not imaged on this exam.
