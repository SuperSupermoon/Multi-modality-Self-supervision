As compared to the previous radiograph, the left chest tube has been removed. There is a constant remnant left pleural effusion with mild atelectasis at the left lung bases. No left pneumothorax. Size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be mildly enlarged and minimal pulmonary edema is still present. The region of the right lung apex is slightly denser in unchanged manner, likely caused by projection of soft tissues above this region.
