Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There are markedly low lung volumes. There is a central venous line with the distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. There is atelectasis at the lung bases. However, this is partially due to low lung volumes. There are no pneumothoraces or definite areas of consolidation.
