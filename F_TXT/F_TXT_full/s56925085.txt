In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal tube now measures approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. Again there is interval obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with pleural effusion and substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. Otherwise little change.
