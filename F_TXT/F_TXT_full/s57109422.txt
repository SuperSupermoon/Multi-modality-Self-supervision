Lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal. Tip of the new right pectoral subclavian infusion port catheter can be traced as far as the right atrium, and although the the tip is indistinct, it is approximately 8.5 cm below the carina, or 4 cm below the estimated location of the superior cavoatrial junction. Before repositioning the catheter however I would recommend conventional chest radiographs be performed and shown to radiologist before the patient leaves the department. Lungs are well expanded and clear. Small right pleural effusion may be present. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Nasogastric drainage tube passes at least as far as the gastroesophageal junction but I cannot tell if it extends into the nondistended stomach. That also would be easier to determine on conventional radiographs.
