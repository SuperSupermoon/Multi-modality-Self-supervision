Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. There is an area of increased opacification at the left base, likely representing a combination of pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. The right lung is essentially clear. There is an area of increased opacification in the left mid lung zone, an area of presumed lung biopsy. There is a small left-sided apical pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
