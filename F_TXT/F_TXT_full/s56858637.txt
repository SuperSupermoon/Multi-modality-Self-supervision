In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a right IJ catheter that extends to just below the midportion of the SVC and a a nasogastric tube that extends only to the distal esophagus. No evidence of post procedure pneumothorax. There has been the development of increased opacification at the left base, most likely reflecting volume loss and streaks of atelectasis in the left lower lobe. ___, MD
