Soft tissues of the neck overlie the bilateral lung apices, limiting evaluation. The lung volumes are low, which accentuates the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Within these limitations, there is blunting of the right costophrenic angle compatible with a small right pleural effusion. The left lung base is opacified, which may represent atelectasis; however, a consolidation is not excluded. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but likely stable. The mediastinal contours are prominent, related in part to unfolding of the thoracic aorta. No acute osseous abnormality is detected. The bones are diffusely demineralized. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema.
