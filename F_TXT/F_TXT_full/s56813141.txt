A left-sided chest tube and left volume loss is unchanged. there continues to be a large amount of left-sided subcutaneous emphysema. There is a probable small left inferior pneumothorax given the sharp border of the left hemidiaphragm. there is increased opacity projecting over the left mid lung likely due to volume loss/infiltrate in the region. There is also some increased opacity at the right base medially that could represent an interval and evolving infiltrate. Otherwise the right lung is clear.
