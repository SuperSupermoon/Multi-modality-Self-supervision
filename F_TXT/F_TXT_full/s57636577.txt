AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed with the next preceding similar study obtained nine hours earlier during the same day. Position of tracheostomy cannula and previously described right-sided PICC line completely unchanged. Heart size remains normal and unremarkable appearance of thoracic aorta. No increased widening of superior mediastinal structures. No evidence of apical pneumothorax or local hematoma formation. Lungs remain well aerated bilaterally. Previously described mostly linear bibasilar opacities appear stable and do not show any significant interval change.
