Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the main pulmonary artery. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Mild pulmonary edema has minimally improved. Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has increased consistent with increasing atelectasis. Bilateral effusions, larger on the left side, are probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.
