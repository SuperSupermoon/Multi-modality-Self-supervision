The patient is reportedly status post prior right lower lobe resection as well as radiation therapy. There remains marked volume loss in the right hemithorax, as well as a large gas and fluid collection occupying the upper right hemithorax.

Known left lung nodules have been more fully characterized by recent CT ___ ___.
