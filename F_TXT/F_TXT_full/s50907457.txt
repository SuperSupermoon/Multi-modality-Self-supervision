Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by low lung volumes. The aorta is tortuous. Widened mediastinum is due to engorged vessels. Mild vascular congestion has improved. Small right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions are stable. Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side, have improved consistent with improving atelectasis. ET tube is seen in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper-to-mid SVC. There are no new lung abnormalities.
