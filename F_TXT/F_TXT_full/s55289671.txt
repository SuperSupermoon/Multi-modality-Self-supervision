As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Diffuse bilateral reticular nodular opacities with air bronchograms and retrocardiac atelectasis. Simultaneously, no larger pleural effusions are seen and the size of the cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits. This combination of findings favors edema over pneumonia. No pneumothorax. No new opacities.
