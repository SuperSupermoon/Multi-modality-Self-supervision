AP chest compared to the earliest post-operative radiograph on ___: Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has developed, accompanied by small right pleural effusion and persistent mediastinal vascular engorgement. Previous mild pulmonary edema has re-distributed, and there is new left lower lobe atelectasis. Overall, findings are consistent with cardiac decompensation, not intrathoracic bleeding of any kind. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube, nasogastric tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, and midline drains are all in standard placements.
