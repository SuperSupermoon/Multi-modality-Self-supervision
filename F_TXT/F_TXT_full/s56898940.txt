AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Status post sternotomy and recent aortic valve replacement. Metallic structures of porcine valve prosthesis can be identified within the central portion of the heart shadow. Moderate cardiac enlargement persists but the pulmonary vasculature is not congested.

When comparison is made with the next previous examination the amount of pleural effusion has increased significantly. For better assessment of fluid amount an additional lateral view could be useful as the fluid appears to be layering partially in the posterior compartments. ___ was paged at 1:15 p.m.
