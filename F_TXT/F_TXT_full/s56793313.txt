Pediatric sternal wires are present. A prosthetic cardiac valve is unchanged in configuration. The heart size is top-normal. The aortic arch is moderately calcified. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The central pulmonary vessels are prominent, without edema or congestion. There persistent left retrocardiac opacity is again seen, slightly more exaggerated on the current examination due to lower lung volumes, likely reflecting atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.
