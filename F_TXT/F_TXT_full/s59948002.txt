Lung volumes are slightly lower compared to the prior exam. Slightly asymmetric increased opacity in the right infrahilar region could reflect bronchovascular crowding and atelectasis but an early bronchopneumonia cannot be excluded, particularly in the setting of prior CT showing an opacity in the right lower lobe. No effusion, edema, or pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinum is not widened. Aortic knob calcifications are unchanged. No acute osseous abnormality.
