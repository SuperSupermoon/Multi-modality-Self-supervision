As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient remains intubated. Low lung volumes. The opacities, likely atelectatic in origin, at the right lung bases are unchanged. Also unchanged is the minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small right pleural effusion. No overt pulmonary edema. No pathologic changes in the left lung. Unchanged appearance of the mediastinum and the cardiac silhouette.
