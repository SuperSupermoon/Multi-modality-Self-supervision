The patient is rotated. Probably overall not a significant interval change when accounting for differences in patient position and imaging technique. Slightly hazy opacification of the lower lungs bilaterally is likely secondary to dependent small pleural effusions on this semi erect film. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly persists and is overall unchanged. Pulmonary vascular congestion is probably also overall unchanged. Pulmonary edema is minimal if any, and likely dependent if present. No pneumothorax.
