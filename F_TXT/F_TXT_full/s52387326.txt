In comparison with the study of ___, obliquity of the patient somewhat obscures detail. The monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. No evidence of post-procedure pneumothorax. Hazy opacification of the lower left hemithorax with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. The right hemidiaphragm is less sharp, suggesting some pleural fluid and atelectatic changes on this side as well. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Given the changes in the bases and obliquity of the patient, it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
