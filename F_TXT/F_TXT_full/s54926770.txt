As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. A pseudocavitary lesion in the right lower lobe can no longer be seen with confidence. However, relatively extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting a combination of edema and pneumonia, still present. Moderate cardiomegaly. No larger pleural effusions. Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
