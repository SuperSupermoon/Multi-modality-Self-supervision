CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2.2 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A right IJ central line is present, tip at SVC/RA junction. Compared with ___ at 12:48 p.m. and allowing for technical differences, no significant change is detected. Again seen is upper zone redistribution, with considerable opacification of both lungs. There are probable bilateral layering pleural effusions, relatively large on the left, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but stable. No pneumothorax is detected.
