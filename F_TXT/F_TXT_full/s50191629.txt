There is moderate cardiomegaly which appears to have increased in size compared to the prior exam. There appears to be increased pulmonary vascular engorgement as well as diffuse bilateral mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. There is a new small left pleural effusion. However, the small layering right pleural effusion has appeared to redistributed compared to the prior exam with interval increase in opacification over the mid right lung. There is no pneumothorax. Persistent retrocardiac opacification is identified and likely secondary to atelectasis.
