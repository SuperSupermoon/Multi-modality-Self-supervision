As compared to the previous radiograph, the malpositioned Dobbhoff catheter has been removed from the right bronchial system. The tube, however, is still malpositioned and is now kinking in the mid-to-lower esophagus. New attempt of repositioning needs to be undertaken. No evidence of complications. Minimal right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
