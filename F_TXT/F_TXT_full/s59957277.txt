Right infrahilar and lower lobe streaky opacities with air bronchograms are most likely atelectasis, with associated slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, as also noted on the prior chest radiograph and CT. Streaky opacities at the left lung base are less prominent but also likely represent atelectasis, also noted previously. Large retrocardiac opacity with scattered focal areas of rounded lucencies are most consistent with the known large hiatal hernia containing loops of bowel and mesenteric fat, best appreciated on recent CT, and perhaps slightly increased from the prior exam. No definite focal consolidation to suggest a focal pneumonia. No edema. The heart size is difficult to accurately assess on this AP view, also in the setting of large hiatal hernia. Aortic knob calcifications are moderate, overall unchanged. No pneumothorax. No evidence of acute osseous abnormality on these non-dedicated images. Degenerative changes in both shoulders are noted.
