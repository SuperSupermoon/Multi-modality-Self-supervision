AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Evaluation of the lung bases is slightly suboptimal due to underpenetration, particularly at the left costophrenic angle due to patient body habitus, as was also the case on the prior study. Given this, no focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
