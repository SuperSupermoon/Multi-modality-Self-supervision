A confluent area of consolidation is present in the right infrahilar region, consistent with pneumonia in the setting of cough and fever. This is likely predominantly located in the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe, but a component of right middle lobe involvement is possible given the lack of sharpness of the right heart border. Cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise within normal limits for technique. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
