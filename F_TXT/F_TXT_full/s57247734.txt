Small right pleural effusion may be reaccumulating gradually, basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter still in place. No pneumothorax. Greater opacification in the right lower lung is probably pulmonary edema, although previous consolidation in the left lower lobe has been severe enough at times to be read as pneumonia. Heart is not enlarged and mediastinal veins are not dilated. Right internal jugular catheter ends in the right atrium. ET tube tip in standard placement. Transesophageal drainage tube passes into anondistended stomach and out of view.
