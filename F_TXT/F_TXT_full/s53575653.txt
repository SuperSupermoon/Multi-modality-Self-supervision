Single AP view of the chest was obtained. Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities, most prominent in the lower lung regions, are consistent with alveolar edema. However, underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no pneumothorax or bony abnormality. There is no free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
