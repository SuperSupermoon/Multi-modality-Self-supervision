A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. There is bibasilar atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is normal allowing for lung volumes. Heart size is upper limits of normal. The dual-chamber pacemaker leads end in the expected locations of the right atrium and right ventricle. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
