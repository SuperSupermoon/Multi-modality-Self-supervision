AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained on ___ at 5:00 p.m. The ET tube continues to be highly positioned and should be advanced at least 2 cm (currently above the clavicular head, 9 cm above the carina). Right basal atelectasis is noted, but no progression of infection is seen. The rest of the findings are unchanged.
