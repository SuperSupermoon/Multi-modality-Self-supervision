AP portable upright view of the chest. Midline sternotomy wires, AICD and prosthetic cardiac valve again noted. There has been interval removal of the right IJ central venous catheter. A short metallic stent projects over the mediastinum which corresponds to a stent within the proximal left subclavian artery. Patient's chin obscures the superior mediastinum. There is suboptimal inspiratory effort which limits assessment. There is mild pulmonary edema with hilar congestion noted. No large effusion can be seen. No large pneumothorax. No convincing signs of pneumonia. Heart size cannot be assessed. Mediastinal contour appears grossly unchanged. Bony structures are intact.
