In the right upper lobe there is an irregularly shaped pulmonary nodule measuring 1.5 x 1.1 cm, with subtle high-density regions, and centrally low density. Hyperlucency at the left lung apex could represent a bulla or severe emphysematous change. Diffuse interstitial opacities are likely in keeping with underlying parenchymal disease. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
