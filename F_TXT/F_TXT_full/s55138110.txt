Leftward deviation of the upper trachea suggests enlarged right thyroid lobe. Increased central pulmonary vasculature, interstitial markings, and small bilateral pleural effusions. In setting of stable cardiomegaly, findings are most suggestive of pulmonary edema. Dense opacification in the retrocardiac space is likely atelectasis. High-riding right humeral head suggests chronic rotator cuff injury with secondary osteoarthritic changes including humeral osteophyte formation, subchondral cysts and sclerosis of the acromion. Angulation of the right lateral ribs suggests trauma, likely remote.
