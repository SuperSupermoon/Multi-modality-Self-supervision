Single AP view of the chest. Low lung volumes again seen. Interstitial opacities appear more conspicuous on the current exam which could be due to component of lower lung volumes and technique however superimposed component of interstitial edema is suspected. There is no confluent consolidation. The cardiac silhouette appears slightly enlarged compared to prior but some of this is may be due to lordotic positioning. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.
