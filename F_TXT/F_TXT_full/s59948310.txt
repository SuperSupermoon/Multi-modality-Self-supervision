In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. There is increased indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, suggesting elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Although the image is somewhat degraded by respiratory movement, there is the suggestion of an area of increased opacification at the right base medially that would be worrisome for supervening pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base.
