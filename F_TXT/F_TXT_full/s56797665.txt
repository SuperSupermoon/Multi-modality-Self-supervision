AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. On the present examination, the diaphragmatic contours are high positioned indicating poor inspirational effort in this patient apparently status post recent abdominal intervention. The lower lobe pulmonary vasculature is markedly crowded on the left base, a linear density suggests a plate atelectasis. Lateral pleural sinuses are mildly blunted suggesting the possibility of some more pleural effusion in the posterior sinuses. A lateral view, however, was not obtained. Within the accessible lung area, there is no evidence of any new discrete parenchymal infiltrate testing the presence of pneumonia. A right-sided PICC line is present and unchanged in position in comparison with the previous study. The patient may be postoperatively fluid overload; however, this has not led to any pulmonary vascular congestive pattern. No pneumothorax in the apical area.
