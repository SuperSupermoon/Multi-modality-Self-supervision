Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there is been interval placement of an LVAD in addition to bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal drains. The right apex is outside the field of view, but no obvious pneumothorax. The loculated right apical and lateral pleural effusion appears smaller in comparison to 1 day prior. Increased opacities throughout the right lung may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema or developing infection. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Left lower lobe collapse is unchanged. The remainder of the left lung is clear. Bilateral IJ central venous catheters are present, 1 of which is a Swan-Ganz catheter terminating in the proximal right pulmonary artery. An ET tube terminates 5.3 cm above the carina. An enteric tube side port projects over the proximal stomach.
