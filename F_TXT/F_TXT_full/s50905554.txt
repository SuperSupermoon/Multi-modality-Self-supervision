A portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates low inspiratory lung volumes and scattered opacities in the lower lung zones likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, significant pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinum is prominent with unfolding of the thoracic aorta and would be better evaluated with upright conventional radiography. The trachea is midline. The visualized upper abdomen is relatively gasless.
