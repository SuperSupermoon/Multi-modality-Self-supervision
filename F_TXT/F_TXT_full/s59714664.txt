The lungs are hyperexpanded and the hemidiaphragms flattened compatible with history of COPD. Large lucencies in both lungs correspond to bulla seen on CT of ___. Worsening opacity at the right base likely reflects atelectasis. Consolidations at the left base seen on recent CT of the abdomen and pelvis likely persist but are not well seen on this study. There is scarring and pleural thickening at the lung apices which is minimally worse since ___. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
