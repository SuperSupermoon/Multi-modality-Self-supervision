No acute, displaced rib fractures are evident, but portable radiographs are relatively insensitive for detecting anterior rib fractures. Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, including a left PICC that terminates in the left axilla. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Diffuse heterogeneous pulmonary opacities have slightly worsened since the recent radiograph of several hours earlier, but they remain improved compared to the earlier study from ___. Bilateral pleural effusions are again demonstrated.
