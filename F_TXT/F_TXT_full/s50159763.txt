A Dobbhoff catheter courses below the diaphragm, crosses midline, and terminates in the region of the gastroduodenal junction. There is increased opacity within the left lung base, which likely reflects increasing pleural fluid. There is increased pulmonary vascular congestion as compared to most recent prior examination, though no overt interstitial edema. Mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar to prior. There is no pneumothorax.
