The right-sided central line with the distal lead tip in the cavoatrial junction is unchanged. There are markedly low lung volumes. There are bilateral pleural effusions. There is moderate pulmonary edema, slightly worse than previous. There opacities at the lung bases which are likely due to atelectasis; however, consolidation would be difficult to exclude. There are no pneumothoraces.
