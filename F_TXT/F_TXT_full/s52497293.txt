Single frontal view of the chest redemonstrates low tip position of left PICC with tip likely in the upper right atrium, but similar as compared to prior exam. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is new pleural effusion and retrocardiac consolidation, which could represent atelectasis and/or consolidation, certainly could represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. The upper left lung and right lung are well aerated. There is no pneumothorax, florid pulmonary edema, or right pleural effusion.
