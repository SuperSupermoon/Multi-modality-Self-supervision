In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there are again low lung volumes with increasing bilateral pulmonary opacifications especially centrally. This could represent flash pulmonary edema, though there is no evidence of enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Therefore, widespread aspiration would have to be considered. Endotracheal tube is now in place with its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the distal stomach. The right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter again extends to the upper right atrium.
