A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged with the tip in the mid SVC. An endotracheal tube is borderline high at the level of the clavicles, approximately 6.5 cm from the carina, similar to the prior exam. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of field of view. Since the prior exam, the lung volumes have improved. There is persistent bibasilar atelectasis. No new opacities identified. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous and calcified, similar to prior exams. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise normal.
