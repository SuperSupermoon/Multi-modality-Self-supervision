Left-sided pacer is again noted with single lead terminating in the region of the right ventricle. Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is again noted with dense mitral annular calcifications. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications appearing most pronounced at the aortic knob. No pulmonary edema is present. Increased streaky opacities in the lung bases are noted, potentially worsening atelectasis though infection, particularly in the left lung base is not completely excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted.
