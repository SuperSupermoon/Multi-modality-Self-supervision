The patient remains intubated, with a tip of the endotracheal tube in an unchanged location, approximately 2.2 cm above the carina. A weighted feeding tube remains in place, and the tip is within the stomach. A left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is present, with the tip in the region of the mid SVC, unchanged. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain unchanged. Slight increased bilateral opacities in the lung bases are unchanged, again could represent multifocal infection, but may also represent slight edema or atelectasis. No new focal pulmonary opacities or evidence of pneumothorax. Osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
