Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the left diaphragm, with tip off the inferior borders of the film. The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and prostatic valve replacement. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. Lung volumes are low with crowding of the bronchovascular structures and probable mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm of unknown chronicity.
