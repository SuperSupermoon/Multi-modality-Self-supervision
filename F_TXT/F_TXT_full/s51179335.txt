Portable semi-erect chest radiograph is obtained. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Lungs are hyperinflated as seen previously. Increased small pleural effusion on the left. Right base and left perihilar opacifications are now more confluent with evidence of peribronchial cuffing suggesting asymmetric pulmonary edema with superimposed atelectasis. Consolidation cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax.
