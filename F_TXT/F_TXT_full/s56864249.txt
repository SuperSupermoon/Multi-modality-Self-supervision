Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval worsening of right and left parenchymal opacifications consistent with worsening fulminant multifocal pneumonia along with worsening pulmonary edema. The heart size is enlarged and is unchanged from the prior study. The right internal jugular line remains in the upper SVC and the endotracheal tube is approximately 4.5 cm above the level of the carina. An NG tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view. There has been interval removal of an esophageal temperature probe.
