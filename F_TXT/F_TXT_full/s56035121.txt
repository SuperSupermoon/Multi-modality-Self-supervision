1. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There continues to be perihilar fullness and a diffuse interstitial abnormality in both lungs, which affects the right lung more than the left, which may be slightly improved, suggesting that this represents interstitial edema. A superimposed infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. There are several deformities of right upper posterior ribs as well as a left lower posterior rib, suggestive of remote trauma. There is also an old right mid clavicular fracture. No pneumothorax is appreciated. No large effusions.
