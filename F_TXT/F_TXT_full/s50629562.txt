The patient has been extubated. NG tube and right jugular line has been removed. Moderate interstitial pulmonary edema has improved, but residual right perihilar heterogeneous opacity and left lower lung consolidation are worrisome for pneumonia. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are unremarkable. The lungs are hyperinflated in this patient with known centrilobular emphysema. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are small if any.
