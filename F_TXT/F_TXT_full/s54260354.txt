Tip of the right-sided PICC line ends in the right atrium. Consider pulling back the PICC line by approximately 6 cm which will position the tip of the PICC in the lower SVC/true cavoatrial junction. Bibasilar opacities reflecting lower lung atelectasis have minimally worsened. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged. There are no other lung opacities of concern. Top normal heart size with prominent pulmonary outflow tract from enlarged pulmonary artery is unchanged and better assessed on prior torso study dated ___.
