Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a very large hydropneumothorax on the right side. There is compression of the lung parenchyma. There is also some mediastinal shift to the left side. The left lung appears well aerated without focal consolidation, pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. The right base has increased in the size with pleural effusion, however, this may be secondary to patient positioning. There is a pleural-based catheter at the right base.
