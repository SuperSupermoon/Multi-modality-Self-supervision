AP upright portable chest radiograph was provided. Midline sternotomy wires are again noted. The right IJ sheath has been removed and there is now a right IJ TLC with its tip at the level of the cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes are quite low, which limits the evaluation. There is probable mild pulmonary edema, though overall there has been no significant change. No large pneumothorax. Heart size cannot be assessed. Bony structures appear intact. There are likely small bilateral effusions, unchanged. There are clips in the left axilla and left upper quadrant.
