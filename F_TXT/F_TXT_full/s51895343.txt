Exam is limited secondary to overlying trauma board. A right apical opacity is seen compatible with known contusions seen on subsequent CT. Trace right pneumothorax is not identified. There are multiple right-sided rib fractures also better characterized on CT scan. Left-sided rib fractures are better seen as subacute on CT scan. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for technique.
