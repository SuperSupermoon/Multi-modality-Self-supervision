AP chest compared to ___ and ___: Diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality improved between ___ and ___ but has worsened again. The simplest explanation is recurrent pulmonary edema, but if treatment for that does not yield clinical results, I would repeat the chest radiograph to see if there is another problem such as widespread interstitial pneumonia, bleeding or drug reaction. Heart is not particularly enlarged. Small pleural effusions are present. Leftward displacement of the trachea at the thoracic inlet is most commonly due to an enlarged thyroid gland, but there was none on ___ when a neck CT was performed and the appearance has not changed since ___, so it is presumably due to displacement by a tortuous innominate artery. Dr. ___ was paged at 9:30 a.m. as soon as the findings were recognized and we discussed the findings by telephone.
