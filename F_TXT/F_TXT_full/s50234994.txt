An abnormal lobular appearance of the aortic arch reflecting an aneurysm appears unchanged. The heart is again moderately enlarged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Streaky retrocardiac opacity is consistent with minor unchanged atelectasis. Irregular opacity in the right upper lobe appears unchanged. Calcifications also appear unchanged in the right lung and left apex. The chest is probably hyperinflated to some extent. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
