Air is seen in the soft tissues of the left neck. Collapse of the right upper lobe is still present, but there has been some re-expansion since the prior film of 14 hours previously. No pneumothorax is identified. The source of the soft tissue air is not determined. The position of the endotracheal tube and the other support lines and tubes appears unchanged and satisfactory.
