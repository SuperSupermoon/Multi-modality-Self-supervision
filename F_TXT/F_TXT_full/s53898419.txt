Markedly rotated positioning, which limits assessment. On the current film, the ET tube tip appears to lie above the level of the clavicular heads, similar to the prior study. Left PICC line and right IJ tube are similar prior. An NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm off the film. There are very low inspiratory volumes, with continued vascular plethora and some degree of parenchymal opacity similar to the prior film. No gross effusion identified.
