As compared to previous radiograph of ___, moderate to large right pleural effusion persists with right pigtail pleural catheter in place. Rounded lucencies overlying the otherwise homogeneous pleural fluid collection could potentially be due to a loculated hydro pneumothoraces, difficult to confirm on this semi upright projection. Right mid and lower lung atelectasis and or consolidation persists adjacent to the effusion. Left lung and pleural surfaces remain clear.
