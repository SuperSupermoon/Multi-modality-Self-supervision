As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased. There also is blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, suggesting the presence of a small pleural effusion. The patient has been extubated, and the stabilization devices in the spine and the right internal jugular vein catheter are unchanged. No overt pulmonary edema, but minimal fluid overload might be present.
