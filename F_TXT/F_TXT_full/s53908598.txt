The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. There is a moderate pleural effusion on the left with streaky retrocardiac opacity, probably compatible with associated atelectasis. However, projecting over the right lower lung, and probably in the right lower lobe, is a consolidative opacity for which pneumonia should be considered. There is no pneumothorax. A large rim calcified structure in the right upper quadrant suggests one or two large gallstones.
