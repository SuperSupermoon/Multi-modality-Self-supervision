AP chest reviewed in the absence of chest radiographs more recent than ___: Lung volumes are quite low, exaggerating the severity of what is probably a moderately severe combination of interstitial abnormality and nodular lung condition, most commonly aspiration and/or pneumonia and pulmonary edema.

Dr. ___ was paged at 5:05 p.m. as soon as the findings were recognized. I left voicemails for two other members of the careteam before I reached the patient's floor nurse who located ___, a PA on another orthopedic service, who returned my call at 5:35pm, and to whom I reported the results above.
