Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Underlying trauma board and other external artifact partially obscures the view. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No evidence of a displaced fracture is seen.
