Lung volumes are slightly low. Heart size appears mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Minimal patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases, potentially atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. No definite pneumothorax is seen, though the left apex is somewhat obscured by an oxygen face mask over this region.
