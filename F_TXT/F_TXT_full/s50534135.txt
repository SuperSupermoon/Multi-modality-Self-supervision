Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip appears to terminate at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The 2 upper most sternotomy wires are fractured, and the 2 most inferior sternotomy wires are deviated to the left of midline compared to the remainder of the sternotomy wires. Lung volumes are low. The heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinum superiorly appears somewhat widened, but this may be due to low lung volumes and supine technique. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax seen.
