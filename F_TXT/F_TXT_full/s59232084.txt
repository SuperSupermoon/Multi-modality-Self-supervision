As compared to recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, Swan-Ganz catheter remains distally positioned in the expected location of the right interlobar pulmonary artery. This could be withdrawn several cm for optimal positioning. Cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are persistent findings, and interstitial edema has slightly decreased in severity. No other relevant changes since recent study.
