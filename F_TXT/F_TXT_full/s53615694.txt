AP view of the chest. Left-sided pacemaker ends in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. Again seen is a calcified left ventricular aneurysm, not significantly unchanged. There are low lung volumes. Interstitial opacification suggests pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy bibasilar opacities suggest atelectasis and possibly small bilateral pleural effusions.
