As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 7.5 cm above the carina, the tube could be advanced by 1-2 cm. The pre-existing pleural effusions are slightly more extensive, causing retrocardiac atelectasis and a homogeneous opacity overlying the right hemithorax. Minimal fluid overload is present. No evidence of pneumonia.
