In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and right IJ catheter are unchanged. The nasogastric tube is not well seen, though it appears to extend at least to the upper stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the image. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases, quite similar to the previous study.
