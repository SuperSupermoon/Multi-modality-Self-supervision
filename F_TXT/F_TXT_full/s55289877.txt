Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. A left subclavian central line remains in place with its tip in the proximal SVC, likely abutting the lateral wall. There has been interval appearance of retrocardiac opacity with an associated effusion likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis. In addition, there is a patchy opacity at the right base with a small associated effusion suggestive of compressive atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. The heart remains enlarged. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
