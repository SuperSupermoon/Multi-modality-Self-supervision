Moderate left pleural effusion is new. Progressive consolidation in the left mid and lower lung zone has worsened, most likely due to pneumonia superimposed on longstanding left lower lobe atelectasis. Heart is normal size. Right lung is clear. New right supraclavicular dual channel dialysis catheter ends low in the SVC and in the upper right atrium. A left jugular line unchanged, ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax.
