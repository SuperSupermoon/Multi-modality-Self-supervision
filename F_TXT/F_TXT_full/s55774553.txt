AP chest compared to ___: The lungs are grossly clear, but conventional radiography is more sensitive for detection of pulmonary infection, particularly in the lower lobes, compared to bedside radiography. Upper lungs are clear, cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal and there is no indication of pleural effusion. No free subdiaphragmatic gas. Markers of chemoembolization in the liver should not be mistaken for pulmonary pathology.
