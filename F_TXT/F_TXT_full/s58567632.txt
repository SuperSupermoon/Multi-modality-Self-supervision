Portable semiupright chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs are relatively well expanded with right mid and lower lung opacities concerning for pneumonia. Mild vascular congestion and perhaps minimal edema is likely also present. Evaluation for pleural effusion is limited due to hands being over the right costophrenic angle with trace left effusion possibly present. Moderate cardiomegaly with tortuous aortic contour and post-surgical changes are noted. There is no pneumothorax.
