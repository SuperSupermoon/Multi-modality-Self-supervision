The left costophrenic angle and left chest wall are incompletely imaged. An enteric catheter courses into the left upper quadrant and crosses the midline with tip projecting over the medial right upper quadrant, likely within the distal stomach or proximal duodenum. The left subclavian catheter tip appears similarly positioned in the superior vena cava. There is slightly improved retrocardiac aeration.
