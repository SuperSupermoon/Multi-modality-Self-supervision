Since the prior radiograph performed earlier this morning, there has been interval repositioning of the nasogastric tube. However, the tip of the NG tube now terminates in the right lower lobe bronchus. The ETT terminates 2.9 cm above the carina. There is a large right, and moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette. No free air under the diaphragms.
