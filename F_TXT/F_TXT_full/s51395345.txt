The patient is rotated to the left. The endotracheal tube sits just below the clavicular heads; the carina is not well seen, and while chest radiography is not ideal to assess for such, the trachea distal to the ET tube appears narrowed. The endogastric tube side port is well below the GE junction. The left-sided central line tip in the mid SVC. The heart size is within normal limits. Mediastinal contours again demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease at the aortic knob and a large mass approximately 8.5 x 6 cm in the coronal plane dominating the right upper mediastinum (better characterized on prior CT). Right middle lobe atelectasis is new. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
