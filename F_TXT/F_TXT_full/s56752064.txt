Dense opacification along the lateral right chest wall correlates with a thick rind of calcified, irregular visceral and parietal pleura, compatible with fibrothorax related to prior TB infection. Right lower lobe opacity is new, and may represent developing infection versus edema. Left upper lobe scarring correlates with findings on the prior CT. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unremarkable. There may be a small left-sided pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax. Two stents are noted in the region of the right upper quadrant.
