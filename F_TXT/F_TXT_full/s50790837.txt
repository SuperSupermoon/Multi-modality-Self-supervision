Unchanged evidence of moderate left pleural effusion with associated pleural thickening and relatively extensive atelectasis at the left lung bases. These changes have not changed in the interval. Moderate cardiomegaly, right-sided PICC line, no abnormalities in the left lung. There currently is no evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax.
