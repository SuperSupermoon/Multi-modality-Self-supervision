Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is again seen a very tiny right apical pneumothorax. There are areas of consolidation with lucency at the right base, likely representing loculated pleural fluid. There is volume loss in the right side as well. A small left-sided pleural effusion is seen. Healed right-sided rib fractures are present. The heart size is within normal limits. Median sternotomy wires are present. Overall, there has been no appreciable change.
