AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. A status post sternotomy and the presence of surgical clips to the left of the midline is suggestive of a previous bypass surgery. There is marked cardiac enlargement. The thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated. A permanent pacer is identified in left anterior axillary position connected to a single intracavitary electrode terminating in a position compatible with the apical portion of the right ventricle. The pulmonary vasculature is distended and demonstrates significant perivascular haze predominantly on the bases. Mild blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses suggests the beginning development of pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax and no evidence of discrete local pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates. Large presence can of course not be excluded in the lung bases that are secured by the cardiac enlargement and the high positioned diaphragms. Our records do not include a previous chest examination.
