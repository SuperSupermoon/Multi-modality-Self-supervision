1. Considerable worsening of CHF findings compared with the film from yesterday evening, with interstitial and probably with some alveolar edema and suspected layering right effusion. 2. Worsening left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 3. Poor visualization of the azygos vein raises the question of a component of right heart failure in this patient with enlarged right heart border. Clinical correlation requested.
