Moderately severe pulmonary edema and mediastinal venous engorgement are new. Severe cardiomegaly is worsened. ET tube, right PIC line, nasogastric drainage tube in standard placements. Pleural effusions are presumed but not large. No pneumothorax. More severe consolidation in the left lower lobe is probably acute atelectasis.
