Combined bilateral alveolar and interstitial pattern has slightly improved compared to the previous study, and likely represents improving pulmonary edema. Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are also slightly better, and remain larger on the left than the right. There is no visible pneumothorax. Marked vascular calcifications are noted in the carotid arteries.
