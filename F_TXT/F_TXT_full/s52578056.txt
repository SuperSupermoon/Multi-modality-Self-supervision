In comparison with the study of ___, the right chest tube remains in place. There is probably a small apical pneumothorax. Opacification at the right base in the costophrenic angle is consistent with fluid in the pleural space and some atelectasis. There is opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragms, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion.
