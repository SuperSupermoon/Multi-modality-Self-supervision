1. Right subclavian Port-A-Cath continues to have its tip in the distal SVC. There continue to be diffuse bilateral parenchymal and interstitial opacities, which are likely not significantly changed, although there is some improvement in aeration. There is likely a layering left effusion. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning. Hardware is seen overlying the lower cervical spine. No pneumothorax.
