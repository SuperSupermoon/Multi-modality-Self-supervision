Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. There are extensive airspace opacities bilaterally with relative sparing of the left upper lung ___, which are new since prior study. The costophrenic angles are obscured, suggestive of trace pleural effusions. Cardiac size is difficult to discern due to adjacent pleural opacities, which is likely mildly enlarged. Right PIC catheter has been removed. No pneumothorax.
