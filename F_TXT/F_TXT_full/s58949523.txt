As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval placement of an ET and OG tube. Endotracheal tube terminates 5.9 cm above the carina. The orogastric tube is difficult to visualize, however the tip is likely in the proximal stomach. There has been interval improvement of bilateral consolidations, likely related to resolving pulmonary edema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is atelectasis at the left lung base. There is redemonstration of elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, which appears chronic in nature. Cardiomegaly is unchanged.
