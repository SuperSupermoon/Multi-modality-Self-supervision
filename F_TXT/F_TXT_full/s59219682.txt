A left apical chest tube is essentially unchanged in position. There has been interval removal of the left subclavian central venous catheter. There is a new small left apical pneumothorax. Increased retrocardiac opacification is likely due to atelectasis. Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a new small left pleural effusion. The right lung is hypoinflated, somewhat limiting evaluation. However, indistinctness of the vessels at the medial right lung base may be due to developing airspace disease.
