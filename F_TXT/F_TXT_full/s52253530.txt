AP chest radiograph As compared to the prior radiograph this radiograph demonstrates extensive progression of left upper lobe consolidation as well as slight progression of the right lower lobe opacities. The findings are concerning for aspiration or a combination of aspiration with atelectasis. Progressive development of pneumonia is a possibility. The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of low SVC. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
