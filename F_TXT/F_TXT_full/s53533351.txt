Portable AP chest radiograph is obtained with the patient in the upright position. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There is persistence of the left small-moderate pleural effusion with surrounding atelectasis. Right pleural effusion is nearly resolved. Lungs are more transparent and better aerated. No pulmonary vascular congestion and no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
