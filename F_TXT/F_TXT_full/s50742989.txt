Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.9 cm above the level of the carina. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Possible small subcentimeter calcified right base nodule may represent a calcified granuloma. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
