AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. The patient is status post bypass surgery, postoperative day #4. Findings in comparison with the next preceding similar portable study are grossly unchanged. There is, however, now a mild blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus, which was not observed on the previous examination. This is compatible with the development of a small left-sided pleural effusion. No new pulmonary abnormalities are present and no pneumothorax is identified. The previously described right-sided internal jugular approach central venous line remains unchanged and terminates overlying the SVC some 4 cm below the level of the clavicle.
