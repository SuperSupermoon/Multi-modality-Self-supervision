As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an additional esophageal device. The tip of the device projects over the distal esophagus. All other monitoring and support devices, including the endotracheal tube, are constant in appearance. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities at the left lung apex and the right lung bases have decreased in extent and severity. No pleural effusion is seen. No pneumothorax.
