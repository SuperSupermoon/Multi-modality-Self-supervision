Right chest tubes remain in place with apparent slight increase in large partially loculated right pleural effusion, accompanied by worsening opacification in the right mid and lower lung. Within the left lung, new poorly defined opacities have developed in the retrocardiac area, could potentially be due to atelectasis, aspiration, or early focus of pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
