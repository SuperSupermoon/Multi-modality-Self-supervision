In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there is a new, large, left pneumothorax with compressive atelectasis of the entire left lung. Extensive left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema has increased. Multiple left rib fractures are essentially unchanged. Pulmonary edema, better appreciated in the right lung, appears essentially unchanged. No focal consolidations or obvious effusions. An ET tube terminates 6 cm above the carina and an NG tube passes into the stomach outside the field of view.
