Bedside AP supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates worsening pulmonary edema, as well as mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement. This is particularly apparent in the left upper lung field, which was much clearer on the prior study from only five hours ago. A small left pleural effusion is stable. There is no pneumothorax. The heart size is minimally decreased from the prior study, possibly reflecting changes in mechanical ventilation parameters. An endotracheal tube terminates at least 2.3 cm above the carina with the chin in elevated position. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates appropriately in the low SVC. An orogastric tube is appropriately positioned with the side port located within the stomach. Aortic calcifications are once again noted. There is no pneumothorax.
