AP chest compared to ___: Large right pleural effusion persists despite the apical chest tube unchanged in position. Presumably, the nature of this pleural effusion is known, but if not, it should be considered hemothorax until proved otherwise. Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has developed since pleural drainage was instituted, suggesting cardiac decompensation. There could be pericardial effusion, particularly since there is no particular pulmonary vascular engorgement. Opacification at the base of the left lung is probably atelectasis, improved minimally since ___. ET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric tube ends in the mid stomach, right internal jugular line tip is at or just below the anticipated location of the superior cavoatrial junction.
