Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. Bilateral mid lung atelectasis/scarring is again seen. There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. No discrete focal consolidation is seen. No large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude on the right. There is no pneumothorax.
