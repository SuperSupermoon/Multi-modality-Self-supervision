As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. There is unchanged evidence of low lung volumes, moderate cardiomegaly, and mild fluid overload. In the interval, small bilateral pleural effusions have developed on the right. Small left pleural effusion is constant in appearance. Small areas of atelectasis are seen at both lung bases, but there is currently no evidence of pneumonia.
