The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the carina and should be withdrawn 3 cm for standard positioning. Bilateral chest tubes, mediastinal drains and an enteric tube are well positioned. A left paramedian drain is sharply angulated and should be revised if poorly functioning. Sternotomy wires are constant. Retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusions, if there were any before, have resolved. The cardiac silhouette is smaller in size and pulmonary edema has resolved after pericardial window formation. Postoperative appearance of the mediastinum is unchanged from yesterday.
