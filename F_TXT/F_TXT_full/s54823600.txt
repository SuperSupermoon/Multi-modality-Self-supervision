The heart appears enlarged given portable technique and may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Mediastinal contours appear widened, although this may be related to patient rotation on the current study. Followup imaging with a PA and lateral chest film would be recommended. Lung volumes are low with crowding of the vasculature. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. No large pneumothorax, although sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. No acute bony abnormality appreciated.
