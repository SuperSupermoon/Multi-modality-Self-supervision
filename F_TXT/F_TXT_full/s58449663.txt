Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates well expanded lungs. There is an opacification at the right lower lung zone, which likely represents aspiration, and superimposed infection cannot be excluded. The left lung is clear. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A nasogastric tube is seen with the tip terminating in the stomach and with the last sideport above the GE junction.
