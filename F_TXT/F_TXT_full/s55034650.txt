Right-sided PICC line tubing is in unchanged position. A new pigtail drain is projected over the lower border of the heart at the midline of the body. No pneumothorax is seen, however the left hemidiaphragm is now completely obscured and there is haziness in the costophrenic angle. The findings suggest some combination of lung collapse and fluid at the left base.
