A tracheostomy is in place. There is also an unchanged chest tube and on the left as well as a right subclavian central venous catheter terminating in the upper superior vena cava. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach. Bullet fragments again project over the chest. On this study there is a large new right-sided pneumothorax. The gap between the outer pleural edge and chest wall measures up to nearly 6 cm. Associated with this is new mild leftward shift suggesting tension. On the left, there is no definite persistent pneumothorax although a tiny one is possible. Increased density in the left lower lung suggests worsening atelectasis, however. There is no pleural effusion.
