Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which accentuate bronchovascular markings. Again seen is diffuse bronchial wall thickening, bronchial mucous impaction and bronchiectasis. There are superimposed somewhat confluent opacities in bilateral lung bases and right upper lobe, new since prior. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild perihilar vascular congestion is likely present. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are otherwise unchanged. Heart size is normal. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
