The cardiac silhouette size is normal. Rightward deviation of the trachea with a prominent left superior mediastinal soft tissue structure is compatible with a multinodular thyroid goiter, as seen on the prior CT of the cervical spine. Lung volumes are low. This causes crowding of bronchovascular structures. No overt pulmonary edema is present. Streaky bibasilar opacity is noted without focal consolidation. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. No displaced fractures are evident.
