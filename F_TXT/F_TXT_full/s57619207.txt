1. Right subclavian PICC line remains in place within the mid SVC. Lung volumes are somewhat diminished. There is patchy opacity at right medial lung base which may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or early pneumonia cannot be excluded. Followup imaging may be helpful. Surgical chain sutures are seen at the left apex. No pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax, although the sensitivity of detecting pneumothorax has diminished given supine technique. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
