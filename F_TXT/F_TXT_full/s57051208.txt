From the prior study on the same day, the right basilar chest tube has been removed. Another chest tube remains in good position terminating in the apex. The rightward mediastinal displacement and the right pneumothorax are unchanged from the prior study. There is no evidence of tension. There has been minimal worsening of the left basilar atelectasis and effusion which obscures the left hemidiaphragmatic contour. The left lung is otherwise clear.
