Lung volumes are low, and the patient is rotated towards the left. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for this factor. Linear left basilar atelectasis is present, but there are no focal areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia. If clinical suspicion persists, consider repeat radiograph with improved technique to more fully evaluate the lung bases.
