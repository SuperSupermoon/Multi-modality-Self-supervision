The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter is kinked and projects back on itself likely within the main pulmonary artery. Multiple mediastinal drains and a left chest tube are present. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea. A gastric tube extends into the stomach. A retrocardiac opacity is present, likely postprocedural atelectasis and a pleural effusion. No pneumothorax identified although there is a small amount of postprocedural pneumomediastinum. There are increased right perihilar opacities and vascular engorgement in keeping with pulmonary edema. A small layering right pleural effusion is also suspected.
