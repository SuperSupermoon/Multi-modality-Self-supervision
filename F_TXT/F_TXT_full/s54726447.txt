ET tube tip is approximately 6 cm above the carinal. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. NG tube tip is below the gastroesophageal junction. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is evidence of bibasal opacities, overall similar to prior study that potentially might reflect infectious process. Atelectasis would be less likely.
