Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval improvement of multifocal opacities bilaterally, most likely consistent with interval improvement of pulmonary edema. Still present opacities most likely reflect infectious process with some residual edema still present. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance. No interval development of pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
