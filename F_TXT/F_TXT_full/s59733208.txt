Small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax has minimally increased in size compared to the previous study, with chest tube remaining in place. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Heterogeneous opacities in the left lung have worsened and could reflect asymmetrical edema or developing pneumonia. Right basilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion have slightly worsened in the interval. Multiple post-traumatic skeletal injuries in the right hemithorax are again demonstrated.
