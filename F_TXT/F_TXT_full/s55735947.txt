Right lower lobe consolidation is probably similar to the recent study allowing for differences in lung volumes. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is also similar. Cardiac silhouette is normal in size. Fullness in the right lower mediastinal and hilar regions is unchanged, and widespread pulmonary nodules are similar to the recent study as well.
