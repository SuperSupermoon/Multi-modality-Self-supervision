In comparison with the study of ___, there is an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Again there is evidence of bilateral layering pleural effusions with basilar atelectasis, more prominent on the left. This makes it difficult to assess the pulmonary vascularity, though it appears mildly engorged. Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be extremely difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
