1. Interval removal of the endotracheal tube and placement of a tracheostomy tube, which has its tip at the thoracic inlet approximately 5 cm above the carina. The left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the mid SVC. There are layering bilateral effusions with stable patchy opacities, predominantly at both bases, suggestive of compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given the supine technique.Unchanged right ___ posterolateral rib fractures.
