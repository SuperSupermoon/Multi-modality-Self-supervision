Improvement in the appearance of the lungs is probably due to a decrease in both pulmonary vascular congestion and previous interstitial edema. A small concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded but need not be invoked to explain either the previous or current appearance. Heart is normal size. Small right pleural effusion unchanged.
