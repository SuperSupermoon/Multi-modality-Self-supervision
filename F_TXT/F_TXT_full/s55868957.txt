Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Right-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating in the very upper SVC. Right lung volume remains low and there is a similar configuration to the entrapped/loculated fluid in the right lung. The left lung is clear. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is subtle possible increased opacity at the left lung base, which may relate to overlying soft tissue, although an early/developing consolidation is not excluded.
