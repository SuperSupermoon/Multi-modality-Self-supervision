Bilateral lung volumes continue to remain low. There is no significant interval change in the lungs since ___. Bilateral lower lung atelectasis, left side more than right is similar. Ill-defined, coalescent opacity in the left upper lung is concerning for aspirations/infection and requires attention on followup radiograph. Endotracheal tube ends above the clavicles, approximately 5.8 cm from carina. Consider advancing ETT by 2-3 cm for adequate seating. OGT is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, its distal end is off the radiographic view. Right internal jugular line can be traced approximately up to the level of lower SVC.
