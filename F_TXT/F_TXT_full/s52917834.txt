Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable moderate cardiomegaly with central vasculature congestion and diffuse bilateral patchy opacities with a perihilar distribution, right greater than left with appearance of pulmonary edema. Opacities are greater on the right than left, which may be due to assymetric pulmonary edema, but a superimposed infectious process is not excluded. Retrocardiac opacity is likely reflection of atelectasis, edema and possibly small left pleural effusion. Minimal blunting of costophrenic angle on the right may be due to a trace right pleural effusion.
