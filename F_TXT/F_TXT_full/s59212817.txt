The patient is status post removal of a left-sided internal jugular central venous line. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is incompletely imaged, unchanged in appearance. The patient is status post tracheostomy with the tip of the tracheostomy tube terminating approximately 4.0 cm above the level of the carina. Lung volumes remain low with crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is persistent mild cardiomegaly and central pulmonary vascular congestion. Bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right, is slightly improved from prior examination. The upper lungs are grossly clear without lobar consolidation or pneumothorax. No large pleural effusion is present
