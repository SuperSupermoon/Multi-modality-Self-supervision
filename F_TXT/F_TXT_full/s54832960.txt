New left PIC line ends in the low SVC. Left jugular line tip is at the origin of the SVC. Combination of right lower lobe collapse and right pleural effusion is unchanged. Major interval development, read in conjunction with a subsequent radiograph performed at 5:21 p.m., but available at the time of this review, shows substantial increase in left pleural effusion and severe atelectasis involving nearly all of the left lung. No pneumothorax.
