In comparison with the study of ___, there again are relatively low lung volumes with prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured with streaks of opacification at the base, consistent with pleural fluid volume loss in the left lower lobe. Right hemidiaphragm is sharp with no evidence of effusion. Given the changes at the left base and absence of a lateral view, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
