AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Severe pulmonary fibrosis is longstanding. Lungs are as clear as they have been since the earliest chest radiograph on this admission when pulmonary edema was also present. Small lung nodules could be present in the lungs, but there are no large lesions. Heart size top normal, has improved since ___ when patient may also have been in pulmonary edema. Unfortunately, I cannot be sure that the interval improvement is actually due to clinical progression, since increased positive pressure ventilator support could improve the appearance the same way, without a real progress. The left PIC line probably cannulates the azygos vein, right internal jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction, ET tube is no less than 16 mm above the carina. It could be withdrawn a centimeter for more standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax.
