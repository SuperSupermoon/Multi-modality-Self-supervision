Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier. ___ tube is demonstrated. The balloon is located in the mid and distal esophagus. The tip is not visualized; is below the diaphragm distal to the GE junction. There are low lung volumes. Cardiomegaly is stable. Widened mediastinum is minimally increased. Right IJ catheter tip is in unchanged position. The tip is in the right brachiocephalic vein. There is no pneumothorax. If any there is small left pleural effusion. Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened. Left apical opacity is a combination of atelectasis and pulmonary edema. ET tube is in standard position.
