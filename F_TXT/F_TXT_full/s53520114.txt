Left-sided chest tube is new in the interval with tip overlying the medial aspect of the left lower lung field. Previously noted large left pneumothorax is markedly decreased in size with only a small apical pneumothorax now visualized. The left lung has re-expanded with streaky opacities in the left lung base likely reflective of atelectasis. Right subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates in the lower SVC. Right lung is clear. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pleural effusion. No acute osseous abnormalities visualized.
