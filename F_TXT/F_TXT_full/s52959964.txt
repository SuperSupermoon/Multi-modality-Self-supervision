An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating just below the level of the thoracic inlet 2.3 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged. Calcification at the aortic knob is again noted. There is increased opacification at the bilateral lung bases from the most recent prior study with blunting at the bilateral costophrenic angles on the left greater than the right compatible with small bilateral pleural effusions. There is pulmonary vascular congestion and edema, which is slightly increased from the most recent prior study. No pneumothorax is detected.
