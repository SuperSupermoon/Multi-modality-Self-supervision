The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette size is difficult due to the presence of a chronic, moderate-to-large left pleural effusion, which appears slightly increased in size when compared to prior study. There is persistent left basilar opacification, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. The right lung demonstrates mild atelectasis at the lung base, but is otherwise clear. No pneumothorax is identified. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. The aorta remains tortuous and calcified.
