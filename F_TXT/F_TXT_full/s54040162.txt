Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation. Tracheostomy tube remains in unchanged position as does a left-sided PICC. Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged. Linear scarring versus atelectasis is noted in the left mid lung. Opacification within the retrocardiac region may reflect an area of atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. Abnormal curvilinear lucency at the left lung base may reflect a small pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions appear relatively unchanged. Streaky atelectasis in the right lung base is present.
