Right IJ large bore catheter terminates in the lower right IJ or upper SVC. Left subclavian central catheter terminates in the upper SVC. Lung volumes remain low. Pulmonary edema is improved, now mild, and small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis remain. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
