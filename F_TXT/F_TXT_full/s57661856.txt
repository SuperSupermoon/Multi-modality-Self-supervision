The lung volumes are low, somewhat accentuating the bronchovascular structures. There is minimal left basilar atelectasis. There is no focal airspace consolidation or pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise normal. The stomach remains distended and filled with air. Overall, there is little change from the prior chest radiograph.
