AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided. Opacity projecting over the right lower lung likely represents a breast implant as seen on prior. There is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unremarkable, though the patient's rotation limits evaluation of the mediastinum. Bony structures are intact.
