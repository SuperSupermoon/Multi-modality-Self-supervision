There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Increasing opacity involving the right lung is demonstrated and may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema and atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and stable. No pneumothorax is identified.
