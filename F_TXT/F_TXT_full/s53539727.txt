Lucency at left apex likely corresponds to known hydropneumothorax more fully characterized on CT, ___. Adjacent increased lung opacity corresponds to post-ablation site and postoperative changes from left upper lobe resection. Interval improved aeration at the left base, as well as apparent slight decrease in size of left pleural effusion. In the right hemithorax, chronic collapse of right middle lobe is accompanied by near complete collapse of right lower lobe, minimally improved from recent radiograph, and accompanied by an adjacent small pleural effusion.
