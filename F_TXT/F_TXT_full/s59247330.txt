1. Endotracheal tube has its tip 5 cm above the carina. Right subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip in the mid SVC. There has been interval appearance of extensive subcutaneous emphysema. There continues to be elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with lucency beneath it likely corresponding to distended bowel. No definite pneumothorax is seen on this supine film, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. There are likely small layering effusions and bibasilar patchy opacity which may reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis. Followup imaging in the upright or semi-erect position may be helpful to exclude an underlying pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema.
