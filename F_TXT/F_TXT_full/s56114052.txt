Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___ chest radiograph. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum grossly unchanged. Bibasilar, right more than left, opacities are present and most likely represent part of the vascular engorgement/pulmonary edema but left lower lobe consolidation due to aspiration or infection cannot be excluded and should be closely followed. No pneumothorax is seen.
