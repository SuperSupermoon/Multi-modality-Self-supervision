New mild leftward mediastinal shift is not explained by any appreciable left-sided atelectasis or right pleural effusion, and probably not by the new or newly apparent barely visible, tiny right apical pneumothorax (level of the second posterolateral rib). Lungs are clear. Heart is slightly larger but still normal. Left pleural drain unchanged in position crossing the left midlung obliquely. There is no appreciable left pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Left subclavian line ends in the low SVC as before.
