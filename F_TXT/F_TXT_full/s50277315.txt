The lung volumes are somewhat low. An endotracheal tube is in place, in appropriate position, terminating 4.8 cm above level the carina. An enteric tube courses through the esophagus, below the diaphragm, and out of view. The lungs are clear, with no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or focal consolidation. Heart size is top-normal.
