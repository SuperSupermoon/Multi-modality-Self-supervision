Portable AP chest radiograph was provided. The study is slightly limited due to patient's body habitus. Opacity at the left base may be due to overlying soft tissue or atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Left shoulder arthroplasty is noted. There are no displaced fractures.
