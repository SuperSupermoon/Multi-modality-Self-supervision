1. Two left chest tubes and a single-lead left-sided pacer remain in place. There are multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with known metastases. In addition, there is more focal patchy opacity at the left base in the setting of an effusion, which may reflect compressive atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia or aspiration should be considered as this appears to be worsening. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax appreciated.
