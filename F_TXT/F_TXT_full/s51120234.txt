Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The questionable finding of pneumothorax on the prior study is no longer appreciated and was likely due to artifact/possible skin fold. No definite pneumothorax is seen on the current study. Bilateral mid to lower lung opacities are again seen without significant interval change. There are possible trace bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
