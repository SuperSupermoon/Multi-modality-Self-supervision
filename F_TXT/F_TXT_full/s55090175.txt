Portable AP direct view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior study. An endotracheal tube ends 5 cm above the carina. A Dobbhoff tube ends in the upper stomach. A right subclavian line ends in the lower superior vena cava. The right chest tube has been pulled back and has a side port located in the soft tissues. A left chest tube is obliquely oriented and all side ports are in the left hemithorax. Moderate right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Severe right lower lobe atelectasis is new. Large right parenchymal hemorrahge is relatively unchanged. The left lung is clear and there is no significant left pleural effusion or left pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinal contours are relatively unchanged. A left pectoral defibrillator and pacer are unchanged in position. Left sided subcutaneous air is relatively unchanged.
