Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There is an endotracheal tube with its tip 5 cm above the carina. A left basilar chest tube remains in place. Compared to the prior study, there is interval increase in an elliptical opacity at the apex which likely represents loculated effusion/empyema. There is also increasing opacity at the left mid and lower lung which could represent reaccumulation of additional fluid, developing pneumonia or hemorrhage. Clinical correlation is advised. The right lung remains grossly clear. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Results of this examination were communicated by phone to Dr. ___ on ___ at 11:04 a.m.
