Comparison is made to the prior study performed 9 hours earlier. Right upper lobe collapse has resolved. ET tube is in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Left lower lobe opacity has increased, consistent with increasing atelectasis. There is probably small left pleural effusion. Right lower lobe opacity is consistent with combination of atelectasis and small right pleural effusion, unchanged. There is no evident pneumothorax.
