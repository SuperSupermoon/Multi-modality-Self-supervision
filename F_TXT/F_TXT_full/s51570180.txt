Single semi upright AP portable radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes. A small left pneumothorax as identified on prior study is unchanged in extent. Bilateral lower lung zone streaky opacities is felt likely to reflect atelectasis. No large pleural through fusion is seen. Heart size is within normal limits. Low lung volumes likely results in bronchovascular crowding.
