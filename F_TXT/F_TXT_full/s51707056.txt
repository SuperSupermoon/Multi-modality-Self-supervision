Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by mild perihilar edema. More confluent areas of airspace opacity in the right mid and lower lung have slightly improved, but there has been worsening confluent opacification in the left retrocardiac region. It is uncertain whether these findings represent asymmetrical edema or edema co-existing with secondary process such as aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion is again demonstrated as well as apparent development of a small left pleural effusion.
