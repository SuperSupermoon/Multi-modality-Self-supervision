Despite the mediastinal asymmetry, greater to the left of midline, and obscuration of the aortic knob, the subsequent chest CT shows no evidence of mediastinal bleeding. Lungs are grossly clear. There is no pleural abnormality, or displaced rib fracture. Mild scoliosis, concave to the right, centered at the T9 vertebral body has no corresponding abnormality on the chest CT and loss of height in the T12 vertebral body seen on the CT scan has no corresponding finding on this chest radiograph. The CT scan is recommended for detection of chest cage trauma.
