As compared to the previous radiograph, largest portion of the left hemi thorax is still completely opacified. However, a small area of the ventilated lung parenchyma at the level of the left apex has newly appeared. The right heart border and the right lung continue to be overall unremarkable. However, there is an oval opacity in the mid right lung that could represent a small intrafissural pleural effusion. No right-sided pneumonia. No right pulmonary edema.
