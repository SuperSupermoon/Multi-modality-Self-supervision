No detectable change in the right hemi thorax. One drainage catheter projects over the right diaphragmatic region and a second more superiorly. Extensive right pleural effusion persist. No pneumothorax. Multiple pulmonary metastases, some cavitated. Heart is moderately enlarged, increased since earlier in the day and mediastinal veins appear larger as well suggesting increased intravascular volume. However there is no way to exclude the development of pericardial effusion. Clinical correlation recommended.
