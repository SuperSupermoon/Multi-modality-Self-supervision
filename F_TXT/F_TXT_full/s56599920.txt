As compared to a previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The lung volumes remain low. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with minimal fluid overload. An area of parenchymal opacities at the right lung base, consisting both of an atelectasis and of an additional opacity with subtle air bronchograms is unchanged as compared to the prior image. No new parenchymal opacities have developed in the interval. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
