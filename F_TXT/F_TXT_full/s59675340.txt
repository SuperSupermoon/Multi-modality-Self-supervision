The lungs are hyperinflated compatible with known emphysema. Nodular opacities overlying the anterior 2nd ribs bilaterally may represent sclerotic foci in the ribs or lung nodules. No other focal opacities are seen. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob are present. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
