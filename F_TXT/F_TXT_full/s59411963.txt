AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Left-sided pacer device with leads unchanged in position. There is a large-bore right-sided catheter unchanged in position, terminating in the right atrium. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Subtle streaky opacity in the left retrocardiac region is again seen, although less confluent as compared to the prior study and may represent an underlying scarring. PA and lateral views may be helpful for further evaluation.
