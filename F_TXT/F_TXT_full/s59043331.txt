ET tube terminates approximately 3.0 cm from the carina. Compared to prior, lung volumes are decreased and there is an increase in nodular interstitial opacities bilaterally, worse on the left. Moderate left pleural effusion is likely. Previously described left nodularity near the aortic knob is obscured. The heart size and mediastinum are difficult to evaluate, though likely enlarged.
