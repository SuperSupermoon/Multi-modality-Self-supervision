AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Severe but symmetric widening of the upper mediastinum, which progressed from ___ through ___, has improved. Most likely explanation is mediastinal venous engorgement, since pulmonary edema developed over the same period as well as increasing moderate left pleural effusion. On the other hand, it would be reasonable to confirm that the left internal jugular line is functioning properly and not extravasating fluid into the mediastinum. Large cardiac silhouette is partially obscured by left pleural effusion, but still at least moderately enlarged. Greater opacification in the left lower lobe is most likely atelectasis. Diameter of the tracheostomy tube is less than half that of the trachea. Clinical correlation advised. Dr. ___ was paged at 8:45 a.m., as soon as the findings were recognized.
