The nasogastric tube tip is not seen beyond the gastroesophageal junction. A right Port-A-Cath ends in the right atrium, unchanged in position. Lung volumes remain very low, similar to ___ with severe left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation. Mild pulmonary edema is improving, probably with a small left pleural effusion. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is difficult due to persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. No pneumothorax.
