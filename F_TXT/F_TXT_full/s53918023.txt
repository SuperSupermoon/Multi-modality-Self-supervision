There are bibasilar opacities, more confluent on the left than on the right with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm. These could be in part due to atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes although, particularly on the left, there may be superimposed effusion or infection. Superiorly, the lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Prosthetic valve and median sternotomy wires are noted. Left chest wall dual lead pacing device is seen. Additional catheter projects over the right chest an into the abdomen without discontinuity where seen. No displaced fractures.
