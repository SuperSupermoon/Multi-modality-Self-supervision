Lung volumes are very low, exaggerating cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vascular markings. Linear density in the right lower lung field likely represents atelectasis. The patient's chin obscures the medial portions of the lung apices. On this limited study, no pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Lower thoracic vertebra plana is chronic. Right humeral head hardware is noted. Diffuse bony mottling is likely secondary to myeloma.
