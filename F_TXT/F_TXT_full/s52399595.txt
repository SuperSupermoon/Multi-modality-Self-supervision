There is an endotracheal tube with tip in satisfactory position. A nasogastric tube is seen with tip terminating in the distal esophagus. This tip does not course below the level of the diaphragm and should be advanced. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions. There are bibasilar opacities seen which likely reflect aspiration versus pneumonia. There are perihilar opacities that reflect underlying edema. Heart size is unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum. Degenerative change within the thoracic spine that is moderate in severity is noted. There is partial visualization of a right humeral prosthesis.
