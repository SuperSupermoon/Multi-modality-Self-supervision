AP view of the chest provided. Lungs are clear. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Mediastinal and hilar structures are normal. Pleural surfaces are normal. Rounded density overlying the right hemidiaphragm is likely a nipple shadow, however conventional radiograph with nipple markers is recommended when patient is stable. Old healed fracture is noted in the lateral right fourth rib. Calcific density in the left neck is likely vascular calcifications in the internal carotid artery versus a calcified node.
