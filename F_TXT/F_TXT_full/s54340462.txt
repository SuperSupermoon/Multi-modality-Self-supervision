Patient is status post partial left upper lobeectomy with volume loss in the left lung again noted. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob. Previously demonstrated opacity within the left upper lobe adjacent to the suture lines is likely present, but better assessed on the previous CT. Aeration of the left upper lobe however does appear improved since the previous radiograph. Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Increased interstitial opacities are most pronounced the lung bases, but not substantially changed from the previous radiograph. No focal consolidation is demonstrated, and there is no pneumothorax. Previously noted small bilateral pleural effusions appear nearly resolved.
