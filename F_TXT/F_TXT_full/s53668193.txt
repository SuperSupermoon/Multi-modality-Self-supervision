Overall, there is no change in the appearance of the chest. The lungs are hyperinflated and the hemidiaphragms are flattened, consistent with COPD. Heavy pleural calcification and extensive scarring in the right lung apex with mild scarring in the left lung apex is better assessed on recent CT. Small bilateral pleural effusions on the right greater than the left are again seen. No new airspace opacity is seen. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or overt pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits with moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
