Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 2.2 cm above the level of the carinal. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the level the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image, with side port at the expected location of the proximal stomach/GE junction, and could be slightly advanced. Bibasilar retrocardiac opacities may be due to atelectasis and/or aspiration. Right lower lobe linear atelectasis/ scarring is also seen. No large pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged, likely exaggerated by supine position and AP technique. No displaced fracture is identified. There is a subtle lucency projecting over the distal left clavicle, measuring a 1.1 cm, unclear whether artifactual or a potential lytic lesion. Correlate with history of malignancy.
