Compared with the prior study, right upper zone opacity has increased, with more confluent opacification and air bronchograms. This could be somewhat accentuated by differences in technique, but nonetheless, appears increased. Consolidation at the right base and in the retrocardiac regions persists. There is minimal upper zone redistribution and likely some vascular plethora. There is a small left effusion. The possibility small right effusion cannot be excluded. NG tube present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.
