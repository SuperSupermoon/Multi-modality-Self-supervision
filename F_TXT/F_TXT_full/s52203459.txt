There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 3.8 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube is again seen, distal tip in the left upper quadrant, likely terminating at the gastric fundus. The side port is not well visualized currently. There are areas of mid-to-lower lung atelectasis bilaterally. No pneumothorax is seen. There is no focal consolidation or large pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouette are stable.
