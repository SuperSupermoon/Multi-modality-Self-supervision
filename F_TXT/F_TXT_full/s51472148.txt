A left internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the upper SVC. The left chest tube is unchanged in appearance. Spinal hardware is stable. Since the prior radiograph, the previously seen mid right lung peripheral opacification has improved, suggesting that it was likely aspiration. A large right central mid and lower lung opacity persists and looks similar to multiple prior radiographs. A moderate right pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion are unchanged. Hazy opacification at the left base is likely atelectasis, although an underlying infection cannot be excluded.
