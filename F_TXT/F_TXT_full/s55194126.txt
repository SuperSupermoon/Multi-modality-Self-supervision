As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube was removed. The patient still carries an intra-aortic balloon pump, with the tip projecting 5 mm above the upper most part of the aortic arch, as well as a right internal jugular vein catheter. The size of the cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged but no signs of pulmonary edema are present at the current time point. No pleural effusions. Minimal atelectasis at the left lung basis.
