Right chest tube remains in place. No right apical pneumothorax is seen. There continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema within the neck and right lateral chest wall soft tissues. Lung volumes remain low with patchy bibasilar opacities which favors partial lower lobe atelectasis. There is likely a small layering right effusion. The pulmonary vasculature is now less prominent suggesting that there was an element of superimposed interstitial edema on the prior study. No pulmonary edema is present at this time. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning between studies.
