The right PIC line still passes into the right jugular vein and out of view. It does not appear to have been withdrawn since the chest radiograph ___ 12:23 p.m. which was reported to show the malposition. Left lower lobe collapse is unchanged, responsible for leftward mediastinal shift. The contours of the cardiomediastinal silhouette are unchanged but little can be said about the contents. Some left pleural effusion is presumed. Small right pleural effusion unchanged, including posterior loculations. No definite pneumothorax. Left pleural drainage tubes are present at the base and the apex of the left hemithorax.
