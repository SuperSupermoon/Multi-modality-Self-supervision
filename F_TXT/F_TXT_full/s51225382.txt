Cardiac silhouette size appears moderately enlarged with a large hiatal hernia present. Diffuse calcification of the thoracic aorta is noted. There is mild to moderate pulmonary edema noted with perivascular indistinctness, upper zone vascular redistribution, and perihilar haziness. There is likely a trace right pleural effusion. Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect atelectasis. No large pneumothorax is detected. Multilevel moderate degenerative changes are seen within the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
