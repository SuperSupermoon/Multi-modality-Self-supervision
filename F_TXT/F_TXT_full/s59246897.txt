Swan-Ganz catheter has been placed via a femoral approach, with initial abrupt angulation within the right atrium, subsequently coursing into the right pulmonary artery with distal tip directed horizontally at the right hilum, likely at the junction of the right main and interlobar pulmonary arteries. Intra-aortic balloon pump is present, with radiodense tip terminating at the level of the aorticopulmonary window. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Improving perihilar edema with residual predominantly interstitial edema remaining, as well as probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
