The endotracheal tube remains in position with tip 5 cm cranial to the carina. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. A left internal jugular introducer remains at the confluence of the brachiocephalic. An upper enteric tube passes through the upper stomach and outside of the field of imaging. The cardiac silhouette remains massively enlarged but not significantly changed compared to prior study despite pericardial drainage catheter remaining in place though quite improved compared to ___. Layering right-greater-than-left pleural effusions are unchanged in volume. There is no pneumothorax. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged.
