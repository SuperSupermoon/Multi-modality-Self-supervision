As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The massive bilateral parenchymal opacities, causing volume loss of the right hemithorax, are unchanged in severity and distribution. Also unchanged is the bilateral hilar enlargement and consolidations with air inclusions at the right lung apex. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities. The presence of a small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
