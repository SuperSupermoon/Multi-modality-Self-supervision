Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, likely related to poor inspiration. There has been interval removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter. Right IJ sheath is in place. There has been interval extubation. The NG tube has been removed. There is no pneumothorax or other complications seen. The chest exam is otherwise essentially unchanged from previous imaging. There is no evidence of acute pulmonary or cardiac pathology. There are no pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
