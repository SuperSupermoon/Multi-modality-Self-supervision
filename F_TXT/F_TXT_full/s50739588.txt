There has been interval insertion of a nasogastric tube, which terminates in the stomach. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Slight interval worsening of bilateral, multifocal areas of consolidation. Apparent interval increase in size of left pleural effusion may be positional. Free intraperitoneal air is not well seen on the current study, likely secondary to changes in position. Stable, mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
