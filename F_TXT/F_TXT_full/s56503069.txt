A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained. Since yesterday, an endotracheal tube has been removed. A left internal jugular catheter remains at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and SVC. Two enteric catheters project over the stomach. The shape of a left chest tube has changed since yesterday and now has a new fold downward. A right upper quadrant drain is unchanged. Low lung volumes accentuate the lung markings. In addition, bilateral pleural effusions are similar. Fluid within the right major fissure is unchanged. There is persistent mild central pulmonary vascular congestion.
