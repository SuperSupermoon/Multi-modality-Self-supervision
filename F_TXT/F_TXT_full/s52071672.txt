In comparison with the study of ___, obliquity of the patient somewhat obscures detail. The endotracheal tube and right IJ catheter appear in good position.

In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would be impossible to exclude, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
