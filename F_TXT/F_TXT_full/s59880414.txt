Endotracheal tube tip terminates 4.7 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film. The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. There is upper zone vascular redistribution and mild perihilar haziness compatible with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy ill-defined opacities in the lung bases could reflect aspiration, atelectasis or infection. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is seen. Ossific density is seen projecting over the right acromion and distal right clavicle.
