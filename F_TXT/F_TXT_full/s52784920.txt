A rounded opacity in the left aortopulmonary window is consistent with the patient's known pseudoaneurysm, and appears unchanged from the prior radiographs. The aorta is dilated and tortuous, also unchanged. The heart size is moderately enlarged, and stable. Right basilar atelectasis or scarring is unchanged. There is no new consolidation. The previously identified mild pulmonary edema has resolved. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
