There has been interval placement of a tracheostomy. A left-sided internal jugular catheter is unchanged in position compared to the prior study. The nasogastric tube has been removed. No pneumothorax seen. The heart remains enlarged. There is persistent pulmonary vascular congestion, possibly slightly progressed on the left. Left lower lobe atelectasis. There is a residual airspace opacity at the right hilum with an air bronchogram. This may be due to alveolar pulmonary edema but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
