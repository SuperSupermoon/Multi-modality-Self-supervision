The heart is top-normal in size. The aorta is tortuous. The lungs are hyperinflated with severe emphysematous changes, as seen previously. Linear right basilar opacity is most consistent with atelectasis or chronic scarring. Patchy right apical opacity is unchanged and likely represents chronic changes as demonstrated on prior CT from ___. No new consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
