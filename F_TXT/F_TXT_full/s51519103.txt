As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a small linear structure paralleling the upper right chest wall that could mimic a pleural interface. Other than expected for a pneumothorax, however, there is no change in radiodensity beyond this linear structure. Therefore, this structure is likely reflecting an interstitial lung component, for example, the wall of a bulla. There continues to be no clear evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax. Severe hyperinflation, as previously described, persists, likely caused by severe emphysema. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumonia, no pleural effusions, no pulmonary edema.
