Overlying trauma board slightly limits assessment. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There are low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, possibly reflective of atelectasis though infection is not excluded. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is is identified. There is a suggestion of subcutaneous emphysema within the left lateral chest wall. No displaced fractures are visualized. Remote right-sided posterior rib fractures are re- demonstrated.
