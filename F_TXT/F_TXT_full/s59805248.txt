As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The monitoring and support devices, including the intra-aortic balloon pump and Swan-Ganz catheter are in unchanged position. The lung volumes have minimally increased, potentially as a result of increased ventilatory pressure. Moderate pulmonary edema persists. The left lower lobe atelectasis is also unchanged.
