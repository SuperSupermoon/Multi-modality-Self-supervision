Left and right internal jugular central venous catheters seen to terminate in the lower and mid SVC, respectively. Endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. Nephrostomy tube is again seen over the right upper abdomen. Bilateral perihilar opacities are unchanged, with still persistent mild left greater than right opacification. Right mid lung consolidation also appears unchanged. Small to moderate bilateral effusions are again seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and heart size are unchanged. No pneumothorax is seen though supine positioning limits sensitivity for detection of anteriorly collected pleural air.
