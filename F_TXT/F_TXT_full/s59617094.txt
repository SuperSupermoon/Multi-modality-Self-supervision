CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW Compared with ___ at 4:16 a.m. and ___ at 10:01 a.m. and allowing for technical differences, no gross interval change is detected. Extensive opacities in both lungs and enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette are similar to the prior film. Multiple known pulmonary and osseous metastases are more completely depicted on recent CT scans. The patient's spinal fixation hardware is again noted, grossly unremarkable. No free air is seen beneath the diaphragm. The tracheal air column is partially obscured by overlying hardware. No definite change is identified. No pneumothorax is detected.
