Endotracheal tube has been replaced or re-positioned, now terminating 4.3 cm above the carina. Cardiomediastinal contours have decreased in width, with accompanying involution of pulmonary vascular congestion. Interval improved aeration at both lung bases with residual atelectasis most marked in the left retrocardiac region. Additional focal opacity is present lateral to the aortic knob in the left upper lobe and may reflect localized atelectasis and less likely focal aspiration or developing infection. Small right pleural effusion has decreased in size but small left pleural effusion is similar to the recent radiograph.
