Orogastric tube terminates within the proximal stomach. Within the imaged portion of the abdomen, dilated loops of small bowel are present, and gas is also present within non-distended colon. These findings may relate to the previously reported history of small-bowel obstruction, and dedicated abdominal radiographs may be helpful for more complete assessment. Within the chest, note is made of extensive pulmonary metastases.
