There has been interval placement of an ET tube with tip seen 5.8 cm from the carina. Enteric tube passes below the inferior field of view, side-port past the GE junction. Right central venous catheter tip projects over the lower SVC. There is no confluent consolidation. Pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Additional catheter projects over the upper abdomen and cardiac silhouette to be correlated clinically (external?)
