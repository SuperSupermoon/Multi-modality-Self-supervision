AP chest compared to 5:08 a.m.: Nasogastric tube which was looped in the mid esophagus has been repositioned in the distal esophagus and would need to be advanced 15 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. Moderate pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly and left lower lobe atelectasis are all unchanged. Right PIC line ends in the upper-to-mid SVC. Lung apices are excluded from the examination. There is no pneumothorax on any of the other pleural margins.
