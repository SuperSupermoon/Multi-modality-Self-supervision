ET tube is been removed. The NG type tube extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film. Again seen is some form of catheter or line overlying the left upper quadrant. Skin ___ are noted in the abdomen and there are surgical clips in the right upper quadrant. Left IJ central line tip overlies the proximal SVC, there the point of confluence . Right-sided indwelling catheter tip overlies the distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly prominent, but unchanged. Hazy density at both lung bases suggests the presence of bilateral effusions, with some degree of layering. There is likely underlying collapse and/or consolidation, though much of the right hemidiaphragm remains visible. Again seen is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, consistent with mild CHF. Rounded density overlying the left lung base laterally is new compared with the most recent prior study and likely represents a nipple shadow.
