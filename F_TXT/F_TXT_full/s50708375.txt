1. Endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the carina. A left internal jugular central line has its tip unchanged in position in the proximal-to-mid SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Persistent consolidation at the right lung base which likely reflects a combination of pleural effusion and/or atelectasis/pneumonia. When compared to prior study, however, there has been interval appearance of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. A small left effusion is also likely. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged, although somewhat difficult to assess due to the superimposed airspace process.
