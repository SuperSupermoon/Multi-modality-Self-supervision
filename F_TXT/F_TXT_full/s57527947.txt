Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest was provided. Patient is rotated and right CP angle is excluded. There are vague opacities in the lower lungs which could represent aspiration. No large effusion or pneumothorax. The overall cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable, though difficult to assess given patient rotation. The bony structures appear intact with degenerative changes at the shoulders.
