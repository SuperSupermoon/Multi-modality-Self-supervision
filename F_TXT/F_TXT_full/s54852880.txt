In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside facility, there is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. This discordance raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or possibly even pericardial effusion. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is seen with some opacification in the retrocardiac region, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lung and small pleural effusion. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia. Endotracheal tube is in place with its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. The orogastric tube is very difficult to see, though it appears to extend to at least the upper stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the image. An abdomen examination could be obtained to definitely see the tip of the tube.
