In comparison with the study of ___, there is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without appreciable vascular congestion, a discordance that raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy. Pacer device is unchanged and there is a Port-A-Cath with its tip in the lower SVC. There is increased opacification at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic angle. This is consistent with small left pleural effusion and atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. Minimal blunting is seen in the right costophrenic angle.
