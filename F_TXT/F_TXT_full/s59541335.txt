A right internal jugular central venous catheter is in place with the tip terminating in the low right atrium, which should be retracted approximately 7 cm to place in the low SVC. Diffuse prominence of interstitial lung markings is unchanged from ___, compatible with pulmonary edema. There is interval increased retrocardiac opacification, which may reflect a small left pleural effusion and atelectasis or consolidation. No sizable pleural effusion is seen on the right on this AP radiograph, and there is no pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly and a calcified aorta are unchanged. No acute osseous abnormality is detected. Healed right lateral rib fractures are noted.
