There has been interval improvement in the superimposed pulmonary edema with only residual mild interstitial edema present. No pneumothorax is seen. Right-sided rib fractures with associated pleural thickening are again seen. Left basilar, and to a lesser extent, right basilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
