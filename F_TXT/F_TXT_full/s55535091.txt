In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a pigtail catheter in the left lower zone with no evidence of pneumothorax. There is some elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour, but no vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. A lateral view would be necessary to evaluate the degree of residual effusion on the left.
