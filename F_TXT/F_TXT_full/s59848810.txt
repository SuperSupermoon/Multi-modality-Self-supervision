The lung volume is small. A retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm is new compared to yesterday. This is most likely due to worsening atelectasis rather than pneumonia. The right lower lobe atelectasis has increased. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. The mediastinum is unchanged. No pleural abnormalities or pneumothorax.
