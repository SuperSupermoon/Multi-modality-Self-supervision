Left-sided AICD/pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Lungs remain hyperinflated with relative attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices compatible with emphysema. Mild pulmonary edema is new compared to the prior study with more focal bibasilar airspace opacities potentially reflecting atelectasis though infection is not excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified, with scarring noted in the lung apices. Degenerative changes are noted in both acromioclavicular joints.
