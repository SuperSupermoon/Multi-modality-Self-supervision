Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate well-expanded lungs. There is a 1.6 cm diameter round nodule in the left lower lobe which was the target of the recent biopsy. There is no pneumothorax or other complications from the biopsy seen. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pulmonary effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
