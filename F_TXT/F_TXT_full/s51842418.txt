A single portable AP view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Right IJ central venous catheter is in the mid SVC. The tip of the enteric tube is just beyond the GE junction and needs to be advanced. Pacemaker leads are appropriately positioned in the right atrium and right ventricle. There are dense diffuse bilateral interstitial and probably also alveolar opacities, including some denser opacities along the right chest wall. The appearance in the right chest may also reflct a moderate layering right effusion is present. The possibility of a small left effusion cannot be excluded. The cardiomediastinal borders are obscured by the pulomary opacities, but appears moderately enlarged.
