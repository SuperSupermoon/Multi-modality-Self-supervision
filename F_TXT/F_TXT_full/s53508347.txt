The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. A left-sided pacemaker is in place, with the leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Diffuse bilateral opacities are seen, which may be consistent with edema/hemorrhage or pneumonia/ aspiration. A right-sided pleural effusion is likely present. There is bilateral volume loss. An endotracheal tube and partially visualized transesophageal tube remain in stable position. There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube, which terminates in the left mid hemithorax. No definite large pneumothorax is identified.
