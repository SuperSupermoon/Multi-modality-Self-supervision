1. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Increasing patchy opacity at the left base which could reflect increasing atelectasis in the setting of a chronic pleural effusion, although an acute infectious process or aspiration should also be considered. Linear lucency in the region of the left lateral hemidiaphragm is felt to represent aerated lung rather than free intraperitoneal air. There is some crowding of the pulmonary vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. If the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging should be considered.
