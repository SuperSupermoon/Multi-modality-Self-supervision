Left chest tube remains in place. There has been interval decrease in size but a persistent small left apical pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low. There continues to be patchy opacity in the left mid lung that may represent an area of hemorrhage or resolving contusion. The right hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated, suggesting that there is likely atelectasis at the right base as well. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
