A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a nasogastric tube in the stomach, with the tip pointing towards the fundus. The left jugular central catheter is unchanged in position, with the tip in the mid SVC. There is slightly increased right base atelectasis and mild engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature. The exam is otherwise unchanged. Please note that the apices are excluded and cannot be evaluated.
