In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial increase in opacity in the right hemithorax, consistent with large pleural effusion. In the absence of displacement of mediastinal structures, there has been compensatory collapse in the right lung. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the left base, possibly with small effusion. Especially on the right, it is impossible to exclude the possibility of superimposed consolidation, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
