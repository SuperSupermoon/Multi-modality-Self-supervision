Mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours remain stable. Note is made of sternotomy wires and surgical clips from prior CABG. The pulmonary opacifications consistent with pulmonary edema are stable compared to yesterday. There is no new focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
