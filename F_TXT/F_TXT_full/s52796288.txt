AP chest compared to ___: Greater consolidation in the right lower lobe could represent spreading pneumonia or supervening atelectasis. Small right pleural effusion is presumed. In the meantime apparent improvement in left lower lobe consolidation is not as marked as one would think since much of the opacity previously was due to overlying tubing. This could, however, represent clearing pneumonia. Upper lungs are clear and there is no indication of cardiac decompensation. Heart size is normal. Upper lungs are clear and there is no pulmonary edema. NG tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Neural stimulators extend their leads into the neck and out of view.
