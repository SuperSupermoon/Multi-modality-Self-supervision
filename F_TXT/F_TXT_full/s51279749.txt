AP chest compared to ___: ET tube in standard placement, upper enteric tube traverses the esophagus into the upper abdomen and out of view. Moderate right pleural effusion is new or substantially increased, layering posteriorly in what is I presume a nearly supine patient. More pronounced leftward mediastinal shift could be due in part to the right pleural effusion but more likely worsening left lower lobe atelectasis. Pulmonary vasculature is more pronounced, but this may be due in part to supine positioning. Nevertheless, given moderate cardiomegaly and very large pulmonary arteries, there is evidence of biventricular heart failure, although probably not pulmonary edema. Small left pleural effusion is larger. No pneumothorax.
