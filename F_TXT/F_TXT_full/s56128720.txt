Portable AP radiograph of the chest was obtained and reviewed. The ET tube tip is 2.7 cm above the carina. Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. Lungs are essentially clear except for potential minimal bibasilar areas of atelectasis potentially related to suboptimal inspiration at this point. Excretion of the IV contrast in the collecting system is noted and most likely related to recent CT obtained with IV contrast.
