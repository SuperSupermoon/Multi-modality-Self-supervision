There are no prior studies available for comparison. There are low lung volumes. Widening of mediastinum is likely due to engorgement of the mediastinal vessels. Adenopathy cannot be totally excluded. Followup when clinically appropriate with conventional PA and lateral views is recommended. Small bilateral pleural effusions are largely on the right side. There is mild vascular congestion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by the low lung volumes.
