There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle raising concern for a small left pleural effusion. Left base streaky retrocardiac opacity may relate to pleural effusion and atelectasis although an underlying consolidation is not excluded. The right lung is clear. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
