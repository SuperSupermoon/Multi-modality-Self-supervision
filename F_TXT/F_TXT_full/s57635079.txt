Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates a vague opacification projecting over the lingula in the region of the previously noted mass. Finding is likely a combination of residual mass and a small, not unexpected hemorrhage. No pneumothorax identified. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Minimal atelectatic changes are noted in the right lung base. No osseous abnormality evident.
