A chest tube again projects along the right lower hemithorax. There is probably a small right apical pneumothorax but not well visualized. Subcutaneous emphysema appears unchanged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is no pleural effusion. Several right-sided rib fractures are better demonstrated on a recent prior CT. The right acromioclavicular joint is widened. There has been no definite change.
