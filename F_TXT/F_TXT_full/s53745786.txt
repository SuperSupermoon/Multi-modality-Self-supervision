When compared with the immediate prior study, left upper lung aeration has improved and effusion has decreased. There appears to be moderate re-expansion pulmonary edema. The right lung is unchanged, likely with a small pleural effusion. Endotracheal tube is 3.4 cm from the carotid. A left-sided PICC line ends in the mid SVC. The enteric tube passes beyond the diaphragm outside of the field of view with the decompressed stomach. There is no pneumothorax.
