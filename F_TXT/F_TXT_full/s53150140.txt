1. Right subclavian PICC line with its tip in the proximal SVC. Spinal hardware is seen overlying the upper and mid thoracic spine. A left chest tube is in place. No pneumothorax is seen. However, there is airspace opacity at the left lung base with an associated elevated left hemidiaphragm. These findings together would favor lower lobe atelectasis rather than aspiration or acute infectious process. Clinical correlation is advised. The right lung is grossly clear. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to heart border being obscured and overlying spinal hardware.
