Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.5 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm terminating expected location of the distal stomach. A right-sided subclavian catheter is stable in position. There are low lung volumes. Multifocal right-sided pulmonary opacities have increased in the interval which may be due underlying aspiration and/ or worsening multifocal pneumonia. Left mid to lower lung opacities are grossly stable to possibly very slightly increased. No large pleural effusion is seen although trace pleural effusions are difficult to exclude. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
