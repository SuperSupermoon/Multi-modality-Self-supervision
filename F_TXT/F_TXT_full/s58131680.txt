Left pleural catheter remains in place. A tiny left apical pneumothorax has appeared. There continues to be a left pleural effusion with associated airspace opacity which could reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Lungs remain hyperinflated suggesting underlying emphysema. There is mild perihilar vascular congestion but the interstitial edema has resolved. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
