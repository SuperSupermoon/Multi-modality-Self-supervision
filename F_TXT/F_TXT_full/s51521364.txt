In comparison with the study of ___, there is no evidence of pneumothorax with the left chest tube in place. Continued subcutaneous gas in the left neck and along the left lateral chest and abdominal wall. Some areas of increased opacification are seen at both bases. Although this could merely represent atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
