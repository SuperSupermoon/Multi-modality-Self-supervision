Additional history that was not provided is the patient was re-operated on the evening of ___ for postoperative persistent graft-related bleeding. Endotracheal tube position is somewhat obscured by the linear dense likely packing material Endotracheal tube appears to be 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach likely terminating in the proximal stomach. Swan-Ganz catheter is in the pulmonary outflow tract. The patient's sternal wound is open with removal of sternotomy wires. Bilateral chest tubes are new with unchanged mediastinal drains. Swan-Ganz catheter terminates just proximal to the pulmonic valve. Postoperative mediastinal widening is slightly increased from the prior compatible with repeat procedure. A trace right and small left pleural effusions are likely present along with dense left basal atelectasis.
