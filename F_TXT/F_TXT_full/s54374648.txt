AP chest compared to 12:40 a.m.: Lung volumes are appreciably lower, exaggerating heart size and pulmonary vascular caliber. Focal opacification at the base of the left lung is usually due to a combination of small pleural effusion and atelectasis. Pneumomediastinum and/or pneumopericardium have decreased. Right pneumothorax is minimal, if any. Tip of the endotracheal tube, no more than 2.5 cm above the carina, should not be advanced. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary artery. Midline drains in place. Upper enteric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
