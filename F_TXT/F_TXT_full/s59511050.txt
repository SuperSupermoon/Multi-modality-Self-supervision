The patient is Re intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above the carinal. The course of a nasogastric tube is unremarkable, the tip is not visualized on the image. The lung volumes have increased and the pre-existing diffuse parenchymal opacities have substantially decreased in extent and severity, likely as a result of intubation. A minimal right pleural effusion is present. No new focal parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
