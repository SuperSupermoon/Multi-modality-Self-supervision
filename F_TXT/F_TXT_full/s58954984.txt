The new endotracheal tube terminates 2.4 cm from the carina. Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar atelectasis. Allowing for this there is likely moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. There is a trace left pleural effusion. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. There is apparent discontinuity of the lateral left seventh and eighth ribs and the posterior left fifth rib suggesting acute fractures. Right sixth and seventh ribs also appear fractured in their lateral portion. There is diffuse demineralization.
