1. There has been interval placement of two right-sided chest tubes. Suggestion of a tiny amount of air loculated at the right apex. Lung volumes are diminished and there has been interval appearance of predominantly patchy opacity at the right base with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm suggestive of partial right lower lobe atelectasis. Few scattered patchy opacities in the left lung also likely reflect atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning and technique.
