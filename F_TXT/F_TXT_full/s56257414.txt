The patient is rotated to the right on this examination. Median sternotomy wires appear intact from prior CABG. Numerous mediastinal clips are again noted. Mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly appears unchanged. The lungs are clear. No confluent opacity is identified. There is no pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema or pleural effusions are evident. Surgical clips are again noted below the right hemidiaphragm and likely related to history of cholecystectomy as evidenced by prior CT.
