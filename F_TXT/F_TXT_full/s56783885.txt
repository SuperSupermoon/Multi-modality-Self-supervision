Frontal radiograph of the chest again demonstrates left upper mediastinal widening which is not significantly changed since the prior study. Likewise, the previously seen left pleural fluid and left basilar atelectasis are also unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Of note, the right lower lung demonstrates possible air bronchograms.
