Compared with the prior study, there is some increased opacity at the right base, but there has also been interval placement of a drainage catheter. No pneumothorax is identified. A new stent overlies the lower mediastinum, presumably in relation to the lower esophagus. An additional linear metallic density lies adjacent to the proximal edge of the stent. The left lung is grossly clear, without CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion. Mild right paratracheal soft tissue thickening is again noted unchanged and is thought to represent a prominent azygos vein.
