In comparison to the last chest radiograph performed several hours ago on the same date, there has been interval placement of an OG tube. It is seen extending distally to at least the mid/lower stomach, where it crosses the inferior margin of the image. The endotracheal tube is unchanged in position. A tubular structure with a distal coil is seen in the right side of the neck. There is a wedge-shaped opacity in the right upper lobe, which is new since today's CXR but was noted on today's CT scan. It likely represents pulmonary infarction in the setting of known pulmonary embolism, but cannot exclude superimposed aspiration. There are no large pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. No acute osseous abnormalities.
