In comparison with study of ___, there is an area of increased opacification at the right cardiophrenic angle. It is difficult to determine whether this merely reflects pulmonary vessels in a patient with low lung volumes, or whether this could represent a developing consolidation. If the condition of the patient would permit, lateral view would be most helpful. The left base is clearer than on the previous study.
