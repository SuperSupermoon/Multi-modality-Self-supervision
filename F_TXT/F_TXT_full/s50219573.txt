AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained nine hours earlier during the same day. Previously described left-sided internal jugular approach central venous line remains in unchanged position terminating in the upper SVC. Also previously identified small caliber right basal pig-tail end catheter remains in unchanged position. Left-sided chest tube has changed its position, apparently it has been pulled back so that its pigtail end now is overlying the posterolateral pleural sinus. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or new parenchymal infiltrates. The pulmonary vascular pattern is compatible with advanced congestion, a finding that existed already on the previous examination.
