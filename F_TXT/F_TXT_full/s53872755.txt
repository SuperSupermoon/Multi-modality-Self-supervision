An endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above the carina. Right central venous catheter line terminates in the right brachiocephalic vein. A left central venous catheter line terminates in the upper SVC. An enteric tube projects over the expected location of the stomach, however the tip is not included in this examination. Left pleural drain terminates in the mid-upper lung, slightly changed in position from prior examination. As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval worsening of uniform opacification of the right lower lung with associated air bronchograms. This is consistent with increasing pleural effusion secondary to atelectasis. Left peribronchial heterogeneous opacification remains, which may represent either an infectious process or aspiration. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
