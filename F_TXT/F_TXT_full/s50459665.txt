AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Heart size is at the upper limit of normal variation, but no configurational abnormality is present. Pulmonary vasculature is not congested. Thoracic aorta is somewhat prominent with calcium deposit in the wall at the level of the arch. No other mediastinal abnormalities are present. The lungs are clear bilaterally without evidence of acute pneumonic infiltrates as possibly can be identified on single view examination. Lateral pleural sinuses are free. No pneumothorax in apical area. A thin wire is overlying the left lower neck region and overlies the mediastinal structures. It most likely represents a nerve stimulation wire placed by anesthesia. Our records include a previous chest examination of ___. Existed a small basal plate atelectasis on the left side, but this has normalized.
