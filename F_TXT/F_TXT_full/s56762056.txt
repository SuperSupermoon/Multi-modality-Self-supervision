Lung volumes remain low. This results in crowding of bronchovascular structures. No gross areas of consolidation are identified, and there are no definite pleural effusions, although exclusion of left lateral costophrenic sulcus from the radiograph limits this assessment. Feeding tube remains in place, with tip terminating in the proximal stomach just beyond the GE junction level.
