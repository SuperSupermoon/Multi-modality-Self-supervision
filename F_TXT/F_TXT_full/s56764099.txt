1. Right subclavian PICC line terminates in the proximal SVC. A nasogastric tube is coiled within the stomach. There is persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with adjacent airspace opacity which does not appear to be significantly changed and most likely reflects lobar atelectasis with an accompanying small layering effusion. An acute infectious process and/or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. Right lung remains grossly clear. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. The heart remains enlarged. There is a persistent right medial lung base opacity which also may represent an area of patchy atelectasis, although an acute infectious process cannot be excluded. Visualized left upper lung is clear. No pneumothorax. Heart is stably enlarged.
