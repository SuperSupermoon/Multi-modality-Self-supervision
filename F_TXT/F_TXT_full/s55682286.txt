Again a catheter seen terminating in the right axilla, possibly a midline vascular access catheter, unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study. There are persistent bilateral perihilar airspace opacities with prominence of the upper lobe vasculature consistent with pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular congestion. The extent is similar when compared to the prior study. Silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe atelectasis. Probable bilateral pleural effusions poorly visualized on this semi-erect AP view. No pneumothorax seen.
