Right-sided Port-A-Cath remains in place with tip in the distal SVC. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Linear opacity at the left base most likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. No focal airspace consolidation seen to suggest pneumonia. No pleural effusions or pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
