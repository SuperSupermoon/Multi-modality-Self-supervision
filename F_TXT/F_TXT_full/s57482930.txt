There is interval improvement in lung volumes, which still remain slightly low. This results in improvement of the widening of the cardiac silhouette, which is still mildly enlarged. Left lower lobe consolidation persists, and may represent a combination of effusion and atelectasis, with underlying infection is not excluded. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Right perihilar consolidation most likely represents atypical edema given waxing and waning nature over time, but pneumonia remains a possibility. Left internal jugular line terminates at the junction with the SVC. NG and ET tubes are in standard positions.
