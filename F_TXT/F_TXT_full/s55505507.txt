In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the nasogastric tube has been pushed forward so that the tip lies well into the stomach with the side hole distal to the esophagogastric junction. Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2 cm above the carina. Consideration could be given to pulling this back somewhat, since the study was obtained with the chin of the patient elevated. Extensive opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe plus a small effusion. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
