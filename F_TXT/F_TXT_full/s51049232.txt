The heart is mild to moderately enlarged. There are patchy opacities in the lower lungs including a suspected small pleural effusion on the right. Although infection cannot be excluded, right basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis associated with a pleural effusion. The pulmonary vascularity is mildly prominent with upper zone redistribution, although without frank edema. There is no pneumothorax.
