Lordotic positioning. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged. Nonvisualization of the cardiac apex most likely reflects the presence of a cardiac fat pad. Aorta is minimally unfolded. Right paratracheal soft tissue density is noted, but likely reflects vascular structures. There is equivocal minimal upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. There mild retrocardiac atelectasis. No focal consolidation or effusion is identified. No pneumothorax detected. Small focus of hydroxyapatite it is seen adjacent to the left shoulder, consistent with calcific tendinitis, of indeterminate acuity.
