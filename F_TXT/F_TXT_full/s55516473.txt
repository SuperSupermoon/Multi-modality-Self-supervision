Supine supine positioning and low lung volumes exaggerate mild cardiomegaly, and pronounced distension of pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature indicating cardiac decompensation and/or volume overload. There is no pulmonary edema or definite pleural abnormality. Thoracic aorta is large, but cannot be fully evaluated on this study. Tip of the endotracheal tube is in standard position. Fluid is pooling above the inflated cuff.
