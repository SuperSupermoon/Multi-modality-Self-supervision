1. Right subclavian PICC line remains unchanged in position. Lung volumes remain relatively low and there is decreased aeration at the right base which may reflect an enlarging right pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe. Persistent consolidation at the left base with an associated effusion is also identified. There continues to be mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the bilateral airspace process.
