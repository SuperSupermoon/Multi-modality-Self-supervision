Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ at 01:04. Volume of previous substantial left pneumothorax has decreased following insertion of the left pigtail pleural drainage catheter. There is probably a small residual paramediastinal and perhaps a tiny left apical component. There is no appreciable left pleural effusion. Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis is stable. Right lower lobe atelectasis has worsened substantially, perhaps lobar collapse. Skin fold projecting over the right chest laterally should not be mistaken for a right pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Left PIC line ends in the low SVC. Tracheostomy tube midline.
