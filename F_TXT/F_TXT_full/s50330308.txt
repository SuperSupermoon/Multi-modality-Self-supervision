There is a tiny right apical pneumothorax, which has decreased in size since the previous study. The right IJ line has its distal lead tip in the distal SVC, unchanged. Heart size is within normal limits. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion, unchanged. The rest of the lung fields are grossly clear.
