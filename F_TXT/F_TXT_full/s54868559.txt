The right lung apex and upper mediastinum are obscured by the patient's head and neck. Allowing for this, no gross change is identified. Again seen is cardiomegaly with a dual lead pacemaker and patchy opacity at the right lung base, with minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, similar to the prior study. As before, the right hemidiaphragm appears elevated. Also again seen is atelectasis at the left lung base. No left no gross left effusion. Upper zone redistribution again noted. Doubt overt CHF.
