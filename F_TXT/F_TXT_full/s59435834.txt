Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is asymmetric pleural thickening at the right lung apex, with apparent retraction of the minor fissure. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is probably very slight upper zone redistribution, but I doubt overt CHF. Possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which is not clearly changed. No focal consolidation or gross effusion is identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is borderline enlarged with a calcified slightly unfolded aorta, but is unchanged. Incidental note is made of a probable large subchondral cyst in the left glenoid.
