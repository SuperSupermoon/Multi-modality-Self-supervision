In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the nasogastric tube is been pushed forward so that the side port is distal to the esophagogastric junction. Endotracheal tube tip remains in good position. There is increasing opacification at the left base consistent with volume loss left lower lobe and pleural fluid. Little change in the mild atelectatic findings at the right base.
