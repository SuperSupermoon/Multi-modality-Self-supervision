Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the day earlier. The ET tube tip is 4.2 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach with the sidehole being above the gastroesophageal junction and should be further advanced. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged as well as there is no change in the left lower lobe atelectasis and left pleural effusion.
