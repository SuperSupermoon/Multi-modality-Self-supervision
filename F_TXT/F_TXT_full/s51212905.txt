AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Moderate cardiac enlargement as before. During the latest interval, a right internal jugular approach wide-caliber central venous line has been placed, seen to reach the lower SVC just short of entering into the right atrium. The previously described diffuse pulmonary parenchymal densities in the entire right hemithorax are still present and have not changed significantly. Observe that the lateral pleural sinuses are free which speaks against significant pleural effusion. The left hemithorax pulmonary parenchymal densities are more marked in the upper lobe area resulting now in a rather discrete infiltrate of pneumonic character in this area. This density appears to have progressed moderately since the next preceding examination. The left lower lobe area and the retrocardiac space remain relatively free, and again there is no evidence of pleural effusion in the lateral pleural sinus. No pneumothorax is seen.
