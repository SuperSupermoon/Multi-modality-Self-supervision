Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube. Slight decrease in width of cardiomediastinal contours, and continued improvement in pulmonary edema. Bibasilar predominantly retrocardiac opacities have slightly worsened, and may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration and infectious pneumonia are additional considerations. Small left pleural effusion is noted.
