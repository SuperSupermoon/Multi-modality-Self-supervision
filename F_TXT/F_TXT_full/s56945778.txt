2 new right pleural drains are in place. One takes an unusual looping course in the mid and lower hemithorax, and the other crosses the mid chest obliquely. Precise localization would require at least a lateral view or chest CT scanning. Small right pleural effusion is smaller today than on ___, but not resolved. There is no pneumothorax, but there is new subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall. Diffuse interstitial pulmonary abnormality is long-standing, making it difficult to assess the presence of interstitial edema, but some edema views likely. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Pleural thickening extending into the right inter lobar fissures makes it difficult to exclude discrete lung lesions in that region. Tracheostomy tube is midline. The caliber of the tube is smaller than usually seen in should be evaluated clinically.
