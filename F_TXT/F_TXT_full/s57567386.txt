Since the prior radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. Lung volumes are increased with relative flattening of the hemidiaphragms, likely due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as recent CT neck documented the presence of emphysema at the lung apices. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for rotation apparently related to scoliosis. Patchy and linear opacities are present at the right lung base, accompanied by volume loss with inferior displacement of the minor fissure. The radiographic appearance favors atelectasis, but aspiration and infectious pneumonia could produce a similar appearance in the appropriate clinical setting. Followup PA and lateral radiographs may be helpful in this regard when the patient's condition permits. At that time, the costophrenic angles can be reassessed to determinate whether there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
