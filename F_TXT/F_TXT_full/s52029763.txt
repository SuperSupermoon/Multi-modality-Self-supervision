The Dobbhoff tube tip has migrated more proximally since previous and is just within the fundus of the stomach, approximately 2 cm beyond the GE junction. This is in satisfactory position for use however it could be advanced a few more cm for more optimal placement. There is a right sided central line with the distal lead tip in the proximal SVC. Heart size is within normal limits. There are no pneumothoraces. Lungs are grossly clear.
