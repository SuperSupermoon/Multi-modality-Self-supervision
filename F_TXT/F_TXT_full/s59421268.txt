Leftward mediastinal shift accompanying left lower lobe consolidation is exaggerated by mild patient rotation, but the combination suggests left lower lobe "pneumonia" may be chronic atelectasis instead.

It would be helpful to obtain conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs if for no other reason and to compare to a similar study performed here on ___.
