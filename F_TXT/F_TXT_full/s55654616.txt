The endotracheal tube tip remains low lying, terminating approximately 2.4 cm from the carina. An enteric tube remains in unchanged position. Left sided chest tube remains with associated subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral chest wall, with previously noted kinking of the distal aspect of the tube now resolved. Known small left pneumothorax appears grossly unchanged. Aeration of the left lung base also appears slightly improved reflecting day combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion. Multiple left-sided rib fractures are again noted. Remainder of the examination is otherwise unchanged. There is no rightward shift of mediastinal structures.
