Stable cardiac enlargement most likely reflecting cardiomegaly rather than pericardial effusion. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Lung volumes are lower and there is crowding of the vasculature. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect a component of atelectasis.
