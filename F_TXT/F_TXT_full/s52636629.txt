As compared to ___ chest radiograph, the patient has been intubated, with tip of endotracheal tube terminating approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Worsening right upper lobe opacity is suspicious for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, with differential diagnosis of aspiration and atelectasis. Note is also made of a probable small left pleural effusion.
