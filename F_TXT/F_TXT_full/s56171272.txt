The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. The lungs are clear except for linear atelectasis at the left base. No new areas of consolidation to suggest the presence of pneumonia, but standard PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for more complete evaluation of the lung bases if the patient's symptoms persist.
