In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a large-bore right subclavian catheter that extends to the right atrium, with its tip adjacent to that of the right IJ catheter. Endotracheal tube tip again lies about 6 cm above the carina and should be pulled down about 2 cm. Little change in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications.
