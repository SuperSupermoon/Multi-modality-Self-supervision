Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiac size is top normal. Widened mediastinum is a combination of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and enlargement of the pulmonary arteries is unchanged from prior. Right IJ catheter tip remains in the right atrium, could be withdrawn approximately 2 cm for a more standard position. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Bilateral extensive lung opacities have minimally worsened in the left upper lobe. The differential diagnosis still remains lung findings secondary of pulmonary ___-___ disease with pulmonary edema. These are associated with denser consolidations in the lower lobes and left upper lobe, likely due to pneumonia.
