Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Hazy opacity projecting over the left mid-to-lower lung may be due to a small pleural effusion with atelectasis. Underlying consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. No definite pulmonary edema is seen.
