A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Lung volumes are extremely low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. The endotracheal tube projects 5 mm above the carina directed towards the right main stem bronchus with the chin up, putting the patient at risk for bronchial intubation. The upper enteric tube ends in the stomach. The right subclavian line projects over the right atrium. Atelectasis in the right upper and left lower lobes are likely the result of the low endotracheal tube. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax. Gaseous distention of bowel is better assessed on the concurrent abdominal radiograph.
