Retrocardiac atelectasis and right basilar atelectasis persist. Better seen than on the previous radiograph is a 1 cm nodular lesion at the right upper lobe basis. Comparison with a frontal and lateral radiograph to be taken within the next ___hrs should be performed to determine the validity of this observation.
