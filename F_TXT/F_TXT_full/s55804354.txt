In comparison with the study of ___, the widening of the superior mediastinum is less prominent. Dense atelectatic streaks at the right base are again consistent with atelectasis. Opacification at the left base with silhouetting the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the low left lower lobe and small left pleural effusion. No evidence of appreciable pulmonary vascular congestion.
