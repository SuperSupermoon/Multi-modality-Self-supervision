A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates low lung volumes. Asymmetric increased opacity of the right hemithorax is again seen but overall less prominent, most likely representing improving pulmonary edema. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Bilateral pleural effusions appear more prominent. The visualized portion of the cardiomediastinum is unchanged, as is a right central catheter.
