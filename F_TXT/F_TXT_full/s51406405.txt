Single portable view of the chest. Since prior there has been interval placement of a endotracheal tube whose tip is at the carina and should be withdrawn. Left PICC again seen. NG tube passes below the inferior field of view. Bilateral, left greater than right pleural effusions are again noted. Remaining findings in the chest have not significantly changed.
