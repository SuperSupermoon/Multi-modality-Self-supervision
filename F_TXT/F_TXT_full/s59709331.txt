Interval placement of endotracheal tube, with tip terminating approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube has also been placed, but is not confidently visualized beyond the midthoracic esophagus on this relatively underpenetrated radiograph. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and is accompanied by worsening asymmetrical alveolar edema pattern, affecting the right lung to a greater degree than the left. Dense left retrocardiac opacity is new and may reflect a combination of atelectasis, dependent edema, and effusion.
