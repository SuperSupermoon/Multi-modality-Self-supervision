Study is limited by patient rotation and low lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. Mediastinal contours appear grossly unchanged. There is new mild to moderate pulmonary edema with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness. Retrocardiac opacification could reflect atelectasis combined with a small left pleural effusion, though pneumonia is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. Patchy opacity within the right lung base may also reflect an additional area of atelectasis.
