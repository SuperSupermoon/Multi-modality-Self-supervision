Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate interval development of pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial markings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. There has also been interval improvement in the bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured by pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. A hemodialysis catheter is again seen terminating in the right atrium. There has been interval removal of the nasogastric tube. A left-sided PICC line is again seen with the tip at the cavoatrial junction.
