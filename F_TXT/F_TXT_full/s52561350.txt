In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there is little overall change in the appearance of the orogastric tube. The side hole is close to the esophagogastric junction and should be pushed forward several cm. There are lower lung volumes with bibasilar atelectatic changes and mild hazy opacification of the lower lungs raising the possibility of layering pleural effusions.
