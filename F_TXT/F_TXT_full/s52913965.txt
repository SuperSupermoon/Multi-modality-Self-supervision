In comparison with the study of ___, there appears to be increased opacification of the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm. This suggests some volume loss in the left lower lobe as well as possible pleural effusion on this side. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or definite acute pneumonia.
