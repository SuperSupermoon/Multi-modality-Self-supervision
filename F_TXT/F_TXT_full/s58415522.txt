In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes. Indistinctness of the hemidiaphragms with hazy opacification at the bases again is consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. This is somewhat less prominent on the current study, though it could reflect merely a more erect position of the patient. The endotracheal tube remains in good position as does the nasogastric tube. The central catheter tip appears to be in the upper portion of the right atrium. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. There is mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
