Linear opacities within the lung bases are consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. There is evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion and central venous engorgement though no overt interstitial pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusions are evident. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Top normal size of the cardiac silhouette may be partly related to the AP technique though could also be secondary to developing pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is evident. A large-bore left-sided hemodialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium, unchanged from prior.
