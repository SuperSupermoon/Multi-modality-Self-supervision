In comparison with the study of ___, there are improved lung volumes. Continued opacification at the right base medially, concerning for pneumonia. Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm with blunting the costophrenic angles consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural fluid. There may be mild residual vascular congestion, though less prominent than on the previous study.
