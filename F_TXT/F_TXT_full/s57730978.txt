As compared to the previous radiograph, the atelectatic changes at the left lung base are substantially improved. However, the presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded, based on the minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinus on the left. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. Low lung volumes, no pulmonary edema.
