There has been interval placement of a right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter with tip projecting over the right atrium. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Redemonstration of vague opacity within the right upper lung is again noted and is more apparent on this exam. The technique is somewhat different; this film is somewhat more blurry. Vague opacity is also seen at the right lung base, probably atelectasis. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. Heart size is unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum and osseous structures are unchanged.
