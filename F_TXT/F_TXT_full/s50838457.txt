Compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The endotracheal tube and the other monitoring and support devices are constant. Pre-existing pleural effusions have minimally decreased in extent, so that the lung parenchyma has increased in transparency. However, bilateral pleural effusions are still present. Unchanged signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and bilateral basal areas of atelectasis. Mild cardiomegaly persists. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
