In comparison with the study ___ ___, the right IJ catheter may be slightly further withdrawn so that the tip extends just beyond the posterior aspect of the second rib. This has been progressively retracting superiorly over time. The endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. The NG tube extends at least to the second portion of the duodenum, where it crosses the lower margin of the image. Atelectatic changes are seen at the bases, especially on the left.
