The moderate right loculated pleural effusion has increased, particularly in the apical and lateral portions with resultant increasing consolidation in the right lung. While much of this is likely compressive atelectasis, concomitant pulmonary edema or infectious process would be difficult to exclude. Given the short time course, malignant progression is less likely. Left dependent pleural effusion is also likely increased with accompanying mild interstitial edema given the presence of thickened septal lines. The cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Left Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position with interval removal of right PICC. Bibasilar chest tubes are in similar position.
