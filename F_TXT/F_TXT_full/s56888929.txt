In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been a decortication procedure with left chest tube in place and virtually complete drainage of the empyema. Pigtail catheter is been removed. Mild postoperative changes are seen at the right base. No evidence of pneumothorax. The left lung remains essentially clear.
