As compared to the previous radiograph, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. The right venous introduction sheath is in unchanged position. There is unchanged massive cardiomegaly, with shape of the cardiac silhouette, potentially indicative of pericardial effusion. The bilateral overall subtle but diffuse parenchymal opacities, indicative of pulmonary edema, are without relevant change. No pleural effusions. No evidence of parenchymal bleeding. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base persists.
