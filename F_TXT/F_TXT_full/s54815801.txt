The right Port-A-Cath tip projects over the expected region of the mid SVC, unchanged. Vascular stent projects over the left upper mediastinum, unchanged. Clips project over the left lateral apex, also unchanged. The lungs are well-expanded and clear. No focal consolidation, edema, effusion, or pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinum is not widened. Aortic knob calcifications are mild. Detailed evaluation of the right apex is slightly obscured by catheter projecting over the lateral aspect of the right apex, presumed external to the patient. Dystrophic calcification in the left axillary region is unchanged.
