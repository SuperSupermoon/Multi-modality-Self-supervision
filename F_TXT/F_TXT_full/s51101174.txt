AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___. The patient remains intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea 5 cm above the level of the carina. There is now evidence of multiple sternotomy wires in the midline, apparently performed during the latest examination interval. There is a mediastinal drainage tube and left-sided chest tube advanced from below. A third tube terminates overlying the heart shadow and probably drains the pericardium. An additional left-sided chest tube has been advanced through the left lateral chest wall at the mid level and terminates in the apical area. An NG tube reaches below the diaphragm including the side port. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. The on previous examination identified a partial atelectasis in the right upper lobe area with volume loss has resolved and aeration appears to be ordinary. Overlying the left-sided heart shadow is a convolution of meandering wire loops, apparently the site of the cardiac left ventricular repair. Slightly below and in the upper left abdomen, a few surgical clips are identified, indicating surgical repair of injury in the upper abdomen as well. No new pulmonary or cardiovascular abnormalities are identified.
