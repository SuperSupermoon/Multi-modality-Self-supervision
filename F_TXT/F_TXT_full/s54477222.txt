Since prior, there has been no substantial change to bilateral parenchymal lung opacities, left greater than right. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Port ends in the low SVC as does a left PICC line. NGT enters the stomach and courses off of the radiograph. There is no pneumothorax.
