CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A right subclavian central line is present, tip in region of SVC/RA junction. There are low inspiratory volumes, which may contribute to diffuse increase in the lung markings. More focal patchy opacities at both bases are again seen. There is new prominence of markings in the left upper zone. This likely represents a combination of pneumonic infiltrates with ? some superimposed CHF. Minimal opacity noted at both costophrenic angles, but no gross effusion.
