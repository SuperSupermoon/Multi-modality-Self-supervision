A right chest tube has been removed. There is no pneumothorax. Aeration of the right lung has improved. There is some residual basilar atelectasis. A left-sided chest tube remains in place. However, the loop of the pigtail is not completely within the thoracic cavity. The position has not changed since recent radiographs. There is a moderate residual left pleural effusion and small residual right pleural effusion. There are no new abnormal cardiac contours. External pacing leads are in unchanged positions.
