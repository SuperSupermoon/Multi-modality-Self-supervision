Very low lung volumes reflected worsening moderate atelectasis in both lung bases and exaggerate borderline pulmonary edema, as well as the caliber of dilated mediastinal veins and heart size which is probably top- normal. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusions if present are not large. ET tube and right internal jugular vascular lines are in standard placements. Feeding tube probably passes beyond the upper stomach and out of view
