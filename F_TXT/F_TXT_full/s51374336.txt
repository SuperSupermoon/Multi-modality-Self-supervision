As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged alignment of the sternal wires. Pre-existing right pleural effusion and atelectasis at the right lung base has minimally increased. Moreover, the pre-existing small left pleural effusion is also unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly persists, but on today's radiograph, there are signs of mild pulmonary edema. In addition, the right aspects of the mediastinum have increased in diameter and density, potentially suggesting a widening of the superior vena cava. However, this change must be monitored to exclude the presence of a right mediastinal neoplasm.
