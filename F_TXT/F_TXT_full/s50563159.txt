AP chest compared to ___: Greater opacification on both sides of the chest is new since ___. It is difficult to distinguish moderate-to-large posteriorly layering pleural effusions from a combination of some pleural effusion and generalized pulmonary opacification, most commonly edema. There is still severe consolidation in the left lower lobe, though now with air bronchograms. This was previously left lower lobe collapse. Heart is enlarged but the margins are obscured, so comparison is not possible. Dual-channel left supraclavicular central venous line passes to the right brachiocephalic vein as before, crossing the right internal jugular line which ends in the upper SVC. The endotracheal tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 8 cm from the carina, and should be advanced 3 cm for more secured seating. No pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged at the time of dictation.
