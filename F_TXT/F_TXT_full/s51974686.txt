The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. Streaky opacities in the left lower lung suggest minor atelectasis. There is, more generally, mild coarsening of interstitial markings and peribronchial cuffing in the mid-to-lower lungs which may suggest airway inflammation or potentially slight fluid overload. A non-displaced fracture involving the right posterolateral eighth rib appears at least subacute and perhaps more remote. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
