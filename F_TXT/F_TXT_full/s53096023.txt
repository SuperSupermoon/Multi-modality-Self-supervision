Nasoenteric tube ends in the stomach. Left PICC ends in the lower SVC. Surgical clips project over the left axilla. A stent is noted in the abdomen. Since 1:51 a.m., right basilar opacity which may represent atelectasis or pleural thickening is unchanged. A small right pleural effusion is likely present. However, left basilar opacification and left pleural effusion have slightly increased. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged, increased from the prior study, without overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is stable.
