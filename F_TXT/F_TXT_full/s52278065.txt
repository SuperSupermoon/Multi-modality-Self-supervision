There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube with the pigtail projecting over the medial aspect of the left upper lung field with essentially near complete resolution of the left pneumothorax on this supine exam, and re-expansion of the left lung. Streaky opacities within the left mid lung field may reflect areas of atelectasis. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Mild emphysematous changes are noted in the right lung. Numerous fractures of the left fifth through tenth ribs are again noted, as seen previously, with associated subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall. Contrast from recent CT exam is seen within the collecting systems bilaterally.
