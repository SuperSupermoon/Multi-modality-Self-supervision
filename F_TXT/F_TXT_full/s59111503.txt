There is persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with opacity of the left hemithorax and elevation of the left mainstem bronchus and a stable Luftsichel sign, consistent with continued left upper lobe collapse although the volume of the collapsed lobe and the large central mass have mass have both decreased since ___. Right basilar atelectasis is noted and there could be a small metastatic nodule. There is no radiographic evidence of pneumonia, though evaluation on recent CT is more specific. The cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are unremarkable and unchanged since the prior examinations. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
