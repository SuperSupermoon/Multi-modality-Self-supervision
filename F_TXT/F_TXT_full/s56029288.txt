Portable AP view of the chest provided. Slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged. There is improved overall aeration within the lungs compared with prior exam without definite signs of pneumonia or CHF. Suture material is seen in the left pulmonary hilum, unchanged, compatible with prior partial lung resection. Tubular hyperdensity along the left heart border could represent a coronary stent. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Heart and mediastinal contours are stable with mild cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted. Imaged osseous structures are intact.
