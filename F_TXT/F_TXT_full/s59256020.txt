Since prior radiograph acquired 24 hours apart, there is no significant interval changes in the radiographic findings. Monitoring and supporting devices are in standard position. Endotracheal tube ends approximately 5.6 cm above the carina and is appropriate. Feeding tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach, however, with its distal end curled into the fundus of the stomach. Right internal jugular line ends at upper SVC. Bilateral lung volumes remain low. Bibasilar opacities, left side more than right side which represents atelectasis and associated effusion is similar. Assessment of mediastinal and hilar status and its comparison with prior radiograph was limited due to rotation of patient. No new lung opacities of concern.
