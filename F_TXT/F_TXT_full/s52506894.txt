The mentioned bronchial stent projects over the left hilus but the precise anatomic localization is not possible. Left upper lobe is now completely collapsed, there is also some increase in left basal consolidation and generalize nodular Lymphovenous distension or infiltration in the left lung. Findings point toward extensive central adenopathy and tumor involvement of the left hilus left lung and possibly left pleural space. There is no pneumothorax. Right lung is clear. Heart size is comparable. Central venous infusion catheter ends in the upper right atrium as before.
