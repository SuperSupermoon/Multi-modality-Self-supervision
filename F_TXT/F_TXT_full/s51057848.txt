In comparison with the study of ___, there has been the development of a large left pleural effusion filling the hemithorax to the level of the hilum. It is difficult to assess the cardiac silhouette. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Minimal opacification at the right base could represent small effusion with compressive atelectasis. Left subclavian catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
