CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. A left chest tube is present. It overlies the lower left lung. There is pleural fluid tracking along the left chest, with multiple left-sided rib fractures. The pleural effusion appears smaller compared with the film obtained earlier the same day (___ at 5:28 a.m.) No pneumothorax is detected. If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help to better define the position of the left-sided chest tube. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent as are the upper zone vessels, though these are likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. Probable atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic angle, but no definite right-sided effusion. Comminuted fracture of the left mid clavicle again noted.
