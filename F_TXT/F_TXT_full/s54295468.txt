In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change in the left lower lobe collapse and effusion at the left base. Atelectatic changes have developed at the right base. There is the vague suggestion of some increased opacification in the left perihilar region. Some of this probably represents the overlapping left scapula. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered.
