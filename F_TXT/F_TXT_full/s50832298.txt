Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study with persistent moderate bibasal pleural effusions and associated atelectasis. There are coarse interstitial markings bilaterally which may reflect interstitial pulmonary edema in this setting. The patient's known pulmonary nodules are difficult to visualize on today's study. The visualized bony structures the spine are densely sclerotic consistent with metastatic disease. Oral contrast material is noted in the colon.
