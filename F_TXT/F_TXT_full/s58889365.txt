As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the endotracheal tube is not substantially changed. Nasogastric tube and the right PICC line are also in unchanged position. The lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. Minimal decrease in extent of the left pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis and of a minimal left pleural effusion. No new focal parenchymal opacities.
