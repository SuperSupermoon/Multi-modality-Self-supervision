Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a small apical pneumothorax on the left and a likely loculated lateral left-sided hydro-pneumothorax. Stable appearing interstitial abnormality in the right lung may represent pulmonary edema versus dissemination of tumor. Again seen is a discrete metastatic mass in the right upper lobe.
