In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung volumes. Opacification at the right base again is consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. There are similar changes of volume loss in the left lower lobe and a small effusion on the left. Continued relatively low lung volumes may contribute to the apparent elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
