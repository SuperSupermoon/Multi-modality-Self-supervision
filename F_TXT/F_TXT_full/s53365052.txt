AP view of the chest. Left chest tube in place. There are low lung volumes and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm more than the right, and bibasilar atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are widened, but exaggerated likely due to low lung volumes. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusion.
