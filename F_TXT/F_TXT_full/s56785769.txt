Comparison is made to prior study from ___ at 7 p.m. There has been interval placement of pigtail catheter with the distal lead tip projecting over the upper chest. There is an extensive amount of suncutaneous emphysema throughout the chest. This is most prominent along the right side and at the left lower chest. There is a new endotracheal tube whose distal tip is at the level of the aortic knob. There is diffuse interstitial prominence and patchy ill-defined opacities. Multiple rib fractures are again seen better delineated on the prior CT scan.
