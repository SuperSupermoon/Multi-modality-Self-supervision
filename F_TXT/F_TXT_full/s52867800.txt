Right IJ catheter tip is either at the cavoatrial junction or upper portion of the right atrium. There is a right chest tube in place with no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size. Bilateral opacifications suggest pulmonary vascular congestion. There is only minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered.
