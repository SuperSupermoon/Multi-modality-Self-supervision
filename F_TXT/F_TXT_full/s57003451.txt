In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the left subclavian catheter now extends to the right atrium. The degree of left apical pneumothorax has substantially decreased with re-expansion of a portion of the upper left lung. The right lung remains clear. The right IJ sheath has been removed. Obliquity of the patient makes it difficult to determine whether there is any shift of the mediastinum to the left.
