Allowing for differences in technique and projection, there has been minimal interval change in the appearance of the chest. Right PICC has apparently been advanced at the proximal SVC. Bilateral pulmonary edema has a slightly more asymmetrical distribution, now worse on the right than the left side, and a moderate right pleural effusion has apparently slightly increased. Small left pleural effusion is again demonstrated as well as improving atelectasis in the left retrocardiac area.
