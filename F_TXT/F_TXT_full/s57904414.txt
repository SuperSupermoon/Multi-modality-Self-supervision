Compared with the prior study, there is negligible interval change. The right subclavian PICC line tip lies slightly higher, over the distal SVC. The previously seen punctate opacities at the left-greater-than-right bases appear slightly less pronounced at the left base, but are likely actually unchanged. These have been attributed to chronic punctate calcifications in the lung bases, possibly sequela of previous interstitial pneumonitis at a time of renal insufficiency (based on ___ chest CT). The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No CHF, focal infiltrate or consolidation, or effusion is identified. Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected. A mesh stent overlies the inner portion of the left arm
