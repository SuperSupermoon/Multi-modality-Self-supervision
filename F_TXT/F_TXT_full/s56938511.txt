As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right internal jugular vein catheter. The course of the catheter is unremarkable. The tip of the catheter projects over the mid-to-low SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.
