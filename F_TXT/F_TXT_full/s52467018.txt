As compared to the previous image, no relevant change is seen. Normal position of the endotracheal tube, the right PICC line and the nasogastric tube. As noted on the previous examination, the endotracheal tube is rather low and could be pulled back by 1-2 cm. The lung volumes remain very low, with minimal atelectasis at the right lung bases but no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac atelectasis persists.
