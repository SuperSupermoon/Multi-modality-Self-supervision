1. Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet. Spinal hardware overlies the upper thoracic vertebrae obscuring some detail. There appears to be improving aeration in the right lung, though the bronchial stent cannot be definitively identified, possibly being obscured by the spinal hardware. There continues to be a diffuse abnormality within the right lung and involving the right pleura consistent with known metastatic disease. Left lung remains hyperinflated without focal airspace consolidation. A 1.5 cm nodular opacity in the left lower lung is stable and remains suspicious for a pulmonary metastasis. The other lung nodules which are visualized on the CT study of ___ are not readily appreciable on the plain film study. Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult due to rightward deviation related to the right-sided volume loss. The left costophrenic angle is not entirely included on the study. No large left-sided effusion is appreciated. No pneumothorax.
