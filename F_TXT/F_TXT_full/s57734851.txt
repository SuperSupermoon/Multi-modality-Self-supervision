In comparison to the prior chest radiograph performed yesterday morning, there is no significant interval change. There is opacification of the left lung base, which may be due to overlapping soft tissue. However, underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude in the absence of a lateral view. There is no substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aortic arch. Limited evaluation of the right shoulder shows a sclerotic and flattened humeral head along with glenoid deformity. These findings are better demonstrated on the dedicated shoulder film dated ___.
