AP chest compared to ___: There is no detectable change in the left hemithorax since ___, including substantial left basal atelectasis and a volume of pleural fluid documented on imaging of the lung base on a CT of the abdomen, ___, not directly visible on the chest radiograph. Small right pleural effusion has increased. There is no pneumothorax on either side. Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes. There may be a slight interval increase in caliber of mediastinal veins, but no pulmonary edema. Of note, there is substantial distention of a gas-containing viscus in the left upper quadrant, either colon or stomach, probably the latter. A right PIC line ends in the mid-to-low SVC.
