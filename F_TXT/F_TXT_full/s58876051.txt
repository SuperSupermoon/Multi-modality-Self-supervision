Lung volumes are low. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Again noted is a tortuous aorta. In comparison to the priors, there is persistent pulmonary vascular congestion, possibly slightly progressed, though likely exaggerated due to low lung volumes. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified, though the semi-upright technique limits evaluation. Again noted is a 2 lead left-sided pacemaker with the leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle.
