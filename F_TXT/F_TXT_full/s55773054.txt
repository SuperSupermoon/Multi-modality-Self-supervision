Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube is in standard position, 5.6 cm above the carina. Cardiac size is top normal. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm as before. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Left internal jugular catheter tip is in the left brachiocephalic vein. Patient has known large right plural effusion, multiple bilateral lung nodules, some with cavitation, and left perihilar consolidation. These are unchanged and better seen in prior studies, including CT from ___. There are no new lung abnormalities or pneumothorax.
