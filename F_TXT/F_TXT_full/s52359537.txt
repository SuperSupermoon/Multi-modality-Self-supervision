AP chest compared to ___: Moderate-to-severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has changed in distribution, less asymmetric than before, but not in overall severity, since 7:47 p.m. on ___. The upper mediastinal veins are mildly dilated, so central venous pressure might be elevated, but sequence of events makes it unlikely that volume overload or cardiac decompensation were responsible unless the patient received large volumes of intravenous fluid. Left pleural masses, effusion and lower lobe atelectasis are chronic. Right subclavian line has been partially withdrawn and now ends proximal to the junction of brachiocephalic veins. Dr. ___ was paged to discuss this case at 9:50 a.m.
