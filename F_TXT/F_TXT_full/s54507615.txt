AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach. The left PICC line tip is at the level of mid to low SVC. Bibasal areas of atelectasis have substantially progressed since the prior study, in particular on the right but also subpulmonic pleural effusion is a possibility as well as there is a new atelectasis of the right middle lobe. The patient is rotated slightly that precludes precise comparison with prior imaging. Elevated right hemidiaphragm can potentially reflect the presence of the peritoneal fluid.
