In comparison with the study of ___, the bilateral pigtail catheters are unchanged. No definite pneumothorax in this patient with hyperexpansion of the lungs. The right upper lobe opacity continues to decrease. However, the opacity at the left base has increased and the hemidiaphragm is now silhouetted, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. Although the cardiac silhouette appears to be displaced toward the left, much of this could merely reflect obliquity of the patient, rather than mediastinal shift due to left lower lobe volume loss. Fracture of the midportion of the right clavicle is again seen.
