There is a prominent area of increased opacity at the left lung base, with increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, compatible with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is probably also an associated small to moderate size left pleural effusion. There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base, but the right lung is otherwise grossly clear. No gross right effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured, but appears similar to ___. No CHF.
