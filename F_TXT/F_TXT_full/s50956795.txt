There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube with tip terminating near the medial left mid lung field. Small pneumothorax seen on the previous CT exam is not clearly identified on the current study. There has been interval decrease in size of the left pleural effusion, now appearing small to moderate in size. Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral chest wall is noted. Again demonstrated are low lung volumes. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are similar possible small pneumomediastinum noted to the left lateral aspect of the aortic knob. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures without pulmonary edema. Bibasilar patchy opacities likely reflect areas of compressive atelectasis. Multiple displaced left-sided rib fractures are again noted.
