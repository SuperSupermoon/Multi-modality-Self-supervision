Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates increasing bilateral lower lobe opacities obscuring the diaphragmatic contours. There are new small bilateral pleural effusions as well. Several other areas of heterogeneous opacity are seen overlying the left heart border as well as in the infrahilar region on the right. There is no pneumothorax. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. A dual-chamber endotracheal tube terminates with the longer component within the left mainstem bronchus. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach and inferiorly out of the field of view.
