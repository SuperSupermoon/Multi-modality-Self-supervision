A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. The patient has been extubated. Lung volumes have decreased. Fullness and irregularity of the hila, aorticopulmonary window and azygos contour remain accentuated by low lung volumes. Bibasilar atelectasis has increased. New triangluar opacity at the right base may reflect fluid in the major fissure or atelectasis. No new consolidation or pneumothorax is present.
