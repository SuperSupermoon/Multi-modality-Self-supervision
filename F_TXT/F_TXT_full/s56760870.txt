Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the right atrium, as seen previously. Heart size is normal. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Lungs are hyperinflated with severe emphysema again noted, but without focal consolidation. Multiple previously demonstrated pulmonary nodules on CT are not as well assessed on the current radiograph. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Partially imaged within the upper abdomen is a stent within the common bile duct. Sclerotic serpiginous lesion in the proximal left humerus is incompletely imaged, potentially an enchondroma or bone infarct.
