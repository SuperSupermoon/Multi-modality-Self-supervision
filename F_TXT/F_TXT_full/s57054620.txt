A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained. Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since yesterday. Aeration of the lungs may be slightly improved, but central pulmonary vascular congestion and cephalization remain. The cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is no new consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.
