AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___ (pre-operative study). The patient is currently intubated with the ET tube tip being approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. The left chest tube is in place. There is no appreciable pneumothorax. The lumbar spine hardware is partially imaged. Lungs are essentially clear with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Of note is enlarged aortic arch that might reflect a combination of dilated aorta, substantial pulmonary artery and mediastinal fat but should be further assessed on the subsequent radiographs.
