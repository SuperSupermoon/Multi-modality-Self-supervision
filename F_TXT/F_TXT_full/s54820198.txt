Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a new focal consolidation with air bronchograms in the left lower lung with left peribronchial infiltrate. There is also a new hazy opacification extending from the right lung base to the level of the transverse aorta, consistent with large right pleural effusion. A left-sided Port-A-Cath is in standard position, terminating at the cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax or significant pulmonary edema. A biliary stent is seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
