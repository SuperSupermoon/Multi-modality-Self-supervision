Right central line is in unchanged position, terminating in the lower SVC. Endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina, in unchanged position. A nasogastric tube extends into the stomach. Stable, moderate cardiomegaly. Hilar and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Apparent increase in density in the left hemithorax is likely secondary to supine positioning with layering of the left pleural effusion, which is likely unchanged in size. Pulmonary edema has resolved on the right and has improved on the left. There is stable, severe left lower lobe atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. There is moderate, stable right lower lobe atelectasis and a small, stable right pleural effusion.
