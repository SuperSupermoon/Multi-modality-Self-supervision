AP chest compared to ___: Apparent increase in volume of postoperative pneumoperitoneum may be due to change in patient position, now more erect. ET tube and left subclavian line in standard placements respectively. No pneumothorax. Opacification at both lung bases is probably a combination of worsening atelectasis and small pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is larger due in part to lower lung volumes, but probably greater intravascular volume as well.
