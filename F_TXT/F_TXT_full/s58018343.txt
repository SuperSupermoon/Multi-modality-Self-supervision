Compared to the prior study there is little interval change. Again seen is a right IJ central line tip overlying the distal most SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Vascular plethora is similar to the prior film. Patchy retrocardiac opacity is also unchanged. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is also unchanged. No pneumothorax detected.
