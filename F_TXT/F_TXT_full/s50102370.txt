In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with ill-defined pulmonary vessels consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The area of opacification at the left base appears somewhat less prominent, consistent with slow clearing of an infectious process. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. No definite pneumothorax with the right pigtail catheter in place.
