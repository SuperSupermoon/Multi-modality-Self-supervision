Low bilateral lung volumes with interval increase in size of the pleural effusions, particularly the left. Interval worsening of the patchy airspace opacities in both lungs which may reflect pulmonary edema or multifocal pneumonia. No pneumothorax identified. The evaluation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is limited secondary to the adjacent pleural effusions.
