No pneumothorax. There may be a small left pleural effusion, unchanged. Opacification in the left lower chest obscuring the descending thoracic aorta could be pneumonia or, more likely, atelectasis. Lateral view would be helpful, but given severe scoliosis chest CT may be necessary depending on patient's mobility. Right lung is clear. Heart is not enlarged. ET tube is in standard placement, just less than 3 cm above the carina, with the mandible flexed. Transesophageal drainage tube ends in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced 10 cm to move all side ports beyond the GE junction. No pneumoperitoneum.
