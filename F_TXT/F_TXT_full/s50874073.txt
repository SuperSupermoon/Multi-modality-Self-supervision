Assessment is limited by patient positioning and the patient's head and chin obscuring assessment of the lung apices, more so on the right. Heart size appears unchanged, and top-normal. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic with streaky opacity in the right lung base compatible with atelectasis. No gross focal consolidation, pleural effusion or large pneumothorax is identified, but assessment again is limited. There is no pulmonary edema. Percutaneous gastrostomy catheter is seen in the left upper abdomen. Diffuse gaseous distension of bowel loops are seen in the upper abdomen. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
