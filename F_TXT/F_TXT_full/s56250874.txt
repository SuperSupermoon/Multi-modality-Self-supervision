1. Tracheostomy remains in place. A face mask obscures the lung apices. A left internal jugular central line is unchanged in position likely within the brachiocephalic vein. The heart remains enlarged. There is a layering left effusion and likely a smaller right effusion. There is increasing prominence of the perihilar vasculature and indistinctness of the more peripheral vasculature, which may reflect mild pulmonary interstitial edema. Clinical correlation is advised. Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of effusion, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No large pneumothorax is appreciated.
