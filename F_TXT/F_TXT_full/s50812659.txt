When compared with the immediate prior study ___, the right base opacification is more prominent, and there is new perifissural atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions have resolved, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. Given the improvement on the previous radiographs of ___, the increased right-sided opacities likely represent atelectatic changes. The endotracheal tube ends 3.3 cm from the carina, the right subclavian line ends at the cavoatrial junction. The enteric tube coils within a nondistended stomach. The left lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
