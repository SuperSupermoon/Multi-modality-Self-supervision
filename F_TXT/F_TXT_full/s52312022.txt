Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. Feeding tube continues to coil in the stomach with distal tip directed cephalad in the fundus. Cardiomediastinal contours are slightly decreased in width, accompanied by improved pulmonary vascular congestion. Band-like focus of atelectasis is present in the right upper lobe, and persistent bilateral lower lobe retrocardiac opacities are demonstrated, most likely due to atelectasis and less likely an infectious consolidation. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no visible pneumothorax.
