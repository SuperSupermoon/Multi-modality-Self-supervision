In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Left chest tube remains in place without evidence of pneumothorax. Opacification along the left lateral chest wall is consistent with pleural fluid. The opacification in the left mid and lower zone most likely reflects re-expansion edema combined with residual pleural fluid and atelectatic changes. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia. Cardiac silhouette again is prominent and there is mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure and atelectatic changes at the right base. The left subclavian catheter is no longer seen.
