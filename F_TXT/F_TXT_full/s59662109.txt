Portable frontal chest radiograph was performed. A endotracheal tube is 8 cm above the carina. A left pectoral pacemaker/AICD is present. There are bilateral perihilar ground glass opacities, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacity may be a small left pleural effusion. Fluid is seen within the minor fissure. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
