Portable AP view of the chest provided. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 2 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are low, and there are scattered perihilar opacities likely reflecting bronchovascular crowding and/or scattered subsegmental atelectasis. The possibility of trace aspiration is also raised. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Clips reside in the right breast. Bony structures are intact.
