Compared to ___, there is a new partially well defined (lateral margin in not clearly seen) rounded density projecting over the right mid lung. Whether this is a mass, infection or infarction depends upon chronicity, unfortunately unknown. Additionally, there is greater heterogenous opacification of the right lower lobe, that could be pneumonia or a condition such as bronchioloalveolar carcinoma since there was similar but less extensive opacification in this region in ___. There is a small right pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly is a little worse. A left chest wall pacemaker sends transvenous leads to the right atrium and right ventricle. There is no pneumothorax.
