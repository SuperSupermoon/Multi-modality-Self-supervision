In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 2.7 cm above the carina. The left IJ catheter has been removed. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. There is continued extensive opacification at the right base consistent with a combination of volume loss in the lower lung and pleural effusion. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema persists. Less prominent atelectasis and effusion are seen at the left base. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is essentially unchanged.
