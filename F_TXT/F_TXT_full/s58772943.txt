A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The lungs are well expanded. There is no focal consolidation, left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Increased opacity at the lung bases bilaterally are likely atelectasis or scarring and there is a small right pleural effusion. Heart size is within normal limits. The aorta is tortuous with aortic knob calcifications. Degenerative change is seen in the left shoulder girdle.
