Single frontal portable view of the chest was obtained. The heart is of normal size. Bilateral patchy pulmonary opacities are new since the prior radiograph, exaggerated by low lung volumes, and may represent multifocal pneumonia or aspiration. There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle, compatible with small pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures are unremarkable and known osseous metastases are not appreciated on this exam. A metallic biliary stent is seen in the right upper quadrant.
