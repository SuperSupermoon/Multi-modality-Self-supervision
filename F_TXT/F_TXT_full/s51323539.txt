A double lumen catheter has been retracted mostly out of the chest. Its tip now terminates over the right upper hemithorax, almost definitely extravascular and probably within overlying soft tissues rather than within the chest cavity. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. The lungs appear clear aside from minimal streaky left lower lung atelectasis with plate-like morphology. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
