ET tube has been removed. Dobbhoff or other orogastric tube is present, extending beneath the diaphragm, beyond the inferior exam of the film. The patient is status post sternotomy. There is a left-sided dual lead pacemaker with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle. A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is noted. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is similar to the prior study. The left hemidiaphragm is slightly elevated, arguably more so than on the prior film. However, although there is retrocardiac patchy opacity, it is is similar and probably very slightly improved compared with the prior study. Mild right-greater-than-left upper zone redistribution and minimal patchy opacity, question atelectasis, are seen in the cardiophrenic region, similar to the prior study. No pneumothorax detected. No gross effusion.
