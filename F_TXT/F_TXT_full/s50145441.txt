Frontal radiograph of the chest again demonstrates a Swan-Ganz catheter which is far past midline into likely segmental right pulmonary artery. It should be retracted by at least 6-7 cm for more appropriate positioning in the proximal pulmonary artery. As compared to prior study, the lung volumes remain low, accentuating the cardiac contour. The heart and mediastinum are unremarkable. Diffuse right lung opacities are slightly improved with worsened opacification of the left lung, likely equilibrating pulmonary edema. No pleural abnormality is seen.
