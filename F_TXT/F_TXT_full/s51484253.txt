The patient has had recent CABG with intact and aligned sternotomy wires. The left pectoral AICD and left ventricular assist device are unchanged in position. A tracheostomy tube terminates in the mid trachea. A nasogastric tube enters the stomach, tip not visualized. A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the main pulmonary trunk. Increased bilateral airspace opacities are most likely due to worsening pulmonary edema. A persistent retrocardiac airspace opacity is probably due to atelectasis. The main pulmonary artery is prominent as in the past. Marked cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged. The small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
