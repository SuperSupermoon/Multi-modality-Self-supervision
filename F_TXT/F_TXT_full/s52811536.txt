A tracheostomy is in-situ, unchanged in position. A left-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC. There is moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged compared to the prior study. Bibasilar opacities have improved somewhat on the right. There is residual left basal opacity likely reflecting atelectasis. Infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax seen.
