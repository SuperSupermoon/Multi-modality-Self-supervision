Compared with ___, there is new opacification of the right mid and lower zones, likely reflecting a moderately large, right effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation and obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm. The right heart border is also obscured. There is vascular plethora in the right upper zone which may be secondary to compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected. A single surgical clip or fiducial is seen at the right lung base medially, with note made of interval change in position. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains grossly midline and, where visible, is similar to the prior study. The left lung is grossly clear, without CHF or frank consolidation. There is minimal atelectasis/ scarring at the left lung and possible slight blunting of left costophrenic angle, similar to the prior study.
