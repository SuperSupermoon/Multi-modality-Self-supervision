As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a massive increase in extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities. This increases particularly obvious in the right upper lobe, the right lung base and the retrocardiac lung areas. The lung volumes remain low. There is evidence of small bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right. Unchanged rightward deviation of the trachea. Calcified degenerative left shoulder disease.
