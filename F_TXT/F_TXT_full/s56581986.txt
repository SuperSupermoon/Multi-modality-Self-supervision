Since the prior study, there is now opacity at the right lung base worrisome for right middle lobe atelectasis. Small right pleural effusion was also seen on pre seeding chest CT. The left lung is clear. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are grossly stable. No pneumothorax is seen.
