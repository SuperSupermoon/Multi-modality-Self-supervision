The ET tube and the right- and left-sided chest tubes half been removed. A left IJ line tip overlies the brachiocephalic vessel and appears very slightly retracted compared with ___. A left subclavian PICC line overlies the mid SVC. An NG type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. There is increased opacity at the right base, likely a combination of a pleural effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. A small left effusion is likely larger. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is gross unchanged. No pneumothorax is detected. The heart is enlarged, though the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable. There is mild upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, without other evidence of CHF.
