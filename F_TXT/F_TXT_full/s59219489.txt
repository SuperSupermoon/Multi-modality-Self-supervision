Semi-upright frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube in appropriate position, terminating 6 cm above the carina. An esophageal tube is also in place, which courses below the diaphragm, into the stomach and out of view. The heart is moderately to severely enlarged in size, with pulmonary vascular congestion and perihilar haze consistent with mild pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. There may be a small right pleural effusion.
