The endotracheal tube ends 5.2 cm above the level of the carina, not significantly changed. A left PICC ends in the mid SVC. An enteric catheter passes below the level of the diaphragm and out of field-of-view inferiorly. The side port of the catheter is near the gastroesophageal junction. Right mid-to-lower lung opacities continue to improve. There is mild plate-like bibasilar atelectasis, improved on the left. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There are no pleural effusions. No definite pneumothorax, although the uppermost portion of both apices were excluded from this radiograph.
