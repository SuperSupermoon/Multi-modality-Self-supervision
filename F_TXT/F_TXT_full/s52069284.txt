1. Persistent retrocardiac consolidation which would be concerning for aspiration or pneumonia, less likely compressive atelectasis in the setting of a layering small effusion. There is increasing airspace opacity at the right medial lung base. In addition, there is a perihilar fullness and and evidence of peribronchial cuffing suggesting superimposed mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. The endotracheal tube and left subclavian central line are unchanged in position. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Low lung volumes.
