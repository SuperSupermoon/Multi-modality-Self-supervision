There continue to be bilateral layering effusions, right greater than left, with associated patchy bibasilar airspace disease which may reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Mediastinal widening particularly in the right paratracheal vicinity likely reflects lymphadenopathy which is evident on an outside CT. Overall, cardiac size is stable. There is a catheter overlying the heart which may be pericardial in position. No pneumothorax is seen.
