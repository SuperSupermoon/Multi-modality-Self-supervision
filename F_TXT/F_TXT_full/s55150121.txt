Rotated positioning. Again seen is moderate cardiomegaly. No definite CHF. Minimal atelectasis at both lung bases, but no convincing focal infiltrate and no consolidation identified. Previously seen increased markings at the right base have improved. No gross effusion on either side. The extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.
