Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained 10:25 a.m. The ET tube is slightly lower than expected, 2.3 cm above the carina and should be pulled back 1 cm. Right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction/low SVC. The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm with its tip noted probably just distal to the gastroesophageal junction and should be further advanced. Left retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen, although minimal amount of left apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded.
