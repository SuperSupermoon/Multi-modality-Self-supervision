The patient remains intubated. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is a persistent extensive opacity in the left mid to upper lung that appears decreased. Specifically, this film is centered on the hemidiaphragms in order to assess for nasogastric tube placement. The nasogastric tube terminates in the distal esophagus where it makes a half coil. The stomach is mild to moderately distended. There is no free air.
