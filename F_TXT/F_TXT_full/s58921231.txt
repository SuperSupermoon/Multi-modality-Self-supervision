There is been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter with the tip terminating in the mid to lower right atrium, which should be retracted 5 cm to place in the low SVC. An enteric tube terminates in the lower esophagus, which should be advanced for proper positioning. The lung volumes remain low. There is right basilar opacification. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
