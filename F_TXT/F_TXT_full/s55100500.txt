Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. The right subclavian PICC line and right pleural catheter are unchanged in position. There is a stable right effusion with associated airspace opacity at the right base and soft tissue opacity involving the right inferior hilum. When correlated with chest CT ___, these findings are consistent with partial lower and middle lobe collapse and/or pneumonia along with known malignancy. When compared to the study of ___, the pleural effusion has decreased in overall size likely related to chest tube placement. The remaining lungs appear clear, although by CT, multiple metastatic nodules are present. A subtle an air-fluid level at the right lung base may reflect a loculated hydro pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged. There has been resection of the right posterior fifth rib. The multiple rib and spinal metastases seen on recent CT are not well seen on the plain film study.
