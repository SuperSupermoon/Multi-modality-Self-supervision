AP portable supine view of the chest. There has been interval intubation with the endotracheal tube tip residing 1.7 cm above the carina. The endogastric tube descends into the mid upper abdomen. Lung volumes are markedly low limiting assessment. Increased opacities in the left lung may reflect atelectasis or aspiration. There is partial collapse of the right upper lobe. No supine evidence for large effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess given suboptimal technique.
