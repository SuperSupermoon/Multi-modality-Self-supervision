There is probable background hyperinflation/COPD. There is mild cardiomegaly. The aortic and hilar contours are obscured by the surrounding parenchymal changes. There are extensive increased interstitial markings in both lungs, with more honeycomb appearance in the right upper zone. The appearance is suggestive of chronic parenchymal scarring, but the possibility of a superimposed interstitial process or interstitial edema would be difficult to exclude. Probable background blebs and bullae in both lungs. Minimal blunting of left-greater-than-right costophrenic angles. Increased retrocardiac opacity, also of uncertain etiology or acuity. Asymmetric left apical pleural thickening noted. A metallic BB overlies the right lung base. Based on this single frontal view, this could either lie within or outside of the the patient. Probable background osteopenia. There is an apparent ununited fracture of the lateral portion of the right clavicle at the level of the coracoid. No displacement or elevation is appreciated.
