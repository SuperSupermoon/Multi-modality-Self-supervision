Lordotic positioning. There are low inspiratory volumes. There is evidence of CHF with pulmonary edema, similar to ___ at 10:53 a.m., but slightly worse in the right upper zone. A small-to-moderate right effusion is also probably slightly worse. Small left effusion and left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation are similar. Possibility of underlying infectious infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.
