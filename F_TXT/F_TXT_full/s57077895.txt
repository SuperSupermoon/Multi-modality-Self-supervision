AP chest radiograph demonstrates a right tunneled central catheter terminating in low SVC. Cervical and upper thoracic fusion hardware is again noted. Lung volumes are low. Nodular opacity in the right upper lobe is new from the prior study. A well defined nodular density overlying the left mid lung field corresponds to a rib callous seen on most recent CT of ___. Interstital opacities in the right upper lobe and left lung base are unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion.
