Endotracheal tube is now seen. The carina is difficult to visualize on this exam but the tube tip is approximately 2 cm from the carina. Increased interstitial markings seen throughout the lungs much of which can be attributed to dependent atelectasis seen on subsequent CT scan. More dense retrocardiac opacity is also likely due to atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Lucency at the left lung apex correlates with blebs identified on CT scan.
