Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 3.7 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. There is a right-sided central line with distal lead tip in the cavoatrial junction. There is a nasogastric tube whose tip and side port are below the GE junction. There is again seen cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions, left worse than right. There are more confluent areas of opacity within the right mid lung field and the left base. Underlying superimposed pneumonia is not excluded. Overall, these findings appear stable.
