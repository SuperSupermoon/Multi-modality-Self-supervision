AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Position of previously described right-sided subclavian central venous line and left-sided PICC is unchanged. As before, there is mediastinal shift towards the left hemithorax which now is completely opacified, demonstrating complete loss of aeration of the left lung. This finding occurring in combination with left-sided mediastinal shift is highly suggestive of central airway obstruction which is probably accomplished by mucus plugs. There is no evidence of new pulmonary infiltrates in the right lung; however, the vascular pattern suggests some degree of congestion with possible mild increase of pleural effusion, now partially obliterating the diaphragmatic contours.
