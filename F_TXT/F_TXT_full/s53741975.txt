In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric tube extends to at least the mid body of the stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the image. If the precise position of the tip is of clinical importance, repeat study could be obtained including more of the abdomen. Although not well seen, there appears to be an endotracheal tube in place with its tip about 4.5 cm above the carina. Otherwise little change.
