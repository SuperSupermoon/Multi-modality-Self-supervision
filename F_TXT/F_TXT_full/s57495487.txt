The lung volumes are normal. Bilateral apical scarring, unchanged as compared to the previous examination. Flattened hemidiaphragms, potentially indicative of mild overinflation. Minimal areas of atelectasis at the left lung bases but no evidence of acute lung disease such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. The hilar and mediastinal structures are normal.
