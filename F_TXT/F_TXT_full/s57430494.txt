The patient remains intubated. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its tip not imaged. An introducer catheter again resides in the left internal jugular vein. The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A left-sided chest tube is unchanged. A portion of the left lung base is excluded. Hazy background opacification suggests mild vascular congestion. Small layering pleural effusions are suspected. Increasing retrocardiac opacification is non-specific but is most commonly due to atelectasis following cardiac surgery. There is no pneumothorax.
