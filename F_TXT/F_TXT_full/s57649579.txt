AP chest compared to ___: Moderate to large right pleural effusion is larger obscuring much of the right lower lung, where probable right lower pneumonia was previously visible. Another definite change is substantial increase in caliber of mediastinal vessels suggesting volume overload, although heart size is normal and there is no appreciable vascular engorgement. Subsequent chest radiograph, 5:29 a.m., reported separately.
