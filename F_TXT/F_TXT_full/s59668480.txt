AP chest compared to ___ and ___ at 10:20 a.m. Severe somewhat asymmetric pulmonary opacification, favoring the right lung has not changed appreciably over the past 11 hours. Patient has had median sternotomy and coronary bypass surgery and the heart is mildly-to-moderately enlarged. Pleural effusions if present are not large. The bulk of pulmonary findings are probably due to pulmonary edema. Alternatively there could have been initiating extensive pneumonia in the right lung leading to noncardiogenic edema, but cardiac causes or volume overload should be considered first. No pneumothorax.
