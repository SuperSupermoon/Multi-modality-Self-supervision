Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There is a right-sided PICC, terminating in the proximal SVC, without evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. No large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace right pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. No definite focal consolidation is seen. No pulmonary edema is seen.
