Again seen is a right-sided PICC line. Its position is unchanged over several films, overlying the right atrium, distal to the cavoatrial junction. The previously seen Dobhoff type tube is no longer visualized. A TIPS stent is faintly seen in the right upper quadrant. Additional embolization material in other small densities are noted in the upper abdomen. No pneumothorax is detected. Mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Hazy density in the left lung could reflect a layering pleural effusion. Again seen is retrocardiac opacity obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is vascular plethora and mild vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. This may be accentuated by slightly low volumes. No pneumothorax detected.
