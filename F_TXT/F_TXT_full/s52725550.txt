Right-sided Port-A-Cath is noted, terminating in the low SVC. The right causing angles not fully included. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta somewhat tortuous. There it is central pulmonary vascular engorgement. Opacity projecting over the left upper hemi thorax is seen which could be due to consolidation versus overlap of structures. Suggest dedicated PA and lateral views when patient able, or at minimum, followup when patient able. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen. Limited assessment of the osseous structures demonstrates no displaced fracture.
