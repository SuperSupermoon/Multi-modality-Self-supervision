The right subclavian central line tip overlies the proximal SVC, unchanged. Minimal interval change in the appearance of the lungs with low inspiratory volumes, and findings suggestive of pulmonary edema. There is however slightly increased aeration of the right infrahilar region. There is a persisting retrocardiac opacity likely secondary to atelectasis and/or a small effusion. No pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.
