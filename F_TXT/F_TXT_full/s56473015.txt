1. Interval placement of a right subclavian PICC line which has its tip in the mid SVC. A left-sided AICD remains in place with three leads unchanged in position. The overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given patient's rotation to the left on the current study. Lungs are well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. A few streaky opacities at the right costophrenic angle may reflect subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. No pneumothorax is seen.
