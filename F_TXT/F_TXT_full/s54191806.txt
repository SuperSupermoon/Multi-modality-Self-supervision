Right subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is identified. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Widening of the superior mediastinum, particularly the right paratracheal stripe, corresponds to lymphadenopathy and ill-defined soft tissue density within the mediastinum, better assessed on recent CT. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is new compared to the prior radiograph with a layering moderate size right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion, also new from prior. Worsening opacification of the lung bases, particularly on the left with air bronchograms, reflect regions of compressive atelectasis as seen on the prior CT.
