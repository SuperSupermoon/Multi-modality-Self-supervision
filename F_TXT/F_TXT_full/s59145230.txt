Again seen are multifocal airspace opacities, most confluent in the left upper lobe with relative clearing of a previously demonstrated confluent opacity at the right lung base. Appearances are suspicious for multifocal pneumonia versus asymmetric pulmonary edema. No definite pleural effusion seen. No pneumothorax seen. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. There has been interval removal of a left-sided PICC and a right-sided internal jugular catheter. A right shoulder arthroplasty is noted.
