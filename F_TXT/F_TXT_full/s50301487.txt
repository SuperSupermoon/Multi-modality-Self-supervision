Lung volumes remain low although slightly improved compared to the prior study. A calcified thyroid nodule is again noted. A right-sided PICC terminates in the upper right atrium/cavoatrial junction. There are patchy airspace opacities throughout the left lung, similar in appearance when compared to the prior study. Opacities in the right lung are less conspicuous than on the prior study. No definite pleural effusion, no pneumothorax seen.
