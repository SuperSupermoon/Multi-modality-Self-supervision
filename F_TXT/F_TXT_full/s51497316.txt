Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates severe dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine, somewhat distorting the anatomy. Within this limitation, the mediastinum and left hilum appear unremarkable. The patient is status post a right upper lobectomy with evidence of volume loss and chain sutures projecting over the right upper lung. A small pneumothorax is identified in addition to subcutaneous emphysema, not unexpected in the immediate postoperative state. No large pulmonary opacification identified. No pleural effusion present. Endotracheal tube terminates 3.6 cm above the carina
