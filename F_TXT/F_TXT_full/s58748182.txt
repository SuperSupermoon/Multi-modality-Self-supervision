As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an aortic stent graft. A soft tissue density along the aortic arch and the left aspect of the descending aorta corresponds to the known intramural hematoma. There is stable minimal widening of the ascending aorta. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No pneumonia, no pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema. Minimal contour irregularities along several ribs on the right could reflect old healed rib fractures.
