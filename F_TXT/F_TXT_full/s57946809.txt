The fact that 2, thin parallel lines projecting high over the right apex are probably external artifact, rather than pneumothorax, can be confirmed with repeat chest radiograph after removal of all external materials. There has been interval decrease in right pleural effusion. Right middle and lower lobe are still collapsed. Left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion is again seen. Nodular opacity in the left lung is a residual of pulmonary infarct, shown on the chest CTA, ___. The heart is enlarged, though unchanged from prior. Moderate hiatal hernia is again seen.
