AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Marked cardiomegaly as before. Position of permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position connected to total of three electrodes terminating in right atrium, right ventricle and venous coronary sinus system in unchanged position. The pulmonary vasculature remains unchanged and shows moderate degree of perivascular haze, consistent with chronic congestion. Obliteration of left-sided diaphragmatic contour is suggestive of atelectasis in left lower lobe. The right-sided lateral pleural sinus is free from any fluid accumulation and there is no pneumothorax in the apical area. No evidence of new discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.
