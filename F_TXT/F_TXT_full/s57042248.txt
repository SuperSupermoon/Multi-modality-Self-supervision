1. Right internal jugular sheath unchanged in position. A left-sided pacemaker also unchanged. Status post median sternotomy for CABG. The heart continues to be enlarged and has a globular configuration which could reflect cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion should also be considered. There is a persistent but improved vascular congestion. There is persistent retrocardiac opacity which may reflect patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There are likely small effusions. In addition, there is an apparent right upper lobe asymmetry which may represent residual pulmonary edema, although an evolving infectious process in this area cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is advised and followup imaging should be performed as clinically indicated. No pneumothorax.
