In comparison to ___, there is increased opacification of the left lung base consistent with combination of substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and left pleural effusion. Otherwise little change. Left upper lobe lucency is projectional due to patient positioning rather than pneumothorax. Heart is partially obscured due to parenchymal abnormality. Mediastinal contour and hila are unremarkable. Enteric feeding tube courses midline with tip out of field of view. A right IJ CVL tip is in the low SVC. An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position.
