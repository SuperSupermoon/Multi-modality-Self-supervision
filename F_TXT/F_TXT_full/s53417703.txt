Heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. More focal opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis but infection is not excluded. There appears to be background hyperinflation suggestive of underlying COPD. 11 mm nodular opacity projects over the right upper lung field. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
