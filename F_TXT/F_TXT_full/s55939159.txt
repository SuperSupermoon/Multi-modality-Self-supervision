Large right pleural effusion, probably loculated along the right chest wall, developed between ___ and ___, subsequently unchanged. Large right hilar and infrahilar opacities may contain central cavitation. Differentiating cavitated mass from a postobstructive infection would be possible with repeat chest CT. There is no cavitation on ___. Left infrahilar consolidation could be pneumonia also or atelectasis, responsible in part, along with the right pleural effusion, for leftward mediastinal shift. Heart is not enlarged. Diffuse coarse interstitial pulmonary abnormality, as seen on the chest CT, is probably pulmonary fibrosis in the setting of severe emphysema. .
