Right internal jugular dual-lumen large bore catheter again has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, although the right effusion has decreased in size in the interim given recent thoracentesis. Persistent bibasilar opacities with improved aeration at the right base likely reflecting atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Interval resolution of pulmonary edema.
