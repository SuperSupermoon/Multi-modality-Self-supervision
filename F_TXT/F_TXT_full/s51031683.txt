There are increased opacities in the lung bases, left greater than right. Findings likely reflect recurrence of bilateral pleural effusions. Underlying consolidation may be due to atelectasis, though aspiration or pneumonia, particularly in the left lung base, cannot be excluded. Mild vascular congestion is evident, however, there is no overt pulmonary edema. Detailed evaluation of the hilum and cardiac contours is limited due to basilar opacities, but there is marked cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax. A right PICC line terminates in the mid SVC.
