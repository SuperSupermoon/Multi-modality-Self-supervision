As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased, causing increased crowding at the lung bases. The subsequent loss of transparency is further emphasized by the pre-existing pleural effusion that is unchanged. There is no focal increase in lung density that would be suggestive of pneumonia but short-term radiographic followup should be performed. No pneumothorax. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged change right pectoral Port-A-Cath.
