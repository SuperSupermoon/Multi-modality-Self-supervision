Residual right pleural effusion is small if any, unchanged since at least ___. Pigtail pleural drainage catheter still coiled at the right base. Moderate cardiomegaly is long-standing. There is no pulmonary edema. Greater opacification of the right lower lobe is probably a combination of residual atelectasis. Pacer defibrillator leads unchanged in their respective positions, originating in the left pectoral generator. Right PIC line ends just proximal to the origin of the SVC. No pneumothorax.
