As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged alignment of the sternal wires and the clips of the bypass surgery. The patient has made a stronger inspiratory effort. However, there is still suspicion of a small left pleural effusion with subsequent areas of left basal and retrocardiac atelectasis. Atelectasis is also seen at the bases of the right lung, probably caused by elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and interposition of colon between the liver and the abdominal wall. Fluid overload, if present, is minimal. No pneumothorax. Known calcified pleural plaques.
