Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. A right internal jugular central line is unchanged. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably enlarged. There is interval improvement in the pulmonary edema. Small layering left effusion and possibly a smaller right effusion are again seen. Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect patchy atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
