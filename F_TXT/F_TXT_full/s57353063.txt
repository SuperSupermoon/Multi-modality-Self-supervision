As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a further increase in extent of a left pleural effusion with increased atelectatic opacities at the left lung base. The lung volumes have further decreased, causing increased vascular markings, likely aggravated by mild pulmonary edema. The feeding tube has been pulled back. The course of the left PICC line is constant and unchanged.
