The multiple right sided posterior rib fractures are again seen. The previously seen small right apical pneumothorax on the cervical spine CT is not appreciated on this plain radiograph. The heart remains mildly enlarged. The lungs are low in volumes but without focal airspace consolidation. The patchy opacity in the right upper lung has resolved suggesting that it represented atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Marked colonic gas shows distension.
