1. Interval removal of the right internal jugular central line. The endotracheal tube is unchanged in position with its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There is persistent bibasilar airspace disease with associated layering effusions, but overall there has been some interval improvement in aeration in the left mid upper lung. These findings therefore more likely represent an improvement in moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema rather than an infectious process. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged, although somewhat difficult to assess due to the bibasilar airspace consolidation. No pneumothorax.
