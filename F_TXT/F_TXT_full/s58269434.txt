Compared the prior study, enteric tube has been advanced, coursing below the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image, side port at the level of the proximal stomach. Endotracheal tube and right IJ central catheter remain similar in position. Again, there are bilateral pleural effusions and left base retrocardiac opacity. Signs of mild fluid overload are similar. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
