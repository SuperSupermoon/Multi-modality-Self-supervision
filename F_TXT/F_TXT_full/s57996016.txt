AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lung volumes are quite low, exaggerating what is at least mild cardiomegaly and some pulmonary vascular engorgement, and probably explaining mild-to-moderate bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis. I doubt that there is pulmonary edema or pneumonia or appreciable pleural effusion.
