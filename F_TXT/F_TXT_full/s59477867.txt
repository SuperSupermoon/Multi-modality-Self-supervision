AP chest compared to ___: Opacification in the both lower lobes has worsened, now both are nearly uniformly opacified. Although I cannot discount the possibility of pneumonia, the appearance is more suggestive of bilateral lower lobe collapse, accompanied by small bilateral pleural effusions. Heart is moderately enlarged. Pulmonary vascular engorgement is relatively mild. A feeding tube ends in the mid stomach. Inferior vena caval umbrella filter noted. Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax.
