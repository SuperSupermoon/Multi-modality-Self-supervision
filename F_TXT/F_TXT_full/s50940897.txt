1. Interval appearance of a consolidative process in the right lower lobe which is concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. Given the absence of peribronchial cuffing, the asymmetric opacity at the right base is not likely secondary to pulmonary edema. Stable linear opacity at the left base likely represents subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. Lungs remain hyperinflated with emphysematous bullous changes involving the apices. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema on the current study. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Results of this examination were phoned to Dr. ___ on ___ at 12:56 p.m.
