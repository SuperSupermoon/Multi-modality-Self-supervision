The nasogastric tube deviates to the left at the level of the left mainstem bronchus; however, comparison to the most recent chest CT shows that the stomach is intrathoracic and positioned immediately below the left mainstem bronchus and therefore, the tip of the NGT likely resides within the stomach. The large opacity at the left lung base containing an air-fluid level represents the herniated stomach. The right lung is clear without focal opacity, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no focal opacity within the visualized portions of the left lung. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm. There is no acute osseous abnormality.
