As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no substantial change in tube position. The tip of the tube projects 4 cm above the carina. The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable. However, the tube could be advanced by approximately 5 cm to ensure safe position within the stomach. Apparently, the tip of the tube projects over the proximal parts of the stomach and the sidehole is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. Normal lung volumes. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis. No pneumothorax or other acute lung disease.
