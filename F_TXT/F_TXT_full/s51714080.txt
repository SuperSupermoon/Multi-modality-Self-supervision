The patient has been intubated and the tip of the ET tube terminates in the right main stem bronchus and should be retracted approximately 5 cm for appropriate positioning. There is interval opacification of the left lung base compatible with atelectasis. A small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. The right lung is relatively clear with interval improved opacity at the right lung base from the most recent prior study. No pneumothorax is detected. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema, which is unchanged. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated in the setting of left basilar opacification. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and stable with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and partial calcification of the aortic knob.
