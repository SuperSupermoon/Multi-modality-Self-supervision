Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Lung volumes are very low. New NG tube terminates in the upper chest at the level of the clavicles. Indistinctness of the vascular markings is compatible with pulmonary interstitial edema. Increased right hilar opacity is consistent with atelectasis. Atelectasis is also present at the lung bases. No pneumothorax. Heart size is normal.
