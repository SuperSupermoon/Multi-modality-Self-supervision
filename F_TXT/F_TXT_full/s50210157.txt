There has been interval appearance of opacity in the right upper and mid lung as well as increase in soft tissue in the right paratracheal and hilar region. When correlated with selected cross-sectional images as well as the scout image from the chest CT dated ___, some of these findings may reflect post radiation pneumonitis and lymphadenopathy, although it does appear that there is possibly increasing confluent opacity in the right upper lobe which would be concerning for superimposed infection. Clinical correlation is advised. The left lung is grossly clear. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated consistent with volume loss. There is likely a small right effusion. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
