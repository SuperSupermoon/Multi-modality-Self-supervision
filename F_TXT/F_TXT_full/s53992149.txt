The ET tube is 4.4 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is difficult to visualize but is at least in the stomach. There is a large left-sided pleural effusion with mediastinal shift to the right. There is a moderate right pleural effusion. There is pulmonary vascular re-distribution more marked on the left than on the right and hazy alveolar infiltrate, left greater than right. It is unclear how much of this is due to effusion layering posteriorly. Compared to the prior study, the left-sided effusion and mediastinal shift has increased.
