Comparison is made with prior study, CT abdomen performed a day earlier. There has been interval increase in size in large right effusion. Right lower lobe consolidation could be atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Small areas of atelectasis in the left lower lobe have increased. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac size is top normal. There are low lung volumes.
