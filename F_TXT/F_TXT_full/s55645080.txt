Allowing for differences in patient positioning, there has probably been no change in moderate bilateral pleural effusion, left-greater-than-right, since 8 a.m. this morning. Previous mild pulmonary edema has resolved. Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged. Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead is continuous from the new left pectoral generator. There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. Bibasilar atelectasis is still severe.
