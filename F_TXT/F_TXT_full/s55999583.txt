AP chest compared to ___: There is considerable subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall extending to the neck and upper abdomen. If there is left pneumothorax, it is small and only a small residual of left pleural fluid remains following insertion of a pair of pleural drainage catheters. Heart is mildly enlarged. Right lung is clear. It is also difficult to tell whether there may be a new air collection in the left upper abdominal quadrant. I would recommend a repeat radiograph within several hours, upright if possible, for that assessment. Dr. ___ ___ I discussed the findings at 2:15 p.m. just after the study was reviewed.
