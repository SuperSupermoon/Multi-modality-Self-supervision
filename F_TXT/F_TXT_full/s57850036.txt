Slightly rotated positioning. An NG tube is present -- the tip extends beneath the diaphragm. The configuration suggests that the NG tube is looped, probably within the stomach, with the extreme tip crossing itself to lie beneath the left hemidiaphragm, likely within the upper gastric fundus. The previously seen enteric tube is no longer visualized. The ET tube tip lies at the level of the lower clavicular heads, approximately 6.1 cm above the carina. A right IJ central line tip overlies the proximal/mid SVC. A left IJ central line lies near the tip of the proximal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary findings are similar to ___ at 04:06
