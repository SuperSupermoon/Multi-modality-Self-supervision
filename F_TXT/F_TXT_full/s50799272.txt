As compared to the previous radiograph, a pigtail catheter was inserted into the right pleural space. At the site of insertion, there is a basal pneumothorax of approximately 2-3 cm in diameter. The pre-existing effusion has almost completely resolved. At the base of the right lung, there are ill-defined opacities, which could be the result of re-expansion. There currently is no evidence of tension. The vascular stent in the vena cava is constant. Constant moderate cardiomegaly and normal appearance of the left lung.
