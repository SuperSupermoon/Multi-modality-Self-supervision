The endotracheal tube ends 4.4 cm from the carina, and the enteric tube extends outside of the field of view, both in standard position. Lung volumes are low causing bronchovascular crowding. Right mid and lower lung fields appear unchanged from the prior study of ___, with mildly improved aeration of the upper lung zones. The atelectasis and small to moderate pleural effusion at the left base appear slightly improved. There is mild cardiomegaly. Note is made of cervical fusion hardware.
