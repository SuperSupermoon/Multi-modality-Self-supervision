Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube has migrated to the lower trachea. Right IJ catheter tip is at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, shifted towards the right and with widened mediastinum. Right middle lobe and right lower lobe collapse is unchanged. Aeration of the right upper lobe has improved. Left upper and left lower lobe opacities have minimally improved. Pulmonary edema has almost resolved. There is no pneumothorax.
