Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not substantially changed from the prior study. The aorta remains mildly tortuous and diffusely calcified. Moderate alveolar pulmonary edema is worse in the interval with small bilateral pleural effusions noted. More focal opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
