The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Small quantities of subcutaneous emphysema are noted in soft tissues overlying the site of insertion of a chest tube into the left hemithorax. It has been pulled back somewhat but appropriately projects over the mid hemithorax, making a turn beyond the side holemarker. No detectable pneumothorax remains in the left hemithorax. Minimal opacification of the left lower lung is probably due to minor atelectasis. The right lung remains clear. There is no definite pleural effusion. Left-sided rib fractures are not well characterized.
