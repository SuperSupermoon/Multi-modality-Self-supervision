Re-identified is a left chest cardiac device with associated dual leads projecting over the right atrium and ventricle in unchanged, appropriate location. New since the prior exam is an enteric tube with distal tip projecting below the lower limit of the radiograph, however with side port seen projecting over the midline upper abdomen, difficult to definitively located however likely several cm distal to the GE junction. Clip projecting over the left hemithorax is likely extracorporeal. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, consistent with moderate cardiomegaly. The hilar within normal limits. Re-identified are multifocal airspace consolidations, most conspicuously affecting the medial right upper lobe and right lung base, partially visualized. Increased hazy opacification of the left lower lung is noted, possibly technical in nature. There is likely a small left pleural effusion. Findings consistent with mild pulmonary vascular congestion are seen, incompletely evaluated on this study. No pneumothorax is identified.
