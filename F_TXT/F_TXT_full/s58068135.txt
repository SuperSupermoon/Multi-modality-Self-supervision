Since the prior radiograph, the IABP has been removed. ET tube, NG tube, and left PICC line catheter are unchanged. A Swan-Ganz catheter tip is seen in the right main pulmonary artery. Again seen are bilateral diffuse hazy opacities with haziness at the bases, which could represent pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
