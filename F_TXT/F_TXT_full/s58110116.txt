AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are slightly smaller today than previously. The left lower lobe is obscured by a combination of heart and aorta with its metal stent. Recommend conventional chest radiographs because of better penetration and orthogonal lateral view to assess the lower lungs, particularly the left. Small left pleural effusion may be present. There is no pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly and stented thoracic aorta are unchanged.
