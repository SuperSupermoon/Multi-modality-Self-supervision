As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. Lung volumes have decreased, potentially reflecting decreased ventilatory pressures. As a consequence, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities have increased, notably at the lung bases and in the retrocardiac lung areas. There is no evidence of larger pleural effusions. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
