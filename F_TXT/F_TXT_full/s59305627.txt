As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. There is moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Minimal bilateral symmetrical apical thickening. The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable. The tube should be slightly advanced, given that the sidehole is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. No evidence of pneumonia or other pathologic parenchymal process. The endotracheal tube has been removed in the interval.
