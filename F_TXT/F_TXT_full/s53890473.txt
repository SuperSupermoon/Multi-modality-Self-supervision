An endotracheal tube is present with the tip 6 cm from the carina. The lung volumes are low. The left costophrenic angle is not included in the field of view. A large dense retrocardiac opacity is most likely atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. The apparent widening of the mediastinum is due to prominent mediastinal fat.
