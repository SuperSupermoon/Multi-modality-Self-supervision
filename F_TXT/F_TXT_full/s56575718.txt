There is little radiographic evidence on this frontal conventional chest radiograph of the moderate right pleural effusion demonstrated by chest CT performed 3 hours later but available the time of this review. Cardiomegaly is mild. Pulmonary vasculature is mild and mediastinal veins are mildly engorged but there is no edema. No pneumothorax. Left pic line ends in the upper right atrium on this study. It was repositioned in the upper SVC by the time of the subsequent chest CT scan.
