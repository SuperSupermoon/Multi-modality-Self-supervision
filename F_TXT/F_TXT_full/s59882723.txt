There is a new area of irregular, branching opacification in the right lower lobe, which may represent atelectasis or aspiration. The enteric tube and endotracheal tube are unchanged compared to the prior radiograph. Low lung volumes along with the patient supine positioning likely account for apparent pulmonary vascular crowding. No pleural abnormalities detected. The heart and mediastinum are normal appearing.
