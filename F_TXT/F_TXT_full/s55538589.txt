As compared to the previous radiograph, the left lung is substantially better expanded. Nevertheless, left blunting of the costophrenic sinus, presumably caused by a left pleural effusion, persists. There also is atelectasis at the left lung bases. Overall, low lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly. Bilateral surgical clips. Tracheostomy tube in situ.
