The new endotracheal tube terminates 7.6 cm from the carina. The enteric tube terminates within the proximal stomach with the side port at approximately the level of the GE junction. Evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma is limited by exclusion of the left chest from the field of view. The visualized lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
