Left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place in the lower left hemithorax. Large left pleural effusion with small hydropneumothorax components appears slightly larger than on the prior study, and is associated with substantial atelectasis of the adjacent left mid and lower lung regions. On the right, a new patchy opacity has developed at the right lung base, and may reflect atelectasis, aspiration, and less likely a developing pneumonia. Known mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy have been more fully characterized on recent CT of ___.
