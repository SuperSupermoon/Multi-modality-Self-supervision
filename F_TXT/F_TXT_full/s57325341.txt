Patient is status post median sternotomy and endovascular stent graft repair of the thoracic aorta at the level of the aortic arch due to a saccular aneurysm. Mediastinal contour appears unchanged. Heart size is mildly enlarged though difficult to definitively delineate due to the presence of a moderate-sized left pleural effusion. Small right pleural effusion is also unchanged. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
