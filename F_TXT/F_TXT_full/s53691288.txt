A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates multiple sternotomy wires, a mitral valve replacement, a Swan-Ganz catheter with the tip in the right pulmonary artery, and a left chest tube. The right pneumothorax is slightly decreased. The left pneumothorax is no longer appreciated. The remainder of the exam is grossly unchanged, with slight improvement of bibasilar atelectasis.
