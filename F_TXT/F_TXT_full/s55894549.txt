Evaluation of the study is limited due to rotation of the patient's low lung volumes and exclusion of the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax. Within this limitation, NG tube tip is in the stomach. There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. ET tube is in standard position with the tip 4.6 cm above the carina. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The main pulmonary arteries appear to be enlarged. Left perihilar opacities likely atelectasis. Attention in followup study is recommended in this area.
