Compared to the radiograph of 10:26 a.m. today, there has been interval re-expansion of the right lower and middle lobes. Persistent right lower lobe opacity is likely due to incomplete re-expansion. Left lower lobe collapse has worsened. The mediastinum is stable since the earlier study, with unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax. No change in the positioning of the multiple support lines and tubes, including the right PICC, Swan-Ganz catheter, right-sided pleural drain, and endotracheal tube. The NG tube has been advanced, with side-hole in the stomach. No pneumothorax.
