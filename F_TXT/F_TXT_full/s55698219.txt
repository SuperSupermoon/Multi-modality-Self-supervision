A frontal semi upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends 6.8 cm above the carina and could be advanced for better seating. The oral gastric tube ends in the stomach with the side port at the gastroesophageal junction and could be advanced. The left PICC ends in the upper SVC. Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. Bibasilar atelectasis has improved, but persists. Pulmonary edema has improved. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No pneumothorax.
