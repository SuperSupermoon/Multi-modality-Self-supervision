AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 11:09 a.m.: Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right, has improved on the right, remains stable on the left. Moderate pulmonary edema and moderately severe right basal atelectasis have both improved, left lower lobe collapse has not. Cardiac silhouette has been moderately enlarged since at least ___. There may well be an appreciable pericardial effusion, but there is no mediastinal venous engorgement to suggest that it is hemodynamically significant. Upper abdominal drains, ET tube, right internal jugular line, dual-channel left supraclavicular central venous line are in standard placements and a feeding tube passes into the duodenum and out of view. No pneumothorax is present.
