A spinal stimulator device projects over the base of the left neck and left hemithorax, as seen previously. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, allowing for differences in technique. There is hazy opacification of the left lung base which is nonspecific and could reflect atelectasis, but potentially pneumonia or aspiration, and potentially with a pleural effusion. There is also patchy non-specific right infrahilar opacity, which may be explained by atelectasis in association with new mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, although other etiologies such as pneumonia and aspiration cannot be excluded by this study. There is no pneumothorax.
