Single portable view of the chest. When compared to previous exam again seen is dense opacity in the right lung which has slightly progressed since prior with less aerated lung in the mid to lower regions. Underlying opacity is likely due to combination of known pleural-based metastatic disease noting new parenchymal opacity cannot be assessed. The left lung remains grossly clear. Widening of the upper mediastinum is in part due to medial pleural-based metastases. Cardiac silhouette cannot be assessed. No acute osseous abnormality detected.
