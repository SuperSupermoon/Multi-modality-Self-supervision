The endotracheal tube tip lies slightly high within the trachea, no less than 6.3 cm from the level of the carina. The lungs are well expanded though opacities in the apices remain likely represeting aspiration pneumonitis. Minimal residual atelectasis in the right base is improved from prior. There is no significant effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours remain normal.
