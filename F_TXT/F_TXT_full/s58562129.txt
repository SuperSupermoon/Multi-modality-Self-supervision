Single portable radiograph of the chest. There has been interval removal of right internal jugular catheter with the left PICC projecting into the right atrium. It should be pulled back by approximately 4 cm to be appropriately positioned in the low SVC. In comparison to the prior examination, there is otherwise no relevant change with similar lung volumes and no new consolidation identified. No pneumothorax is seen.
