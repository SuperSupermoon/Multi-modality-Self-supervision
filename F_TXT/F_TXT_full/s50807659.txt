Lung volumes are low, with the left lung less well expanded than the right, likely due to splinting. Rib fractures are better appreciated on the patient's recent CT. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size, the mediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
