There is the suggestion of a new triangular region of consolidation at the base, of the right lung and perhaps a small right pleural effusion. I would strongly recommend conventional chest radiographs, supplemented with oblique views if necessary to determine if there might be pneumonia or pulmonary infarction. Heart size is borderline enlarged, but there is no pulmonary edema.
