Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph was provided. Port-A-Cath again noted residing over the right mid chest with the catheter tip extending into the expected region of the superior vena cava. Lung volumes are quite low, which limits the evaluation. Bronchovascular crowding likely accounts for the left lung base opacity. No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The imaged osseous structures appear intact.
