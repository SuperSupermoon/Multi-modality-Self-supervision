The patient is status post midline sternotomy and CABG. There is pulmonary vascular congestion, without frank interstitial pulmonary edema. Heterogeneous right lower lung opacities are likely compressive atelectasis, although infection is not excluded. Minimal left retrocardiac atelectasis is slightly decreased. A moderate layering right pleural effusion is thought likely, slightly decreased in size. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is not significantly changed. Bulging of the hilar contours was seen to be marked lymphadenopathy on CT from ___. There is no change in the hilar contours to suggest that the degree of lymphadenopathy has increased.
