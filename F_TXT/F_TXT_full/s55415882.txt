The patient is rotated and the lung volumes are low which limits evaluation. There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis which have increased in size from prior. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. There certainly isn't evidence of severe pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. There is no displaced rib fracture.
