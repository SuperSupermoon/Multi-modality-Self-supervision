Tip of endotracheal tube terminates at the carina, directed towards the origin of the right main bronchus, as communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ at 9:45 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery. Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Asymmetrical right hilar enlargement is a persistent finding since ___, but has apparently increased when compared to older chest radiographs from ___ and although low lung volumes on a current study limit comparison. Lungs are clear except for linear bibasilar atelectasis. As recommended on chest ___ of ___, further evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT is suggested to better evaluate the right hilum if warranted clinically. This finding is also discussed with Dr. ___ as documented above.
