Comparison is made to prior study from ___. The endotracheal tube has been removed. There is a left-sided central venous catheter with distal lead tip in the mid SVC. This is unchanged. The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal but stable. There are again seen pleural effusions bilaterally, right side much greater than left. There has been mild improvement of pulmonary vascular prominence and there remains some hilar prominence at the right side which may be due to the vascular congestion. There are no pneumothoraces.
