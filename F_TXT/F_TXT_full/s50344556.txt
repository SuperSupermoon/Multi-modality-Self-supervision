Interval placement of a Dobbhoff feeding tube which has its tip at the gastroesophageal junction. The tube should be advanced at least 8-10 cm to ensure that is projecting within the stomach. Subsequent imaging on a study at 18:03 demonstrates the tube to be in satisfactory position. A left subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Lungs appear well inflated with linear opacity at the left base likely reflecting subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. No pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
