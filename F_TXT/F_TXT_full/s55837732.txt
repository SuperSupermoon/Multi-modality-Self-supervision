Again there is extensive subcutaneous emphysema which limits assessment. An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip is approximately 5 cm above the level of the carina. A right internal jugular catheter is in-situ. A right internal jugular catheter likely terminates in the right brachiocephalic vein. Diffuse patchy bilateral airspace opacities are similar to slightly improved in appearance when compared to the prior study. There appears to be 2 nasoenteric tubes, 1 terminates in the stomach, the other in the distal esophagus. 1 of these may be a monitoring device rather than a feeding tube. Correlation with the patient's history is recommended.
