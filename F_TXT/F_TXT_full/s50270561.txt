Bedside upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a new uniform opacity overlying the middle and lower right lung fields, through which normal bronchopulmonary structures can be seen. A more dense opacity at the left lung base obscures the left hemidiaphragmatic contour, and probably represents atelectasis. Stable, minimal widening of the mediastinum results from mediastinal vascular engorgement. Minimal pulmonary vascular engorgement is also unchanged. The heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax. An endotracheal tube terminates no less than 4.4 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular central venous catheter is appropriately positioned and unchanged. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view.
