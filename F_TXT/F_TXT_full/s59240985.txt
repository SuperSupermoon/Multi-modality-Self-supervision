A new enteric tube has been placed with weighted tip in the distal stomach. The cardiac silhouette is mildly prominent, accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes. Bibasilar consolidations are present. There is a dense retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis versus consolidation. There is increased vascular engorgement and mild edema. No pneumothorax.
