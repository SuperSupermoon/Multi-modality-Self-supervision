In comparison with the study of ___, there again are substantially low lung volumes. The pulmonary vascular congestion has substantially cleared. Atelectatic changes with pleural fluid are again seen on the right. On the left, the hemidiaphragm is quite sharp, though there is blunting of the costophrenic angle that could represent some pleural fluid associated with basilar atelectatic changes. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to definitely exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
