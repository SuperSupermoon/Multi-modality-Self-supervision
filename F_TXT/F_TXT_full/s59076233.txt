The ET tube is 1.7 cm above the carina, slightly low. The heart size is enlarged compared to the study from the prior day and there is pulmonary vascular redistribution and hazy alveolar infiltrates bilaterally. There are small bilateral effusions. There is dense retrocardiac opacity, compatible with volume loss/infiltrate. The overall impression is that of worsened CHF. NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach.
