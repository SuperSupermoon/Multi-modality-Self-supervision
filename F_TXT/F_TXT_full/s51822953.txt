Left lower lobe opacity has worsened since the recent radiograph and could reflect an evolving pneumonia given clinical suspicion for this entity. Newly developed right lower lobe opacity could reflect additional site of infection or, alternatively, focal aspiration or atelectasis. Allowing for relatively low lung volumes, exam is otherwise unchanged with persistent bilateral upper lobe bullous disease with adjacent confluent areas of fibrosis and scarring accompanied by calcified granulomas.
