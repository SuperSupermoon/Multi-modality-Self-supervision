An endotracheal tube is approximately 2.5 cm from the carina. A right internal jugular central line ends in the low SVC. A feeding tube is in the stomach with the tip out of view. Left lower lobe collapse and a moderate left pleural effusion are unchanged. There is no new consolidation, edema, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
