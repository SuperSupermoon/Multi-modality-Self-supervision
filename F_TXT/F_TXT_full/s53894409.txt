Right chest tube remains in place, with a persistent moderate right pneumothorax most prominent at the right lung base with a lesser right apical component. Overall, the size of the pneumothorax is similar, although this distribution has slightly changed. There remains extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall, loculated fluid at the right apex, and heterogeneous opacities in the right lung. Linear atelectasis is present at the left lung base as well as minimal scarring at the left apex; probable small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
