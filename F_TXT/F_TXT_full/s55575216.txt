There has been interval insertion of a left chest tube seen projecting over the left lateral lower lung, with significant interval improvement in the size of the now with small left pleural effusion. There has been interval re-expansion of much of the left lung, which appears clear. There is some residual opacification of the left lower lung likely related to small residual hydrothorax and adjacent left lower lung relaxation atelectasis. There has been interval resolution of rightward shift of mediastinal structures, now normal in appearance and location. The right lung remains clear. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
