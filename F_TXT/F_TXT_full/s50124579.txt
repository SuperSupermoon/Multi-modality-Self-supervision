AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior radiograph obtained the same day earlier. The NG tube tip is in the distal esophagus and should be repositioned. There is interval improvement in the right upper lobe atelectasis with still present opacity. The heart size in left of the mediastinum appears unchanged. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax currently demonstrated. The ET tube tip is 6.8 cm above the carina.
