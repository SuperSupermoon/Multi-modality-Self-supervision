Comparison is made to prior study from ___. The endotracheal tube tip has been advanced and the distal tip is now 2 cm above the carina. This could be pulled back 1 to 2 cm for more optimal placement. The tip is pointing towards the right mainstem bronchus. Heart size is enlarged but stable. There are persistent low lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings and atelectasis at the lung bases. No pneumothoraces or definite consolidation is present.
