No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart size top normal. Lungs are clear. A roughly elliptical ___ x 9 mm wide nodular opacity projecting over the medial right clavicle is probably at the azygos lobe in an azygos fissure, but because it could instead be any right upper lobe scar, recommend conventional PA and lateral chest radiograph and an AP lordotic frontal image 2 better characterize the finding. There are no radiographic findings detectable on this study, to suggest early pneumonia.
