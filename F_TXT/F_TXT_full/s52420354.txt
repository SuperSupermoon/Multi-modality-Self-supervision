-ET tube terminates 2.9 cm above the carina in grossly appropriate location. -Enteric tube courses inferiorly with distal tip projecting over the approximate location of the gastric body, with side port seen approximately 5.3 cm distal to the GE junction. -Unchanged appearance of bilateral diffuse airspace opacities, except for potential progression of left lower lobe atelectasis giving the left mediastinal shift slightly more pronounced than on the prior study. -Right-sided central venous line and PICC line are in unchanged position.
