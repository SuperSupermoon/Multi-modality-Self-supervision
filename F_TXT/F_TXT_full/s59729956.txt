AP chest compared to ___: Mild right basal atelectasis and small right pleural effusion, partially fissural, unchanged since ___, with the basal pleural tube is still in place. Moderate cardiomegaly has developed and pulmonary vasculature is more pronounced, mediastinal veins more dilated following extubation. This could represent either the effects of loss of positive pressure ventilator support or incipient cardiac decompensation, although there is no edema as yet. Small left pleural effusion is new.
