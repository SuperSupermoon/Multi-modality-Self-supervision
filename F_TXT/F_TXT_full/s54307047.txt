AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to multiple prior examinations with the chest CT obtained the same day earlier. The patient is after one lung intubation with the ET tube tip being in the left main bronchus, most likely reflecting selective intubation. The right chest tube is in place. The air collection in the right apex is related to prior surgery but should be closely followed. Bibasal areas of atelectasis are expected. Sutures in the left upper lobe are reflecting prior left upper lobe surgery.
