Frontal, upright portable radiograph of the chest was obtained. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not significantly changed from the prior study. There is increased convexity of the right mediastinal border which is more prominent than on prior study, but is similar in appearance to chest radiograph dated ___ at which time it was evaluated with chest CT, which demonstrated a prominent SVC accounting for the widened mediastinum. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with no evidence of pulmonary edema.
