Swan-Ganz catheter has been advanced to the region of the right ventricular outflow tract. Other indwelling devices are unchanged in position. Cardiac silhouette has slightly decreased in size and pulmonary edema has improved with mild residual interstitial edema remaining as well as a small right effusion. Bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with no visible pleural line to suggest pneumothorax. However, slightly deep left costophrenic sulcus associated with lucency in this region could potentially represent a basilar pneumothorax on this supine radiograph.
