1. Left-sided pacemaker in unchanged position. Overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours given marked patient rotation to the left on the current examination. Persistent patchy opacity in the right upper lobe consistent with pneumonia. However, there is increasing indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature which suggests superimposed mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. No pneumothorax. No large pleural effusions.
