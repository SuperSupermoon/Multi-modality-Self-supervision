AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Of note is that the PICC line currently is coiled most likely continuing into the azygos vein instead of SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged but there is slight interval increase in right pleural effusion as well as in left pleural effusion. Vascular engorgement is more pronounced and might be concerning for interval development of interstitial pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
