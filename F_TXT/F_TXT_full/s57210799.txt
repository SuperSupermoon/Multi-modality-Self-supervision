Recent left pleurodesis was done with two chest tubes in unchanged position. Left apical loculated air-fluid level measuring 2.2 x 6.1 cm has slightly increased in size since yesterday. The left lower lobe has not fully reexpanded. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are top normal. Right costal diaphragmatic pleural thickening is unchanged with minimal basilar atelectasis. A tiny line is seen in the right apex and could represent a tiny less than 3 mm pneumothorax. If this is real it is probably not significant in this patient with prior pleurodesis on this side.
