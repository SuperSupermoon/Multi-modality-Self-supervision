Evaluation is limited due to patient rotation. Additionally, the inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant bronchovascular crowding and accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is opacification of the left lung base greater than the right superimposed on background diffuse interstitial abnormality. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There are multiple right-sided rib fractures without significant callus formation, which are indeterminate in age.
