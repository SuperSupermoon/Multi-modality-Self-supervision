Patient is rotated to the right. There is a large area consolidation in the left mid to lower lung with some obscuration of the left heart border, likely involving at least the lingula, and possibly the left lower lobe. There is also evidence of bronchiectasis in region. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Right apical pleural thickening is again seen in this patient status post right upper lobectomy.
