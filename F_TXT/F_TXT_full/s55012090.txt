As compared to the previous image, there is no relevant change in position of the PICC line. The PICC line does not point up any more, but is still projecting with its tip over the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and the superior vena cava. No evidence of complications. The Dobbhoff catheter is in unchanged position.
