AP chest compared to ___: Moderate left pneumothorax and small collection of subcutaneous air in the left chest wall have each changed in distribution, not appreciably in size. Left lower lobe atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. New opacification in several areas of the right lung have returned, and because they mimic previous appearances are probably asymmetric edema rather than pneumonia. ET tube and a right PICC line and a feeding tube are in standard placements, respectively. No right pneumothorax.
