As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. There is an extensive left-sided pleural effusion that occupies approximately two-thirds of the left hemithorax. Effusion is accompanied by atelectasis. As compared to the previous image, the effusion is substantially more extensive. In the right lung, existing apical opacities have substantially decreased and the right upper lung is now normal. The right lung bases show increased parenchymal opacities, unchanged as compared to the previous examination, their morphology suggests atelectasis. No new parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
