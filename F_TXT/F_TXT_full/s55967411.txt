In comparison with study of ___, the cardiac silhouette remains within overall normal limits. Minimal indistinctness of pulmonary vessels raises the possibility of increased pulmonary venous pressure. There is suggestion of some increased opacification at the right base and in the retrocardiac region on this side. This could merely reflect crowded vessels or atelectasis and a lateral view would be ideal if clinically possible to better assess for possible pneumonia.
