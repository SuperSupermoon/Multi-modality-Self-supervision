Lung volumes are low. Again noted is a loculated right pleural effusion with component seen superolaterally as well as likely within the fissure. Associated atelectasis identified in the right lung noting that superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Known underlying lesion abutting the right hilum is not clearly delineated. There may also be a small left pleural effusion as well. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities.
