As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a substantial improvement with increased lung volumes and partial clearance of the pre-existing basal areas of atelectasis. The overall lung volumes, however, remain low. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No focal parenchymal opacities suspicious for pneumonia.
