Patchy retrocardiac opacity with suggestion of air bronchograms favors aspiration or pneumonia rather than atelectasis. Clinical correlation is recommended. Right medial basilar patchy opacity more consistent with atelectasis in the setting of an elevated right hemidiaphragm and decreased lung volume. Right internal jugular large bore catheter unchanged in position with its tip terminating in the right atrium. Left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the distal subclavian vein prior to the confluence with the SVC. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient rotation.
