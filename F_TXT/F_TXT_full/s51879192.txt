AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The study is analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. The previously present ___ line has been removed. With the exception of a remaining right internal jugular sheath, no other indwelling lines are noted. Heart size remains unchanged and is not significantly enlarged. Poor inspirational effort with relatively high positioned diaphragms explains crowded appearance of pulmonary vasculature on the bases, but no new parenchymal infiltrates are seen. Although the diaphragmatic contours are somewhat obscured, there is no evidence of pleural effusion obliterating the lateral pleural sinuses. No pneumothorax seen in the apical area.
