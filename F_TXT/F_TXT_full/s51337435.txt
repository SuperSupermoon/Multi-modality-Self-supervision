Persistent opacification at the lung bases is presumably combination of residual edema and atelectasis, but should be followed to exclude pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely. Heart size is normal, also decreased. No pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube and right jugular dual channel catheter in standard placements unchanged.
