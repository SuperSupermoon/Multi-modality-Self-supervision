CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW An ET tube is present, approximately 5.4 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A right IJ central line tip overlies the distal SVC. A right subclavian PIC line tip overlies the mid/distal SVC. Compared with earlier the same day at 19:13 p.m., the ET tube has been repositioned. Otherwise, I doubt substantial interval change.
