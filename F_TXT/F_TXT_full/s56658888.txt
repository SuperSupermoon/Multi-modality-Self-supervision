Compared with prior radiographs, there is a new focal consolidation in the right middle lobe, concerning for pneumonia, likely aspiration given the clinical setting. Central pulmonary vascular congestion, bilateral pleural effusions, and pulmonary edema are slightly increased. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to evaluate due to underlying thoracic dextroscoliosis and suboptimal patient positioning. Long tubular structure is noted to run across the entire field of view, presumably outside the patient.
