Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 9:18 and 5:00 p.m. Current radiograph demonstrates overall unchanged appearance of the left lower lung opacity and associated pleural effusion. Right basal opacity appears to be overall unchanged as well, most likely caused by layering pleural fluid. The Port-A-Cath catheter is unchanged in appearance. There is no pneumothorax.
