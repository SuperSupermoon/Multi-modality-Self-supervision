As compared to the previous radiograph, the aortic balloon pump has been removed. The other monitoring and support devices, including the Swan-Ganz catheter, are unchanged. The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter should be pulled back by approximately 4 cm. The previous patch projecting over the cardiac silhouette is no longer visible. Unchanged moderate pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion with subsequent areas of atelectasis at the left lung base. No evidence of pneumothorax.
