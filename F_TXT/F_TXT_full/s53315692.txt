Again seen is relatively pronounced cardiomegaly and prominence of the pulmonary hila, similar to the prior film. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, without other evidence of CHF. Platelike atelectasis again noted in the right mid zone, slightly more extensive. The right costophrenic angle is not well visualized and the possibility of a small right pleural effusion, new compared with the prior study, cannot be excluded. Left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film. Some increased retrocardiac opacity is again seen, with minimal atelectasis at the lateral left lung base. An NG/Oro-gastric type tube is present, extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film. Clips noted in the right supraclavicular region.
