Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient rotation between studies. There continues to be small layering effusion with improved aeration at both lung bases since the prior study. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity right mid lung has resolved and likely reflected atelectasis. Nodular opacity left upper lobe again seen.
