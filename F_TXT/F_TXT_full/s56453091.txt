As compared to the previous radiograph, the ventilation of the left lung parenchyma has substantially increased, resulting in an increase in transparency, notably in the retrocardiac lung areas. On the right, the pre-existing basal opacity is constant in position but has also slightly decreased in severity. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
