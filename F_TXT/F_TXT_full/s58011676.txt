Portable AP semi-upright radiograph is presented for review. Endotracheal tube terminates 5.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of view. Improved aeration is seen in the left base with some minimal residual atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is seen without findings of edema. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
