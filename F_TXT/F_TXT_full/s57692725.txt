Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and chest CT obtained the same day. Extensive consolidations are primarily involving right upper lobe as well as left upper and left lower lobe with relative sparing of the right lower lobe to some extent. The consolidations are extensive associated with small amount of pleural fluid and when compared to prior chest radiograph appear to be progressing in particular in density as well as in involvement of additional lobes such as progression of the right lower lobe and left lower lobe involvement. Apices are still spared from the infectious process. No pneumothorax is seen.
