The patient is status post prior median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery. Heart remains enlarged and is accompanied by worsening bilateral heterogeneous opacities, which probably reflect pulmonary edema although underlying infection is possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Small bilateral pleural effusions are not appreciably changed.
