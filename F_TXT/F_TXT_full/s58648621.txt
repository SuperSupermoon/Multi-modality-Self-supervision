Compared to chest radiograph from 4 hours earlier, there has been interval placement of a orogastric tube that passes into the stomach and out of view. No evidence of pneumothorax. Bibasilar opacities have minimally improved. The contribution of asymmetric edema and pneumonia to these opacities is hard to say. There is little change otherwise.
