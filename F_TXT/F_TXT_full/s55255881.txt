Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. The lung volumes are low. There is very subtle opacity at the medial right lung base which could represent a confluence of bronchovasculature though in the correct clinical setting an early consolidation is difficult to exclude. Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. The heart and mediastinal contour appears normal. The imaged osseous structures appear intact.
