Slightly rotated positioning. Right IJ central line is again seen, with tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction. The difference in position of the line in relation to the cardiac silhouette is likely accounted for by rotation. An NG type 2 with radiopaque tip is now present, with tip beneath the diaphragm, overlying the stomach. Inspiratory volumes are slightly low. Allowing for this, diffuse patchy opacities are again seen throughout both lungs, overall similar in appearance. Also again seen is increased retrocardiac density, compatible left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. No effusion or pneumothorax detected.
