An NG-type tube is present, the tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film. An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. A right IJ sheath is present. A right subclavian PICC line is present, the tip is not optimally delineated, but likely lies in the region of the distal SVC/RA junction. Rotated positioning. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably stable. Vascular plethora and blurring is consistent with interstitial edema. Increased retrocardiac density is consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. No gross effusion, though small effusions would be difficult to exclude.
