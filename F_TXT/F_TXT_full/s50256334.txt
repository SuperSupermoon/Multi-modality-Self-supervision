AP chest compared to postoperative chest radiographs on ___: Transient increase in mediastinal caliber between 3:11 p.m. and 7:36 p.m. on ___ has reversed. Though this was due to mediastinal vascular engorgement or blood or fluid accumulation is radiographically indeterminate, but there is no evidence of undrained bleeding currently. Mild pulmonary edema has also improved. Lung volumes remain low, due in part to restrictive pleural thickening, partially calcified. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Midline and pleural drains, endotracheal tube are in standard placements. Enteric drainage tube is looped in the hypopharynx and then passes as far as the lower esophagus with the tip is obscured. Similarly, a Swan-Ganz catheter is traceable as far as pulmonary outflow tract, and probably passes beyond to the right pulmonary artery, as it did yesterday. No pneumothorax. ___ was paged, 8:32 a.m., one minute following recognition of the findings. At 9:10 he instructed me to page ___, who replied at 9:30, when we discussed the findings by telephone.
