Lung volumes are markedly low which accentuates bronchovascular markings. A right internal jugular catheter is in stable position. Drainage tubes overlie the chest in similar position to the prior examination. Bibasilar opacities are re- demonstrated and likely reflect atelectasis. There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt edema. No pneumothorax.
