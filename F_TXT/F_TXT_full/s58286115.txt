Although there are no recent prior chest radiographs, the study is read in conjunction with the chest CTA performed on ___ showing extensive pulmonary emboli, large left hilar mass infiltrating mediastinum, left pleural effusion, lung nodules and probable pulmonary infarcts, all visible on this chest radiograph. Today's chest radiograph shows that the heart is normal size and the right lung shows no pulmonary edema. The left lung is partially obscured by pleural effusion and probable worsening left lower lobe atelectasis. Mild edema in the upper lobe is a function of Lymphovenous congestion by the left hilar mass. No pneumothorax.
