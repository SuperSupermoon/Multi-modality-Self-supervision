Compared to the prior study there is increased opacity at the right base with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm. It is unclear how much of this is due to volume loss in how much of that is due to a E right lower lobe infiltrate. There is also dense retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. This is increased slightly compared to the prior exam. There is mild pulmonary vascular redistribution. The left IJ line and left-sided PICC line tips are unchanged. .
