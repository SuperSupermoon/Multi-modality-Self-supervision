Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right internal jugular port-a-cath and endotracheal tube are unchanged in position. There continues to be a stable hazy opacity at the right apex. Unchanged patchy and streaky opacities at both lung bases could reflect areas of atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. More focal nodular opacity in the right mid lung likely corresponds to the presumed pulmonary contusion seen on the CT dated ___. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Old left-sided rib fractures again seen.
