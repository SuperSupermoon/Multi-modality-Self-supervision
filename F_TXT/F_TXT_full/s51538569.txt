Assessment is limited by patient positioning and rotation. Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in similar positions. Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta are re- demonstrated with diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications noted within the aorta. Hilar contours are difficult to assess given the degree of patient rotation. Patchy opacity in the left lung base could reflect an area of atelectasis. Additional focal opacity is seen within the right mid lung field. No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly visualized on this supine exam. Osseous structures are diffusely demineralized with loss of height of several mid thoracic vertebral bodies.
