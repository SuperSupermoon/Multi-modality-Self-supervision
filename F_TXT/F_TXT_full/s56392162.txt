Since 1 day prior, there has been substantial improvement in pulmonary edema, moderate at the right apex and mild elsewhere. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. The left costophrenic angle is not visualized, but there is no right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Substantial retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged. An ET tube terminates 5.3 cm above the carina. A right-sided IJ Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the proximal right pulmonary artery. An enteric tube passes into the stomach.
