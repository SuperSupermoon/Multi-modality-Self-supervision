Single frontal view of the chest. Endotracheal tube terminates 5.5 cm above the carina. The NG tube is in stable position with its side port at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. Right subclavian central venous catheter has been removed. Consolidation of right middle and right lower lobe as well as heterogeneous consolidation of left lower lung are similar to prior and consistent with multifocal pulmonary masses with possible superimposed pneumonia as seen on the prior CT. Moderate right pleural effusion is small left pleural effusion persists. No pneumothorax. Heart borders are difficult to delineate due to marked lung parenchymal abnormalities.
