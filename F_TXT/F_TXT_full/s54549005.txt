Single portable view of the chest. Large right-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis is again seen and given differences in positioning and technique has not significantly changed. There is no visualized pneumothorax. The left lung remains grossly clear. Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess given silhouetting on the right. Slightly tortuous descending thoracic aorta is noted.
