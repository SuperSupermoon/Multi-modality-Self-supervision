As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. Size of the cardiac silhouette remains slightly enlarged and small pleural effusions are seen bilaterally. In addition, there is evidence of mild interstitial fluid overload as well as a new parenchymal opacity at the medial aspects of the right lung bases, potentially reflecting early pneumonia. Overall, the findings would be consistent with a combination of fluid overload and early pneumonia. It was delivered at the time of image acquisition.
