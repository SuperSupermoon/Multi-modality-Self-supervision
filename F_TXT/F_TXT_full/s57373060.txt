AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. There is opacity at the left lung base which is similar to what was seen on yesterday's radiograph, likely representing a combination of consolidation and effusion. Overall, there may be slight interval worsening. The right lung remains clear. Otherwise, no change. Skin ___ are noted in the right base of neck.
