Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of bronchovascular markings. This study is mildly underpenetrated due to body habitus. Trace left pleural effusion cannot be completely excluded. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. Cardiac and mediastinal contours may be mildly accentuated by low lung volumes.
