In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the opacification of the left base that is most consistent with atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. On the views presented, there is no evidence of nasogastric tube. The chin of the patient overlies the lower cervical region, so the possibility of a tube coiled in the neck cannot be excluded on this study.
