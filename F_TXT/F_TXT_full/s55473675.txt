ET tube tip lies approximately 7.7 cm above the carina, at the lower edge of the medial clavicular heads. NG tube tip overlies the left upper quadrant. A sideport, if present, does not extend beyond the GE junction. Right IJ central line tip overlies the proximal/mid SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for technical differences. Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, slightly denser. A small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. Minimal patchy at the right low minimal minimal patchy opacity at the right lung base is also again seen, similar prior. No pneumothorax detected. Doubt overt CHF.
