Endotracheal tube terminates 2.2 cm above the level of the carina. The balloon of the ET tube is mildly hyperinflated. Lung volumes are extremely low. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with large opacity filling the remainder of the right lung. Differential considerations include pneumonia, hemorrhage, contusion, and less likely asymmetric pulmonary edema. A linear opacity within the right lung base may reflect a focus of subsegmental atelectasis. Haze over the left lung may be related to mild edema. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal contours are difficult to evaluate due to an external device projecting over the lower thoracic spine. There is suggestion of possible retrocardiac opacity which may be related to hiatal hernia. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are mildly enlarged, may be related to low lung volumes and AP technique.
