Portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable positioning of medical devices. Nasogastric tube was seen coursing out of view; side port not demonstrated on current image. Endotracheal tube tip position difficult to evaluate but appears approximately 3 cm from the carina. There is stable mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis. The appearance of decreased small left pleural effusion likely reflects patient positioning given short time period. PICC line located in the upper right atrium.
