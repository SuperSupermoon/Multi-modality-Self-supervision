The lungs are grossly clear without consolidation noting that the left lung apex is obscured by patient's face. Opacity at the left lung base laterally is compatible with prominent fat pad seen on prior CT. Chronic underlying parenchymal changes are noted, particularly noted at the right upper lung. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Enlarged pulmonary arteries are again noted as well as dense atherosclerotic calcification in the thoracic aorta which is tortuous.
