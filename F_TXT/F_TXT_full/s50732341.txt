The patient is status post recent median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery, with stable post-operative appearance of cardiomediastinal contours. Large left and small to moderate right pleural effusions are again demonstrated, with apparent slight decrease in the left effusion and slight increase in the right effusion. Adjacent basilar lung opacities are again demonstrated, likely representing atelectasis adjacent to the effusions.
