CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Compared with prior film from ___ at 19:03 pm, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been retracted. The tip now overlies the expected origin of the right main pulmonary artery. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Mediastinal drains and bilateral chest tubes again noted. No pneumothorax detected. Mild vascular plethora/interstitial edema is essentially unchanged.
