No focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. Subtle rounded opacity projecting over the left lower hemi thorax may represent nipple shadow. This could be confirmed with repeat with nipple markers. Bilateral spinal rods are partially imaged and not optimally assessed on this study, however, no obvious spinal rod fracture is seen. No pulmonary edema.
