As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Normal lung volumes with borderline size of the cardiac silhouette and mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Left pectoral pacemaker in situ. Leads positioned in the right atrium and right ventricle. Bilateral hilar enlargement, likely caused by dilated pulmonary arteries. However, coexisting adenopathy cannot be excluded and could be confirmed with CT. No pneumothorax, no pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumonia.
