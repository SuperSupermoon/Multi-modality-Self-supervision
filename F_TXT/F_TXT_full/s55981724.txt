Comparison is made with prior study ___. ET tube has been advanced, now it is in standard position approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Right lower lobe aeration has improved. There are persistent opacities in the left lower lobe, these could be atelectasis, but superimposed aspiration/pneumonia cannot be excluded. Widened mediastinum is unchanged. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Sternal wires are aligned. Cardiomegaly is stable. Healed right rib fracture is again noted.
