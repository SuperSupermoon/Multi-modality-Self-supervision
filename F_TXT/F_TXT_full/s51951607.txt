As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal jugular vein catheter and the endotracheal tube are in unchanged position. The lung volumes have slightly decreased, causing a slight atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions. The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal but no pulmonary edema is seen. No focal opacities suggesting pneumonia. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
