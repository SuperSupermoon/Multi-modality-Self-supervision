Again the cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal and there is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm suggests pleural fluid with some atelectatic changes at the base. Although no definite acute focal pneumonia is appreciated, in the appropriate clinical setting this would be difficult to exclude, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
