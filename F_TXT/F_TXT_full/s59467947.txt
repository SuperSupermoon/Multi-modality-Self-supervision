Large intra-abdominal free air. Lung volumes are low without focal consolidation. Relative crowding of the interstitial markings and bronchovascular structures likely secondary to low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
