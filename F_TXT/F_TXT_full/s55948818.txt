Left-sided PICC is no longer seen. Right-sided Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating at the proximal right atrium. Midline tracheostomy is again seen. Aortic endograft is grossly stable in position. There are relatively low lung volumes with areas of patchy opacity in the left mid to lower lung and to a lesser extent in the right mid-to-lower lung which appear significantly improved as compared to ___, but persistent. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may be due to a small pleural effusion. Trace left pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable.
