As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The Swan-Ganz catheter is also removed but a right internal jugular vein introduction sheet remains in situ. As expected, the lung volumes have decreased, but there is no evidence of larger pleural effusions, no pneumonia or pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
