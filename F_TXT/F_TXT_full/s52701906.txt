There has been no appreciable change in the right hemithorax for several days. The right lung is still collapsed, the parietal pleural surface severely thickened, and the pleural space contains mostly air and some effusion, despite the presence of a right pleural drainage catheters. Left PIC line ends in the lower SVC. The predominately basal interstitial pulmonary abnormality in the left lung has worsened over the past several days, and the rapid onset suggests it is mostly edema but the nodular quality suggests some disseminated carcinomatosis. Heart size is indeterminate.
