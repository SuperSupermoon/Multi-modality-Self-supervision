In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a Dobhoff tube that extends at least to the upper stomach were crosses the lower margin of the image. Cardiac silhouette is unchanged. However, there has been engorgement of increasingly indistinct pulmonary vessels, consistent with worsening pulmonary vascular congestion. The right hemidiaphragm has been obscured, consistent with development of pleural effusion and substantial volume loss in the right lower lobe. The right heart border is still sharply seen, so that the middle lobe is probably non involved. Mild atelectatic changes seen at the left base. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude aspiration, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
