1. Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip in the right pulmonary artery, unchanged. Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet in satisfactory position. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm. There is blunting of left costophrenic angle with some retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting a small effusion with patchy compressive atelectasis. Pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Improving with residual minimal interstitial edema. Left upper and mid calcified nodules likely reflect granulomata. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
