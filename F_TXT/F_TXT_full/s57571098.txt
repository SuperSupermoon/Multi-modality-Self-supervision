The tracheostomy tube position cannot be confirmed on this exam. Again seen is extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the lateral chest wall, pectoralis muscles and cervical regions bilaterally, overall slightly improved compared to the prior exam. There is mild pneumomediastinum, overall improved compared to the prior exam. Underlying coarse interstitial pulmonary markings are again noted. There appears to be bilateral unchanged diffuse reticulonodular interstitial process with a more focal airspace confluent opacity at the right apex. The lungs remain hyperinflated. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are otherwise stable. Chain sutures at the left apex are again noted. Again noted is pneumomediastinum. The right basilar pneumothorax appears to have improved compared to the prior exam. There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
