The patient has been extubated in the interval. An enteric catheter terminates in the stomach. A right central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. Basilar opacities, left greater than right, likely related to atelectasis have increased. There is no evidence of interstitial pulmonary edema. A probable small left pleural effusion is also mildly increased. No pneumothorax is evident. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
