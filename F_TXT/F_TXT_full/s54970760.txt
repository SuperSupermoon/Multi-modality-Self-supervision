Interval removal of mediastinal and chest tubes with no obvious pneumothorax identified, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. Status post median sternotomy with stably enlarged postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Interval appearance of asymmetric mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. Probable small left effusion.
