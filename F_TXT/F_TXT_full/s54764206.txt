AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding AP and lateral chest examination of ___. Status post sternotomy and bypass surgery, presence of left-sided permanent pacer with three intracavitary electrodes, two of which terminating in right atrial area and the third in right ventricular area. They all appear unchanged. The pulmonary congestive pattern, mild degree of pulmonary vascular distention and prominent vasculature in upper pulmonary compartments (upper zone re-distribution pattern)also appear unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature again appears crowded in the bases, apparently related to the relatively high-positioned diaphragms and poor inspirational effort. There is no evidence of acute parenchymal infiltrates or signs of pleural effusion blunting the lateral pleural sinuses as can be identified on a single view chest examination. No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area.
