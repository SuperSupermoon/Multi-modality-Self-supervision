In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 6.9 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube again extends well into the stomach. There are again bilateral layering pleural effusions, more prominent on the right with compressive atelectasis at the bases. The possibility of supervening pneumonia, especially at the right base, cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. The right IJ catheter has been removed. The left lung is essentially clear.
