1. Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian central line are unchanged in position. There has been some interval improvement in aeration with patchy heterogeneous opacities in both lungs being slightly less apparent. Right hemidiaphragm remains elevated, of uncertain etiology and significance. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No large effusions or pneumothoraces. Compared to prior studies dating back to ___, there is likely no significant interval change given differences in technique, positioning and aeration.
