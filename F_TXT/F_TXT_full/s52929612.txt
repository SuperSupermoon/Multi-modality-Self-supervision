As compared to the previous radiograph, there has been placement of a Minnesota tube. The tube follows the course of the esophagus and is located with its tip in the stomach. The endotracheal tube and the right internal jugular vein catheter are constant. The pre-existing nasogastric tube has been removed. The right lung appears unchanged. On the left, the lateral parts of the hemithorax are missing on today's image. However, the visualized parts of the image appear unchanged.
