Single portable view of the chest. No prior. There is retrocardiac opacity which silhouettes the medial hemidiaphragm and descending aorta. Increased pleural-based opacity seen laterally at the left lung base. This could potentially be due to an effusion. Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, potentially accentuated by technique. Posterior thoracic/lumbar spinal fixation hardware is seen with midline surgical ___. Anterior cervical fixation hardware is also seen. There is apparent erosion of the distal aspect of the right clavicle which is incompletely evaluated.
