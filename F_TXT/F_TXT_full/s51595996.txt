Patient is rotated severely to the right, and although the right hemidiaphragm obscures the right lower lobe, the remainder of the right lung is clear. On the left however, partially obscured by external devices, is interstitial abnormality, perhaps gravitational edema. I would recommend repeat radiography when feasible, carefully positioned, to see if there is a developing abnormality in the left lung such as aspiration pneumonia.
