A VP shunt is seen coursing through the right hemithorax into the right abdomen. Tracheostomy tube is noted. Though this study is not intended for evaluation of the airway, the trachea does not appear much larger than the tracheostomy tube. A Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen coursing into the proximal duodenum. IVC filter projects over the right border of the L2 and L3 vertebral bodies. Large mass in the right upper lung causes rightward tracheal deviation but is better assessed on the prior chest CT. Marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted, with resultant right basal atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is noted.
