Comparison is made with CT torso on ___. ET tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. There are low lung volumes. Cardiac size is top normal. Widened mediastinum is due to lymphadenopathy better seen in prior CT. There is no evident pneumothorax. There is mild vascular congestion. There is a stable small left pleural effusion. Well-defined rounded hyperlucency in the left lower lobe is better characterized in prior CT. It could be due to a bulla , less likely lung laceration.
