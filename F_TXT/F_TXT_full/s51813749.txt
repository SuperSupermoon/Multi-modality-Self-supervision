Lung volumes are low, with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Even accounting for this, there is likely mild pulmonary vascular engorgement, though there is no frank pulmonary edema. There is no effusion or pneumothorax, and there is no parenchymal opacity to suggest pneumonia. Heart is top normal in size, exaggerated by low volumes and portable technique.
