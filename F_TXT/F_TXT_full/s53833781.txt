In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again, there is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with atelectatic or fibrotic streaks above it. Less prominent atelectatic change is seen at the right base. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
