Interval placement of right-sided chest tube terminating at the level of the right sixth posterior rib, with a persistent small right apical pneumothorax at the level of the right third posterior rib level. Multiple contiguous rib fractures are present from the second to the seventh rib level, including at least one segmental fracture, concerning for flail chest. Widespread consolidation in the right lung has slightly worsened, and persistent subcutaneous emphysema is also demonstrated. Circular lucencies in the right mid and lower lung are consistent with pulmonary laceration injury. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique. Left lung and pleural surfaces are clear. Additional traumatic injuries are demonstrated with the right clavicular and scapular fractures, shown to better detail on CT.
