Apparent widening of the mediastinum is continuous with thickened left apical pleural margin, obscuring the aortic knob. This may represent either widened mediastinum due to bleeding or extravasation or pleural fluid tracking superiorly in the supine patient. Of note a large vascular introducer has been removed from the left neck and upper mediastinum since ___:00 and could be a source of bleeding. . There is increased interstitial opacities and fullness of the pulmonary vasculature. New right ground-glass perihilar opacity could be edema or aspiration. There is left lower lobe collapse with leftward mediastinal shift and large left pleural effusion. Small pleural effusion on the right is also likely. The nasogastric tube is coiled in the hypopharynx and terminates in the upper stomach. Right-sided introducer, ETT and left-sided PICC appear unchanged in position.
