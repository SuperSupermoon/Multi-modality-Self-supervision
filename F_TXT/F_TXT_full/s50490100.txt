There appears to be interval worsening of the bilateral perihilar opacities. There are small stable bilateral pleural effusions. There is stable moderate cardiomegaly. Mild bibasilar atelectasis appears to have increased. There is a right-sided PIC line, which appears slightly retracted compared to the prior exam; however, appears to terminate the mid SVC. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
