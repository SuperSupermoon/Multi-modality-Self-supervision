In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much poorer inspiration. Specifically, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is some hazy opacification at the right base that could reflect the primary process that was biopsied or some adjacent hemorrhage. There is opacification of the costophrenic angle on the right, which could reflect fluid within the pleural space. The upper lobes are clear and there is no vascular congestion.
