The patient is intubated. A orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its distal extent not visualized. The mediastinum is widened, including about the periaortic region. A chest tube terminates in the right hemithorax. There is potentially a small pneumothorax on the right. There is extensive retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe which may be due to partial collapse of the left lower lobe. Pleural effusions are difficult to exclude, particularly on the left, but not explicitly demonstrated. Substantial subcutaneous emphysema about the course of the right-sided chest tube is noted along the right lateral chest wall.
