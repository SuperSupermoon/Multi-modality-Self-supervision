Lordotic positioning. Lungs are overinflated, consistent with COPD. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for differences in positioning Again seen is dense opacity in the lower third of left lung, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with suspected left pleural effusion. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured. On the right, there is minimal patchy opacity at the right base which is new, question atelectasis, no focus of aspiration or early pneumonic infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is again seen, possibly slightly more pronounced. Otherwise, the right lung is grossly clear. Again seen is hazy opacity in an incomplete azygos lobe in the right upper zone medially. This area was clear on the ___ CT scan and the apparent hazy density may be due to overlap of the right paratracheal soft tissues. There is upper zone redistribution mild vascular plethora, without other evidence of CHF.
