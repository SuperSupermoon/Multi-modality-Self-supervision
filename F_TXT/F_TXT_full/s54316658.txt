Volume and aeration in the left lung have improved substantially since ___ in both upper and lower lobes although consolidation is still more pronounced superiorly. There is also the suggestion of a confluent opacity at the apex either in the long or pleura or both. It would be reasonable to perform a chest CT when feasible. Right lung aside from the region of apical lung and pleural scarring is normal. Pleural effusion is small on the left if any. Heart is normal size. Ascending Swan-Ganz catheter tip projects at or just beyond the level of the pulmonic valve. Nasogastric tube is coiled in the stomach. ECMO venous cannula extends from the IVC to the mid SVC. ET tube in standard placement. No pneumothorax.
