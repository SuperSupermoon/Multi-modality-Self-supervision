AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 1:30 p.m.: No left pneumothorax or pleural effusion has developed since ___, 1:30 p.m. following removal of the left pleural drainage catheter. Lung volumes remain generally low, with more atelectasis developing at the right lung base. Right PICC line ends in the mid-to-low SVC, right jugular sheath alongside the dual-channel left supraclavicular central venous line at the origin of the SVC. No ET tube or enteric drainage tube is seen. Pleural effusion is small if any and there is no indication of pneumothorax. Mild postoperative widening of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Given low lung volumes, pulmonary vascular caliber is acceptable. No definite pulmonary edema.
