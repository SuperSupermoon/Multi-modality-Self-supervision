Lung volumes are low. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. A 3.5 x 5.7 cm right paratracheal well-circumscribed mass is identified, as well as a 5.5 x 3.1 cm left paramediastinal lesion. The trachea appears slightly narrowed as a result of these masses. Hilar contours are unremarkable, and no pulmonary vascular congestion is seen. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis or infection. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated. S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is present.
