In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged with diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications most likely reflecting pulmonary edema. The possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Bilateral layering pleural effusions with basilar atelectasis are seen. The monitoring and support devices remain in place with the tip of the endotracheal tube approximately 6 cm above the carina.
