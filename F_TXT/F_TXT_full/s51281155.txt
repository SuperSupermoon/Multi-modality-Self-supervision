Low bilateral lung volumes with bilateral lower lobe opacities likely reflective of atelectasis and/or consolidation. There is vascular crowding which may be secondary to mild pulmonary vascular congestion or low bilateral lung volumes. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. The size of the cardiac silhouette is marked to be enlarged.
