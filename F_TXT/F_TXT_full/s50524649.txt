Single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right-sided central venous catheter terminating in the mid SVC. Mediastinal and pleural drains are stable in position. There is persistent but improved bilateral patchy opacifications, which may represent resolving background pulmonary edema; however, there is a persistent, though again slightly improved, opacity within the right upper lobe and left mid lung, which may suggest superimposed pneumonia. No pleural effusion identified. No definite pneumothoraces are noted.
