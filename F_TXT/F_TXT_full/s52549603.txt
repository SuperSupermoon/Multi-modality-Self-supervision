As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube and the Swan-Ganz catheter were removed. Also removed is the left chest tube. There is a small right apical pneumothorax but no convincing evidence is seen for a left pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly. No pleural effusions.
