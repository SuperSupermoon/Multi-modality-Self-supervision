A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph is obtained. The endotracheal tube tip remains 4 cm above the carina. An enteric catheter passes out of the field of view. A right pleural catheter is in unchanged position. Central pulmonary vasculature congestion has worsened since the prior exam 24 hours ago, contributing to apparent mediastinal widening. Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged. A moderate left and small right pleural effusion is similar.
