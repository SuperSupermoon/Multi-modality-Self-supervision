Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 8 cm above the carina and should be further advanced for optimal placement. There is interval placement of an enteric tube projecting over the stomach, tip not imaged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis are noted. The lungs are otherwise clear.
