Again seen is a pigtail type chest tube at the base of the left lung. No pneumothorax is detected. As before, there are increased markings in left upper zone, with faint density correspond to the known spiculated mass there. Associated with this, there is poor definition of the left superior hilum. Also again seen is increased density at to left base. This could represent a combination of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and possible small amount pleural fluid. The appearance is similar, possibly slightly worse, compared 1 day earlier. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base again noted. Otherwise, the right lung is grossly clear. No CHF or focal infiltrate identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged .
