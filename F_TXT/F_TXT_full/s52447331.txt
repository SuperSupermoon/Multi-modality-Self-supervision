In comparison with the study of ___, the area of increased opacification in the left upper and mid zone has substantially cleared. This could reflect resolution of asymmetric pulmonary edema or possibly resolving aspiration. The left hemidiaphragm is not as well seen as on the previous study, raising the possibility of volume loss in the left lower lobe. Otherwise, little change.
