AP portable supine chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes. An endotracheal tube, its tip which terminates 4 mm above the level of the carina in appropriate position. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. Heart size is exaggerated secondary to the lung volumes. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is likely sequela of atelectasis. There is mild bronchovascular crowding. No air under the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
