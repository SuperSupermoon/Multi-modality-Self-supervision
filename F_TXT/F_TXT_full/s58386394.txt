AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The ET tube tip is approximately 8 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinum is widened, reason is unclear, potentially due to mediastinal lipomatosis, but additional causes cannot be excluded and correlation with prior imaging with chest CT might be considered. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
