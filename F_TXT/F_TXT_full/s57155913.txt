As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone left thoracocentesis. There is no evidence of a post-procedural pneumothorax. The pleural effusion on the left has substantially decreased, but is still present at the level of the costophrenic sinuses. Massive hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well as cardiomegaly and heterogeneities along the ribs and in the bones are present in unchanged manner.
