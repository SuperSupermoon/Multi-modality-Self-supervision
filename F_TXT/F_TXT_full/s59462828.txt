Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette normal in size and the aorta calcified and tortuous. Ovoid calcification projecting over the lateral right lower lung is stable. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, evidence of pneumothorax is seen. There is no overt pulmonary edema. Partially imaged are degenerative changes at the bilateral glenohumeral joints.
