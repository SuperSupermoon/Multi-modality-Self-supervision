The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette enlarged. Prominence of the hila is again seen which may be due to combination of adenopathy and enlarged pulmonary arteries. There is subtle diffuse increase in interstitial markings bilaterally which may relate to mild edema and/ or chronic lung disease. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
