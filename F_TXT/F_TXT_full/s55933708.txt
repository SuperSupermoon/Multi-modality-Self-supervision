AP chest compared to ___ at 9:43 a.m.: In the interim, previous moderate left pleural effusion has been nearly completely aspirated and in its place is a moderate left pneumothorax with basal, apical and medial components. Moderate right pleural effusion is somewhat different in distribution, but not appreciably in volume compared to the earlier study. Right subclavian infusion port ends in the low SVC. Heart size is normal. Transsubclavian right atrial and ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses from the left axillary power pack. Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 2 p.m.
