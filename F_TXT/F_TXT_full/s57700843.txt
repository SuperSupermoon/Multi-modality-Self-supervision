Comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of intestinal tube that extends to the body of the stomach and then coils with the tip pointing upward, but substantially below the esophagogastric junction. There is increased opacification in the retrocardiac region with blunting of the costophrenic angle, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe as well as pleural effusion. The pulmonary vascularity is now within normal limits or only mildly elevated.
