Comparison is made to previous study from ___. The tip of the endotracheal tube is 3.5 cm above the carina. This could be pulled back approximately 1 cm for more optimal placement. There is again seen a nasogastric tube whose tip and side port are below the GE junction. There is a right IJ central line with distal lead tip in the mid SVC. There is persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. There has been increase in opacity at the left base. There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. There are densities at the right base suggestive of consolidation versus atelectasis. This is stable.
