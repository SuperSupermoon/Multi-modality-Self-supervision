In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a right pigtail catheter in the upper right lung with essentially complete re-expansion. Opacification at the right base is consistent with volume loss and layering pleural effusion. On the left, there is increased opacification with a configuration suggesting elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and small pleural effusion. Left subclavian PICC line extends to the lower portion of the SVC. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged.
