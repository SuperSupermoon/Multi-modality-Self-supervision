Heart size is normal with unremarkable cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contour. A right subclavian infusion port is unchanged in position with the catheter tip projecting over the right atrium. Again appreciated are linear opacities in the right lower lung and left mid lung likely representative of atelectasis along with an elliptical consolidation in the left mid lung likely representing change in configuration of atelectasis otherwise without effusion or pneumothorax. Left humeral head fixation hardware is incompletely imaged.
