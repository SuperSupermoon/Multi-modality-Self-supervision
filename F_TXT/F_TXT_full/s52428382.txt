Endotracheal tube with tip 4.2 cm above the carina. A right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the mid SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There are moderate layering bilateral effusions with bibasilar airspace opacity likely reflecting partial lower lobe compressive atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. Low lung volumes with appearance of mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Incidental note is made of an azygos lobe. The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to patient rotation. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
