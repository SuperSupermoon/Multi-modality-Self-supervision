The endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carina. An NG tube ends below the gastroesophageal junction with the tip out of view. Compared with prior exam, the right lung shows diffuse, mostly basal alveolar opacities, hilar engorgement and upper vascular redistribution suggestive of cardiac decompensation. A small right sided effusion is worsened from prior. In the left, there is nearly total opacification of the lung base with obscuration of the heart border and hemidiaphragm. The degree of opacification of the left lung base is conspicuously worse compared to the right lung base, suggesting underlying severe atelectasis in combination with the pulmonary edema and worsened left sided effusions. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob are present. Cardiomegaly cannot be clearly assessed due to obscuration of the left heart border.
