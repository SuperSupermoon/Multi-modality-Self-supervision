The endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 4.5-5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The left subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position with its tip in the proximal SVC. There is persistent total opacification at the left lung base with an associated effusion most likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. In addition, there is interval appearance of mild to moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema. There has also been interval appearance of a right lateral chest wall and neck subcutaneous emphysema. Subcutaneous emphysema is also seen in the left neck soft tissues as well as a inferiorly in the left lateral abdominal wall. Clinical correlation is advised as the subcutaneous emphysema is a new finding. There is no obvious pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. A catheter is seen overlying the right upper quadrant. A portion of a biliary stent and aortic stent are again seen. The heart remains enlarged.
