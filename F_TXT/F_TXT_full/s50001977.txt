Tracheostomy tube is in satisfactory position with the tip 4.5 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular central line and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. The heart remains stably enlarged. Lung volumes are markedly reduced and there is a small layering left effusion with persistent retrocardiac consolidation likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. No obvious pneumothorax.
