In comparison with the study of ___, the chest tubes are again seen bilaterally. There is no change in the small apical pneumothorax on the left and may be Ace similar or slightly larger pneumothorax on the right. Continued extensive opacification in the retrocardiac region with blunting of the left costophrenic angle is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Much less prominent changes are seen at the right base. No definite vascular congestion.
