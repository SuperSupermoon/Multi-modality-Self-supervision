A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach, its distal course not otherwise imaged, however. A right internal jugular catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Streaky retrocardiac opacity suggests minor atelectasis. The lungs appear otherwise clear.
