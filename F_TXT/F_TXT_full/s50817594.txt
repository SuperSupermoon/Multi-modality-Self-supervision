Since the prior exam performed one day prior, the patient has been extubated. There has been interval development of mild pulmonary edema. Increased opacification in the left lower lung zone could be due to asymmetric edema, although early pneumonia is a consideration. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The left pigtail catheter is unchanged in position. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. A Dobbhoff tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the majority of the catheter out of the field of view.
