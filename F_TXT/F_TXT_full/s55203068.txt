Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier. ET tube is in standard position. There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Large right upper lobe consolidation is stable. The differential diagnosis still includes large area of aspiration, pneumonia or hemorrage. The lower lobe opacities are improving consistent with improving atelectasis. There are no new lung abnormalities. The balloon of the tracheal tube appears to be still overinflated.
