AP chest compared to 5:41 p.m.: Nasogastric tube has been withdrawn to the upper stomach. Asymmetric basal opacification, suggests right lower lobe pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage, accompanied by a small right effusion. On the left, there could be a new 16 mm wide left basal lung nodule or the left nipple projecting over the lung. Conventional radiographs may be able to clarify this, particularly if supplemented with shallow oblique views utilizing nipple markers. Dr. ___ was paged and we discussed the findings by telephone at 9:05AM.
