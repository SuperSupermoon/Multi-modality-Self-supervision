Since the recent study, interstitial edema has slightly improved, and right basilar atelectasis adjacent to the elevated hemidiaphragm is also slightly better. Patchy and linear left retrocardiac opacities have worsened, however, and probably represent atelectasis. Developing infection in this region is less likely, but followup films may be helpful in this regard. Small pleural effusions are noted, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
