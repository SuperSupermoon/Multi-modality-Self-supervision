AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. The right PICC line tip is at the level of superior SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. Interstitial prominence appears to be slightly progressed compared to the prior study, in particular in the perihilar and left upper lung that might be consistent with interval progression of pulmonary edema. The left PICC line seen on the prior examination is not appreciated on the current study.
