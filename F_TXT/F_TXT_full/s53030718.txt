1. Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified on the current study. Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip at the cavoatrial junction or possibly within the proximal right atrium. Lung volumes remain low and there are layering bilateral effusions with bibasilar airspace opacities which may represent compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There continues to be mild perihilar edema, although there has been interval improvement since the prior study. There has been prior median sternotomy. The heart is stably enlarged. No pneumothorax is seen.
