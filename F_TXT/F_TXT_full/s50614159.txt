Widespread alveolar opacities have improved with partial clearing at the apices and residual ground-glass and reticular opacities in the mid and lower lung zones as well as some dependent consolidation at the bases. Pleural effusions have also decreased in size with residual small effusions remaining. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable, and indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position.
