In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. There has been some decrease in the opacification in the lower half of the left hemithorax, consistent with re-expansion of some of the left lower lobe, presumably from expectoration of a mucous plug. Nevertheless, there is still asymmetric opacification at the left base, consistent with volume loss and possible pleural fluid. The pulmonary vascularity remains engorged and indistinct, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
