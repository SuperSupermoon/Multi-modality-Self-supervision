Again seen is background COPD and moderate cardiomegaly, with an unfolded aorta. There has been considerable clearing of opacity at the right base and at the left base, with renewed visualization of both diaphragms. There is upper zone redistribution which could reflect vascular congestion.There are mild diffuse increased interstitial markings. Thus, the differential for the interstitial markings includes interstitial edema, fibrosis, and inflammatory or infectious interstitial process. No new focal opacity to confirm the presence of an interval aspiration event is identified.
