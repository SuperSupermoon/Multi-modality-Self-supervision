In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Low lung volumes may account for some of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. The outermost portion of the left hemithorax has been excluded from the image. Opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. The degree of pleural effusion is difficult to assess. On the right, there are only minimal atelectatic changes at the base. No definite pulmonary vascular congestion.
