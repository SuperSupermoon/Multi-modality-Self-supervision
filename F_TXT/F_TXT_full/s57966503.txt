Lung volumes are low exaggerating prominence of the cardiac silhouette and vascular crowding, although compared to prior exam there is haziness of the pulmonary vasculature suggestive of a component of pulmonary edema. Low lung volumes are associated with bibasilar atelectasis. A tracheostomy tube is in proper positioning. A right PICC is again seen with the tip terminating in the right atrium. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
