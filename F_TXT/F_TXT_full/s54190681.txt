Single frontal view of the chest. Right PICC is in stable position, terminating in the mid SVC. Heart size and mediastinal contours, including tortuosity of the aorta, are stable. Lung hyperinflation and bilateral calcified granulomas are similar to prior. The lungs otherwise appear clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Mucous plugging and left upper lobe consolidation seen on ___ chest CT are not apparent on the current chest radiograph.
