The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including mild cardiomegaly. There is similar elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with persistent unchanged vague left mid to lower lung opacity which may indicate some degree of chronic atelectasis and, particularly given lack of change, isnot suspicious for an acute superimposed process. The lungs appear otherwise clear. Old left-sided rib fractures are also unchanged. There has been no significant change.
