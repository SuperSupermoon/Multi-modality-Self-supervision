Comparison is made to previous study from ___. The endotracheal tube, bilateral central venous catheters, and feeding tube are again seen. There is a single loop in the feeding tube distally; however, the tip and side port are still in the fundus of the stomach. There are low lung volumes. There is atelectasis at the lung bases, left side worse than right. There are no pneumothoraces. Overall, these findings appear stable.
