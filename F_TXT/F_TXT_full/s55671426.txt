Moderate volume of left pleural fluid has recurred. No pneumothorax. Large right fissure oral pleural fluid collection is long-standing. Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is more engorged, but I hesitate to say there is new edema. Greater opacification in the right lower lobe is new consolidation, raising concern for continued aspiration. Tip of the ET tube is in standard placement. Feeding tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
