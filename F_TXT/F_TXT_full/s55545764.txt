Right internal jugular venous catheter terminates in low SVC. ET tube terminates 39 mm above the carina. A pigtail catheter is in unchanged position projecting over the cardiac apex and left lower chest. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion and moderate left lower lobe atelectasis are similar as before. There is mild right lower lobe atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. No new consolidation is identified. Enlarged cardiac silhouette is stable and consistent with known pericardial effusion.There is no distention of mediastinal veins to suggest presence of hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion.
