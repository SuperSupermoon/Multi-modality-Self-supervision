A right large-bore internal jugular approach catheter tip remains in unchanged position within the upper SVC. A right basilar chest tube tip also remains in stable position. There are scattered areas of right greater than left basilar atelectasis. In addition there is apparent nodular opacification such as projecting over the left mid lung zone measuring up to 9 mm where previously smaller pulmonary nodules were noted on CT examination from ___. There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature without frank interstitial pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable demonstrating mild cardiomegaly. There are no large pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube has been removed in the interim. The epidural catheter is no longer apparent.
