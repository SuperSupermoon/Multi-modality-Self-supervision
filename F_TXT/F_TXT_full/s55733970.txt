Lung volumes are low. Heart size remains mildly enlarged, accentuated due to low lung volumes. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged and within normal limits. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures likely relates to low lung volumes without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in lung bases most likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Clips project over the left axilla.
