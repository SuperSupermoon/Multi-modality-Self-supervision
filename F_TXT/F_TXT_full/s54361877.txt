Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates hyperexpanded lungs and flattening of hemidiaphragms, compatible with underlying emphysema. There are prominent interstitial markings. Superimposed, there are airspace opacities in the right upper and bilateral lower lung zones, which appear new since prior exam. There is no pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Again noted are prominent pulmonary arteries, which may reflect underlying pulmonary hypertension. Heart size is top normal. Mild dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is noted.
