As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a massive progression. The patient has developed generalized consolidation of the lung parenchyma, with only a few strongly opacified areas showing air bronchograms. These are located in the left lung periphery, in the right upper lobe base and in the right lower lobe apex. The size of the cardiac silhouette cannot be determined with safety. Moreover, the costophrenic sinuses are blunted, suggesting the presence of pulmonary edema. The endotracheal tube tip now projects 7 cm above the carina. No evidence of pneumothorax.
