A portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest wall pacer device with the leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle, endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, and an enteric tube coursing below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image. Lung volumes are low. The cardiac silhouette is prominent, likely mildly enlarged. Diffuse bilateral opacities likely represents edema, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. No large consolidation is identified. Surgical clips in the right axilla are noted. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant are likely related to prior cholecystectomy. The visualized upper abdomen is otherwise unremarkable.
