Moderate severe pulmonary edema worsened on ___, improved later in the day, and subsequently recurred it has changed in distribution and morphology, but probably not in overall severity, now moderate again. More pronounced consolidation in the left lower lobe raises the possibility of concurrent pneumonia or atelectasis but has not changed appreciably over the past several days. Small pleural effusions are presumed. Mild cardiomegaly stable. Tip of the endotracheal tube more than 7 cm in the carina above the upper margin of the clavicles has been persistent, and I have discussed with house staff. Right PIC line ends centrally, and a transesophageal drainage tube passes into the nondistended stomach and out of view.
