There remains marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. New increased opacity in the left retrocardiac region adjacent to an increasingly elevated left hemidiaphragm could reflect atelectasis or aspiration given the clinical suspicion for the latter entity. A subcentimeter nodular opacity in the level of the right third anterior rib is again demonstrated and previously carried a recommendation for followup chest radiographs. Linear opacities at right lung base are consistent with atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
