Patient is slightly rotated. Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.1 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, possibly terminating at the GE junction. There is large opacity over the right hemi thorax with some aeration seen in the upper to mid lung. Findings are concerning for large pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. Underlying consolidation may be present. The left lung demonstrates increased interstitial markings which may be chronic or due to vascular congestion/mild interstitial edema. No pneumothorax is seen. The aorta is calcified. The cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the right sided opacity, but is likely mild to moderately enlarged. Bilateral shoulder degenerative changes are seen.
