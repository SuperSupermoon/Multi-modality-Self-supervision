A weighted feeding tube is again seen within the stomach, with interval removal of the previously placed guide wire. Surgical ___ are seen behind the stomach shadow. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits, aside from some mediastinal clips and sternotomy sutures suggesting prior CABG. There is no focal pulmonary opacity, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax. Minimal linear opacity seen in the left lung base probably represents linear atelectasis. Osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
