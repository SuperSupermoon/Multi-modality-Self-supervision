The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiovascular surgery. Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in place. Vascular sheath has been replaced by a right internal jugular central venous catheter which terminates in the lower superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Pulmonary vascular congestion and perihilar edema have improved, as well as a more focal opacity at the right lung base.
