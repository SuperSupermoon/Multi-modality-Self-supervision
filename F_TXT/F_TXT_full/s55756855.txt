Tracheostomy tube is again noted. Left-sided PICC line tip overlies the proximal SVC. Right-sided PICC line is no longer visualized and has presumably been removed. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Again seen are what appear to be bilateral right greater the left effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior study. Some platelike atelectasis at the left base is more pronounced on the current study. There is mild diffuse vascular plethora, not significantly changed.
