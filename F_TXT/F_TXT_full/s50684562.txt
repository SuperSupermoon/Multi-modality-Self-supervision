Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is slightly unfolded. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Calcification within the medial aspect of the right upper lung field likely reflects a calcified granuloma. There is minimal atelectasis at the lung bases. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Lungs are hyperinflated suggestive of underlying COPD. There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement. Remote right-sided rib fractures are present.
