Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. The area of opacification at the left base is stable as compared to the prior study. There is only minimal soft tissue air collection in the left chest wall. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The right lung is normal. There is no pneumothorax.
