AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Previous lateral right apical pleural tube removed. Slight interval increase in subcutaneous emphysema in the right neck could be coincidental, but there is very tiny right apical pneumothorax now evident. The medial apical and basal pleural tubes are unchanged in their respective positions. There is no substantial right pleural collection, only mild pleural thickening and basal atelectasis. Left lung clear. Heart size normal.
