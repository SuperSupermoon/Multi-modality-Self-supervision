However, the pattern has somewhat change, with the right heart border quite well seen. This suggests that the appearance reflect substantial volume loss in the right lower lobe with pleural effusion. There is some elevation of the right minor fissure with opacification above it. This suggests some volume loss with superimposed pneumonia in the right upper lobe. The left lung remains clear.
