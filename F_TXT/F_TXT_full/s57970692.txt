As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position. There is unchanged evidence of relatively massive bilateral interstitial prominence, likely caused by interstitial fluid overload. However, given the small lung volumes, a coexisting fibrotic process is another differential diagnosis. No larger pleural effusions. Moderate cardiomegaly.
