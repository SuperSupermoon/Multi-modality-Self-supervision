Endotracheal tube now terminates 6 cm from the carina. Swan-Ganz catheter demonstrates an abrupt angulation at the right ventricle and its tip terminates at the right ventricular outflow tract. The heart is enlarged. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. There is improving airspace opacity of the right lower lung, which likely represents improving asymmetric edema. However, there is worsening of the left retrocardiac opacity which may represent a combination of atelectasis and effusion. No new focal consolidations are identified. There is no pneumothorax.
