Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Single-lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with lead extending to the expected position of the right ventricle. There is left base opacity and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm which may be due to atelectasis and underlying consolidation, trace left pleural effusion may be present. The right lung is clear and relatively hyperinflated. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. Surgical clips are seen in the right upper quadrant.
