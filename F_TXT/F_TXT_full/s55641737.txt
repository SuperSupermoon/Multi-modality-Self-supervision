AP chest compared to ___: New endotracheal tube is in standard position. Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right atrial pacer lead is coiled in the atrium, left ventricular lead passes directly to the region of the right ventricular apex. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are presumed, but minimal. An improvement in the extent of opacification in the left lung, which is more severe than the right, is probably due to clearance of atelectasis in the left lower lobe, probably a function of bronchial obstruction. Widespread heterogeneous opacification is due mostly to multifocal pneumonia. Mild interstitial edema is also present. Mediastinal widening is due to a combination of adenopathy and dilated veins. No pneumothorax.
