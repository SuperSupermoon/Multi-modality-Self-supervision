Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates right PIC catheter tip coiled at the level of mid SVC. It maybe positioned within the azygos vein. Left pleural catheter has been removed. Trace left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion persists with adjacent areas of opacities, likely atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax.
