In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the stomach. The side hole is not well seen and could be above the esophagogastric junction. The left IJ catheter has been advanced so that the tip is in the mid portion of the SVC. Hazy opacification at the right base above an elevated hemidiaphragmatic contour most likely reflects pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Left lung is essentially clear.
