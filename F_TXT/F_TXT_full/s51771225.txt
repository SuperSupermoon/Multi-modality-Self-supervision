AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. There is a poorly defined opacity at the left lung base, which could reflect crowding of bronchovasculature and underpenetrated technique, though the possibility of an early pneumonia cannot be excluded. Consider dedicated PA and lateral view to better assess. No large effusions or pneumothorax is seen. The heart size appears grossly stable. No mediastinal contour abnormalities are seen. Bony structures are intact.
