ET tube is now in standard position. The Swan-Ganz catheter describes a smaller arc through the right heart but still ends in the right pulmonary artery. Right paramedian drainage catheter traverses the right chest, is unchanged in position but I cannot localize it anatomically on a single frontal view. Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are still present. Moderate to severe pulmonary edema, worse in the right lung, and enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette are unchanged.
