Interval intubation with endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The left internal jugular central line is unchanged in position with its tip in the proximal SVC. Status post median sternotomy with stably enlarged cardiac and mediastinal contours. Increased lucency overlying the right hemidiaphragm likely related to recent exploratory surgery in this patient with known free intraperitoneal air as documented on a lateral decubitus abdominal study dated ___ at 15:25. Increasing perihilar fullness which may reflect a fluid replete state, as there is no overt pulmonary edema. Increasing opacity in the retrocardiac region likely reflects increasing atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Possible layering left effusion.
