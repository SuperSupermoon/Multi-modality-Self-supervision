Endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. The pulmonary vasculature is now indistinct suggesting interval appearance of mild interstitial edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in technique. No large effusions. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect a small hiatal hernia or possibly atelectasis. This can be better assessed on followup imaging.
