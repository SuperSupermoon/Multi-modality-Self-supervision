Endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is within the stomach. A left carotid endarterectomy stent is noted. There is no pneumothorax or left pleural effusion. The right costophrenic angle is not imaged. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Left retrocardiac opacity is better seen on the subsequent CT likely due to aspiration.
