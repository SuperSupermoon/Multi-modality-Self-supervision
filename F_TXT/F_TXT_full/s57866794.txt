Interval removal of the nasogastric tube. Linear opacity at the left base is unchanged and may reflect subsegmental atelectasis or possibly scarring. Small left layering effusion with associated retrocardiac opacity which may reflect lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. There is now some mild perihilar vascular congestion suggesting a fluid replete state but no overt pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
