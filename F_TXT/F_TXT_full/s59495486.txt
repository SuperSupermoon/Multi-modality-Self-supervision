Left-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the proximal right atrium, unchanged. The right PICC has been removed. Mild cardiomegaly again is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal contours are stable. Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position. There has been interval improvement in the previous pattern of pulmonary edema. Additionally, bilateral pleural effusions have also decreased in size, with persistent small left and trace right pleural effusions noted. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
