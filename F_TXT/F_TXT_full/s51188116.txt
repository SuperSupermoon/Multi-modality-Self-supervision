Dense consolidation in the right mid lung has partially cleared, and likely represents resolving hemorrhage as reported following the patient's recent procedure. More diffuse opacities in the right lung have slightly worsened at the right lung base, and are consistent with the history of infection. Stable mediastinal and hilar widening consistent with lymphadenopathy, with adjacent post-radiation fibrosis. Subtle opacities at left lung base have increased from the recent radiograph and could potentially represent additional site of infection or secondary process such as localized aspiration.
