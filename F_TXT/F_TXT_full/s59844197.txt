A right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the level of the superior cavoatrial junction, and may just into the right atrium. The layering right pleural effusion with associated right basilar airspace opacity are not appreciably changed. There is new left lung base subsegmental atelectasis. The apparent change in the mediastinal contour is likely due to rotation. There are no new focal consolidations or pneumothorax.
