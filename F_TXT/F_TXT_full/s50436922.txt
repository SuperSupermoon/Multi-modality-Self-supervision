Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right atrium. Lung volumes remain low. Heart size is moderately enlarged, unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Crowding of bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes is present without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity in the right lung base is slightly worse compared to the previous chest radiograph. The left lung is clear. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is identified.
