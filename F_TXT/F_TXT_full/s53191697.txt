Absence of the right breast shadow and surgical clips in the right axilla indicate prior right mastectomy and lymph node dissection. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is no pneumothorax. A small right pleural effusion is decreased compared to the prior study. Bibasilar consolidations, likely atelectasis, are seen. Increase in diameter and indistinctness of pulmonary vessels with increase in pulmonary markings indicate volume overload.
