As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. The shape of the cardiac silhouette could suggest mild pericardial effusion, the finding should be excluded by echocardiography. The lungs are better ventilated than on the previous image. There is no overt pulmonary edema but the presence of a small left pleural effusion, combined to left lower lobe atelectasis, is likely. No pneumothorax.
