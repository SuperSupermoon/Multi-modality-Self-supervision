Single AP semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained. There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with overlying atelectasis. Bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, could relate to overlying atelectasis, although consolidation may also be present. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess due to the bibasilar opacities, although moderate-to-large pericardial effusion was seen on CT. Mediastinal contours are widened which may relate to underlying mediastinal lymphadenopathy as seen on CT from outside hospital. Additionally, projecting over the right upper lobe, there is an 8 mm rounded opacity which could represent underlying nodule; correlate with CT. Anchor screw is partially imaged projecting over the right humeral head.
