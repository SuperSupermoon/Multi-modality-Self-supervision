Surgical chain sutures are seen overlying the left mid lung. There is rightward rotation of the patient on the current examination. Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits. Central pulmonary vascular engorgement and left greater than right diffuse interstitial prominence likely reflects asymmetric mild pulmonary edema, left greater than right. More focal opacity within left lung apex may reflect superimposed infection. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
