As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Very extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms, additional consolidations in the retrocardiac lung zone. The changes are likely reflecting a combination of pulmonary edema and atelectasis, potentially combined to pneumonia. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette persists. No larger pleural effusions.
