An endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube tip terminates in the distal esophagus with side port in the upper/mid esophagus. There is persistent left hemithorax opacification with leftward shift of mediastinal structures indicative of left lung collapse. Probable small left pleural effusion is likely present. As noted previously there is a abrupt cut off of visualization of the distal left mainstem bronchus. Right PICC tip remains in unchanged position within the lower SVC. Remainder of the right lung is unchanged. Punctate radiopaque densities in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen likely reflect ingested material within the bowel.
