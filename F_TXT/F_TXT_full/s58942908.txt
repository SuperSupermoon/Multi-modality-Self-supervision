Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. There are stable bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis at the bases, as well as engorgement of pulmonary vasculature consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. A right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends in the right atrium. Tracheostomy tube is in appropriate position.
