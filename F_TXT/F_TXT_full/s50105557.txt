As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is noted. The lung volumes remain low. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position. The appearance of the aortic stent graft is constant. Constant size of the cardiac silhouette. The diffuse parenchymal opacities, peribronchial in distribution and most severe on the right than on the left are constant. Constant appearance of a thin-walled rounded right upper lobe lesion, partly projecting over the scapula, that could be further worked up by CT.
