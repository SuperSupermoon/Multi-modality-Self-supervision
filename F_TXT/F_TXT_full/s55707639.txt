Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There is persistent bilateral diffuse interstitial abnormality, which is not significantly changed from the prior study, and likely represents moderate pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view. A right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends in the mid SVC. Left-sided wide bore central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction.
