In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the mid body of the stomach. The side-port is not clearly seen, though it it appears to be distal to the esophagogastric junction. The tube could be pushed forward about 5-10 cm for more optimal position. Opacification persists in the retrocardiac region. Again this could represent atelectasis or, in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed aspiration.
