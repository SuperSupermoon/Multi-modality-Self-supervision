A portable view of the chest shows interval placement of a Dobhoff tube, which enters the stomach then loops superiorly ending in the distal esophagus. A right subclavian line is pulled back and sits within the subclavian vein. The cardiomediastinal contour is stable. Bibasilar opacities are unchanged as are small pleural effusions.
