As compared to the previous radiograph, the previous nasogastric tube was removed and tentatively replaced by a Dobbhoff catheter. This newly introduced catheter, however, is malpositioned in the right bronchial system without evidence of complications such as pneumothorax. According to a note on the referral, this malpositioned Dobbhoff catheter has been removed since discovered on the radiograph. The right internal jugular vein catheter is unchanged. Also unchanged are the left basal opacities and the size of the cardiac silhouette.
