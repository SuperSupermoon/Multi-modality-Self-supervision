Comparison is made with prior study performed 12 hours earlier. Mild increase in bilateral opacities is worrisome for increasing pleural effusions, more so on the left. This could be due to difference in positioning of the patient. Effusions are small to moderate on the right and moderate to large on the left. There is no pneumothorax. Mild vascular congestion has increased. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated. Widened mediastinum is grossly unchanged allowing for rotation of the patient. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Aorta stent is in unchanged position. Bilateral central catheters are in unchanged position.
