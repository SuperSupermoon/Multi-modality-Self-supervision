Portable AP chest radiograph. Diffuse interstitial and parenchymal opacities are decreased slightly compatible with minimal improvement in edema, particularly with reduction of the density of the right base. However upper to mid right lung more confluent opacity is decreased but still notable focally and may reflect asymmetric edema or masked infectious process. Cardiac enlargement is mild and stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
