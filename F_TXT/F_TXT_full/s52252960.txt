Single portable frontal view of the chest shows a newly placed tracheostomy tube in satisfactory position. There has been removal of a feeding tube. The right subclavian catheter tip terminates in the mid to low SVC. Although there has been improvement in the bilateral pleural effusions, there is still a moderate right and small left pleural effusion with resultant atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The mediastinum is widened but stable. There is no pneumothorax. Stable displaced rib fractures are noted.
