The lung volumes are low. There is relatively substantial cardiomegaly with enlargement of both the right and the left heart, but no pulmonary edema is present. Minimal peribronchial thickening at the right lung base, potentially consistent with chronic airways disease. No acute pneumonia, no pleural effusions.
