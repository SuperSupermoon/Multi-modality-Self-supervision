A right-sided chest tube is unchanged in position. Subcutaneous air tracking along the right chest wall persists. There is no definite right pneumothorax. Profound atelectasis on the left is worse from the preoperative chest radiograph of ___ and results in volume loss of the left hemithorax. This finding probably relates to a decrease in ventilation, which is most commonly from mucous plugging or an inability to clear secretions. Mild pulmonary edema is improved. A small left pleural effusion is presumed. Heart is mildly enlarged but stable. An epidural catheter is present.
