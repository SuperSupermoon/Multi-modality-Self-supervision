As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube and the left central venous access line are unchanged. There is a tendency to increase of the extensive right basal parenchymal opacity suggesting aspiration or pneumonia. The large left basal opacity is constant. Constant size of the cardiac silhouette. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities. No larger pleural effusions. Lung volumes are slightly decreased, which might be caused by decreased ventilatory pressure. Borderline diameter of the vascular structures, indicating mild fluid overload.
