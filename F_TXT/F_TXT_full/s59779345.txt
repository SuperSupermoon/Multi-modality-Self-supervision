There is a new moderate right pneumothorax as compared to prior examination. There is no significant shift of the mediastinal structures, although there is some mild splaying of the ipsilateral ribs, suggesting some degree of tension. The left lung is well expanded and clear. There is no vascular congestion, edema, or pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Surgical material is again visualized within the medial right lung apex.
