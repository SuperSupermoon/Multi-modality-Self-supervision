As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in diameter of the pulmonary vasculature, notably in the perihilar lung areas and at the lung bases. In addition, a small right pleural effusion has increased in extent. Overall, the findings are highly suggestive for increasing fluid overload. The retrocardiac lung areas are atelectatic. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No evidence of pneumonia.
