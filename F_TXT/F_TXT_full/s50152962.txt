In comparison to the radiograph from approximately 1 day prior, there has been no appreciable change in mild pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions have developed. The Swan-Ganz catheter remains at the level of the valve, and could be advanced by at least 4-5 cm to position its tip in the proximal right pulmonary artery. No other relevant change.
