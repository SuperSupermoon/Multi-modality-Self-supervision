AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Mild cardiac enlargement as before. No configurational interval change of the heart silhouette or the contours of the aorta. The pulmonary vasculature is still distended and has considerable perivascular haze on the bases. Beginning perivascular parenchymal densities most present in the right lower lobe but also seen on the left base were interpreted as beginning edema. These changes have regressed slightly. No new discrete parenchymal infiltrates have developed, and the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area. The findings indicate mild regression of mostly basal infiltrates interpreted as beginning edema. The radiographic observation of pulmonary edema was based on the clinical suspicion of fluid overload. The followup examination shows mild improvement, but further dehydration measures are needed to ensure normal pulmonary function.
