Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position with the tip at the cavoatrial junction. The endotracheal tube now has its tip 2.5 cm above the carina. There are scattered small calcified nodules within both lungs consistent with prior granulomatous disease. Retrocardiac consolidation persists likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
