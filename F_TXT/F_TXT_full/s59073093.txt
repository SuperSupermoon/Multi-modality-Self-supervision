Compared to the prior chest radiograph there has been slight improvement in the degree of aeration of the bilateral lungs, likely reflecting resolving pulmonary edema. There are reticular opacities with cystic change seen peripherally bilaterally consistent with the patient's known interstitial lung disease. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged compared to the prior study. No pneumothorax seen.
