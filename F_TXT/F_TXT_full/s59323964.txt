Interval placement of endotracheal tube with tip terminating 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach with tip directed cephalad in the fundus. Cardiac silhouette has slightly increased in size accompanied by widening of the vascular pedicle and development of a diffuse bilateral alveolar process with relative sparing of the lung periphery. Given the acute onset and distribution, this is most consistent with pulmonary edema, and less likely a massive aspiration event. There are likely layering pleural effusions bilaterally, moderate on the right and small on the left. No visible pneumothorax.
