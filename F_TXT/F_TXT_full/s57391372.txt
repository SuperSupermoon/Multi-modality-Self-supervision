Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for positional differences between the exams. Similarly, moderate right pleural effusion is likely unchanged when allowances are made for positional differences of the patient. Left pleural effusion and adjacent left retrocardiac opacity are apparently slightly improved. No new areas of consolidation are identified within the lungs to suggest a new source of infection.
