AP chest compared to ___, ___:08 p.m. Despite the new right pleural tube, although the pneumothorax is smaller, there is still a moderate residual. This raises the possibility that the new pleural tube, sharply angulated at the tip could be largely fissural. Careful followup advised to assure continued appropriate tube function. There is no left pneumothorax or appreciable left pleural effusion, with apical and basal pleural tubes still in place. Pulmonary vascular congestion continues, and mediastinal veins are also dilated. Widened mediastinum due to generally large and tortuous thoracic aorta is unchanged. Right jugular sheath is in standard position.
