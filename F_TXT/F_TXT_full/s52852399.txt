Portable semi-upright chest radiograph shows stable positioning of supporting lines and tubes. Note is again made that the left-sided central venous catheter tip is directed towards the right lateral wall of the SVC and could be advanced 2 cm or pulled back 1 cm. Diffuse haziness in the parenchyma, particularly in the perihilar regions where peribronchial cuffing is seen, suggests edema, though ARDS could give a similar picture. Marked cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic plaque in the thoracic aorta are unchanged.
