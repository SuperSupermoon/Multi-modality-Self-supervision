An NG tube is present. The tip extends beneath the diaphragm and overlies the upper mid abdomen, question in relation to the body of the stomach. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal. I suspect the presence of a hiatal hernia accounting for rounded density in the midline immediately above the diaphragm, with apparent fluid level. The aorta is calcified and slightly unfolded. There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. There is minimal patchy opacity at the left base medially, similar to the prior film, question atelectasis or scarring. A small focus of aspiration or early infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded. Minimal atelectasis at the right base medially. No gross effusion. Vertical curvilinear density at the left lung laterally most likely represents a skin fold. Assessment of the abdomen is limited, but shows what appears to be a mildly dilated loop of small bowel in left upper quadrant.
