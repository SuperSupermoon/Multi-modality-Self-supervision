Comparison is made to previous study from ___ at 7:47 a.m. There has been placement of an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 6.7 cm above the carina. The heart size is within normal limits. There is an enteric tube whose sideport is just below the GE junction. There is a right IJ central line with distal lead tip in the distal SVC. There is again seen severe emphysema and changes likely related to pulmonary fibrosis particularly within the right lung. Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely represents a small pleural effusion. There are no pneumothoraces. Overall, these findings appear stable.
