A right-sided central venous line is noted with the tip terminating in the lower right atrium/superior IVC. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is noted coursing along the right side of the body. Lung volumes are low. There are moderate -large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. The upper lungs are grossly clear. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate given the patient body habitus and pleural fluid, but there appears to be a least moderate cardiomegaly with central pulmonary vascular congestion.
