Single AP portable view of the chest demonstrates slightly increasing bibasilar interstitial opacities, suggestive of worsening atelectasis. No focal consolidations worrisome for pneumonia. Cardiac size is stable. The patient is status post thoracotomy. Chain sutures are noted in the left suprahilar area compatible with prior lingular resection. Known left perihilar mass is not well appreciated on the radiograph. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Hyperinflated lungs with emphysematous changes are re-demonstrated.
