The tip of the endotracheal tube is seen in the right mainstem bronchus and will need to be withdrawn. The tip of an NG tube is seen in the stomach. Other support devices including a Swan-Ganz catheter, right PICC line, mediastinal drain, and pleural drains are appropriately positioned. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, compatible with surgical history. Opacities in the bilateral lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, minimal on the right and moderate on the left, with a small to moderate left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
