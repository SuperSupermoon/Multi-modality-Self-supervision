1. Persistent retrocardiac consolidation which could represent partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered. There is residual streaky opacity in the right mid lung which could reflect atelectasis or possibly fluid loculated within the horizontal fissure. There has been some interval improvement in pulmonary edema where there is now pulmonary venous hypertension, but no overt failure. The heart remains mildly enlarged given portable technique. No pneumothorax is seen. No large effusions are appreciated. Prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissue most likely represents a distended azygos vein due to a fluid replete state.
