Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous study. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears mild to moderately enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities in lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
