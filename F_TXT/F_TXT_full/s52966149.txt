Low bilateral lung volumes. There are new patchy bilateral airspace opacities as well as vascular engorgement in keeping with new pulmonary edema. No discrete pneumothorax is identified. The size of the cardiac silhouette is still within normal limits however the vascular pedicle appears wider when compared to the prior radiograph. Contrast outlines the splenic flexure, likely related to the patient's recent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.
