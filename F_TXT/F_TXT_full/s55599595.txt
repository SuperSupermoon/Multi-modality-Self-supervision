Single supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates a malpositioned nasogastric tube, which is looped in the mid esophagus, with distal tip terminating in the pharynx, and directed inferiorly. An endotracheal tube terminates just above the level of the clavicular heads, approximately 7.2 cm above the level of the carina, and could be advanced approximately 2 cm for ideal positioning. The lung volumes are low. Retrocardiac opacity may be secondary to atelectasis, but lungs are otherwise clear of effusion, consolidation, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. The stomach is distended with air.
