In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. There is increasing elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour, which is now silhouetted laterally, with opacification above it. This suggests moderate atelectatic changes in the left lower lobe. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent an area of consolidation. Left perihilar opacity is slightly less prominent, though the disc could well still reflect a region of pneumonia. The right lung is essentially clear and there is no evidence vascular congestion.
