Lungs appear relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. Previously noted aneurysmal dilatation of the descending thoracic aorta is better assessed on CT.
