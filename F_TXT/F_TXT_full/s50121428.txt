Compared to prior chest radiographs ___ through ___, 05:14. Multifocal pulmonary consolidation has worsened in both lower lungs, probably progressive pneumonia. Pulmonary vasculature is more engorged suggesting a component of edema although moderate cardiomegaly has not worsened and mediastinal veins are not more dilated. There is the suggestion of a new to the 0.5 cm wide right upper lobe lung nodule at the level of the third rib anteriorly. If that is genuine, it is either a fluid-filled bulla or septic embolus. I would recommend repeat chest radiographs today to see if the finding is confirmed.
