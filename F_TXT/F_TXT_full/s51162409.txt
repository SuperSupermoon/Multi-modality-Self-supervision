Left lower lobe and lingula are collapsed. Both the severe atelectasis and moderate to large left pleural effusion have increased since earlier in the day. Right lung is grossly clear. Severe leftward mediastinal shift and adjacent pleural effusion obscures the left heart border and precludes evaluation of cardiomegaly. ET tube in standard placement. No pneumothorax.
