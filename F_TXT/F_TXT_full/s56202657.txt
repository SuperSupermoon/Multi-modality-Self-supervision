A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach, where it makes a single loop and proceeds distally, its inferior extent not imaged. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction or slightly into the atrium. There is again a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device in place. The patient is status post aortic valve replacement and probably coronary artery bypass surgery. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is persistent mild perihilar congestion, but pulmonary edema has improved. Pleural effusions are similar to improved bilaterally.
