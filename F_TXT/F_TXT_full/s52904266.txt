Pneumomediastinum persists, more apparent, but not necessarily worse. Extent of extrapleural emphysema in the right chest and minimal pneumothorax if any is unchanged. Increased opacification at the base of the left lung laterally is probably atelectasis. Atelectasis at both lung bases is also more pronounced. Heart is normal size, given low lung volumes. The extent of subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall and neck bilaterally has not appreciably changed. Right supraclavicular central venous infusion port ends the right atrium.
