RIght internal jugular line ends at mid SVC. Aortic stent is seen in the descending thoracic aorta. Since ___, left lower lung opacities and retrocardiac densities reflecting a combination of volume loss and pleural effusion have worsened. Right lung base atelectasis has also minimally increased. Due to the left lower lung opacities obscuring the cardiac margin, assessment for the heart size was limited. However, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged since the prior study. Upper lungs are clear.
