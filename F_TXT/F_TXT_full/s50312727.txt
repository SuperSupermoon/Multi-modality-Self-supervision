The ET tube terminates approximately 7 cm from the carina. There is an NG tube which extends below the diaphragm with the tip likely in the body of the stomach. There is a right-sided central line with the tip in the mid SVC. The heart is again severely enlarged, overall stable compared to exams dating back to ___. There appears to be interval increase in the opacification over the right lung suggestive of a slight increase in extent and severity of the right pleural effusion. There is worsening of a left lower lung atelectasis. The left pleural effusion is unchanged. The degree of pulmonary edema is constant. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. Massively enlarged triangular cardiac silhouette is again suggestive of a pericardial effusion.
