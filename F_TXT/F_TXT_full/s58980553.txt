AP chest compared to ___: Since ___, left pigtail pleural catheter has been replaced by three left thoracostomy tubes. The extent of loculated left pleural effusion has decreased substantially and the previous left basal pneumothorax is smaller. Atelectasis persists in the left lower lobe. On the right, a moderate-sized pleural effusion has changed in distribution but not in overall severity, including a substantial fissural component. The heart is moderately enlarged and unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged, but it is difficult to say if very mild interstitial edema is present. Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 6 cm from the carina and should be advanced 1 to 2 cm for more secured seating. Left internal jugular line ends in the low SVC. No right pneumothorax.
