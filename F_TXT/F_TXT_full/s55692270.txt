Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are similar to the prior study. Pulmonary vascular congestion is again demonstrated, with overall improvement in extent of perihilar edema, but a new peripheral focus of airspace opacity in the right upper lobe is demonstrated, and could reflect either shift of asymmetrical pulmonary edema, or a new process such as localized aspiration or developing infection or infarction. Moderate-to-large right and moderate left pleural effusion appear slightly larger than on the prior study, but positional differences could potentially contribute to this apparent change.
