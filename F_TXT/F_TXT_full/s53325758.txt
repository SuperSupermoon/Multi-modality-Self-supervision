Left-sided pacer device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the aortic knob. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacity in the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis with similar blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may be due to a small pleural effusion or pleural thickening. Left lung is clear. Scarring within the lung apices is re- demonstrated. An inferior vena cava filter is noted within the upper abdomen, just to the right of midline. No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
