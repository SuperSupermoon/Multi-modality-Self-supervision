Compared with the earlier film, an NG tube has been placed. The tip and side port overlie the proximal stomach. Additional tubing overlying the chest and abdomen is thought to lie outside the patient. The left-sided indwelling catheter is again noted, unchanged. On the current film, there is faint increased opacity at both lung bases, ? atelectasis. A small amount of pleural fluid would be difficult to exclude. Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
