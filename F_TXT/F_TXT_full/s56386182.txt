There are low lung volumes, which limits assessment of lung bases. The cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the low lung volumes, but is likely within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Streaky opacities in lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement. Clips are seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are noted. No free air is noted under the diaphragms.
