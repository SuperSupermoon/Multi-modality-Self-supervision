As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased. There is unchanged blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting a small left pleural effusion. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema. Unchanged minimal atelectasis at the left lung bases.
