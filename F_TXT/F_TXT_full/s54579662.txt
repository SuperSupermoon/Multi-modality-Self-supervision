Portable AP single chest view was obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Again there is mild degree of cardiac enlargement without typical configurational abnormality. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there is no evidence of pleural effusion as the lateral pleural sinuses are free on this portable examination. Observed, however, that a chest CT of ___ showed a small amount of right-sided pleural effusion as well as minimal amount of pericardial effusion. No new acute pulmonary infiltrates are seen and no pneumothorax exists in the apical area. In comparison with the next previous portable chest examination of ___, no significant interval change can be identified. Observed that there do not exist criteria for pulmonary vascular overload, but it can be stated that there is no evidence of significant increased pleural effusion, interstitial edema, or pulmonary alveolar edema.
