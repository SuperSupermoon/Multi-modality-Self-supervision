In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change and no definite pneumothorax. Continued hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. Basilar opacification on the left most likely represents volume loss in the lower lobe and possible small effusion. No vascular congestion. There is some prominence of ill defined interstitial markings on the left. This could represent some asymmetric pulmonary edema. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed in a pneumonia could be considered.
