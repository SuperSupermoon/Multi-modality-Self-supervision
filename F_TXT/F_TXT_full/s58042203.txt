Again seen is a severe convex right thoracic scoliosis and increased retrocardiac opacity due in part to the hiatal hernia. There is increased pulmonary vascular redistribution and a new infiltrate in the right lower lobe. It is unclear if this infiltrate is infectious or due to asymmetric pulmonary edema. The overall impression is that of CHF with or without associated infection in the right lower lobe.
