As compared to the previous radiograph, there is little overall change in appearance of the known right basilar opacity. In the interval, a pre-existing minimal left pleural effusion is slightly increased in extent and now causes mild left basal atelectasis. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant. No new parenchymal opacities. No pulmonary edema. Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires.
