Unfortunately a small right pneumothorax is difficult to distinguish from a skin fold parallel to the right upper chest wall, following removal of the right basal pigtail drainage catheter. However subsequent abdomen CT is showed no anterior pneumothorax in the right lower chest and therefore I doubt that any pneumothorax is present. Nevertheless it would be reasonable to repeat a chest radiograph in several hr, with special attention paid to avoiding skin folds. Dense consolidation left lower lobe, largely atelectasis, also could be pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion unchanged. Heart size normal. ET tube, esophageal drainage tube, right jugular catheter is unchanged in standard placements. No left pneumothorax.
