As compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff tube has been pulled back. The tip of the tube currently projects over the middle third of the esophagus. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other complications. A pre-existing left pleural effusion has substantially decreased in extent, but an area of retrocardiac opacities with air bronchograms persists, potentially reflecting reexpansion edema or pneumonia.
