Significant atelectasis persists in the left lower lobe, but probably improved, since leftward mediastinal shift is less pronounced. Atelectasis at the right base is mild. Upper lungs are clear. Small left pleural effusion is present. The small gas bubble projecting over the cardiac silhouette is presumably in the stomach beneath the elevated left hemidiaphragm, but it would be good to confirm that with conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs as soon as feasible.
