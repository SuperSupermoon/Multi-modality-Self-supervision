The lungs are clear aside for linear opacities in the lung bases which may represent atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An endotracheal tube ends approximately 3 cm above the carina. A new right IJ line ends at the lower SVC.
