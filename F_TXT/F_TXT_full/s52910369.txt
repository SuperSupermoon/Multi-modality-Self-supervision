In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. Continued mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta. There is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, unchanged from the previous study. Mild basilar atelectatic changes with possible small effusions. No definite acute focal pneumonia, though this would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
