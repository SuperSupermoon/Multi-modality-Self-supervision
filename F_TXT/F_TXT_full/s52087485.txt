Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates bilateral parenchymal opacities which have progressed over the interval from the prior study, and may represent ARDS or pneumonia. Allowing for patient positioning, the left-sided pleural effusion appears stable in size. The cardiac silhouette continues to be obscured. There is no pneumothorax. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view. A left-sided subclavian central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction.
