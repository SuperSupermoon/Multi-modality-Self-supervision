Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Extensive lung opacities on the left are unchanged. Known loculated left effusion has minimally increased. Left PICC tip is in the lower SVC. Pleural catheters in the left hemithorax are again noted. Increasing opacities in the right upper and right lower lobe are worrisome for pneumonia. There is a small right effusion. Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly unchanged.
