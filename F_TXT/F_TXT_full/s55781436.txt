An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position, 2.9 cm above the level of the carina. There are diffuse parenchymal opacities, with enlargement and indistinctness of the hila, findings suggestive of interval development of pulmonary edema. Opacities are asymmetric, right greater than left, which may be related to patient's positioning. An alternative explanation would be developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. There are also bibasilar opacities which likely reflect a combination of atelectasis and moderate bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is evident.
