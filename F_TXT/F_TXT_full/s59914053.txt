A single lead left-sided pacer remains in place. The heart remains enlarged with prominent mitral annular calcifications. Patchy opacity at the right base is not significantly changed favoring atelectasis in the setting of a chronically elevated right hemidiaphragm. However, there is increasing retrocardiac consolidation and likely an associated effusion, which although this could reflect atelectasis raises the possibility of pneumonia or aspiration. Clinical correlation is advised. In addition, the perihilar vasculature is more prominent suggesting a fluid replete state, no overt pulmonary edema is evident. Calcifications at the left apex are stable and may be pleural in etiology. No pneumothorax.
