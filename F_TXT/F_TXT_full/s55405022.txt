AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the frontal view of AP and lateral chest examination obtained two days earlier (___). Again, there is status post sternotomy and the presence of multiple surgical clips in the left-sided anterior mediastinal structures is indicative of bypass surgery. The heart size has not changed significantly. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. An apparently postoperatively developed thin plate atelectasis on the left base remains unchanged. The right hemithorax does not demonstrate any pulmonary abnormalities at all. Skeletal structures grossly unchanged and no evidence of pneumothorax.
