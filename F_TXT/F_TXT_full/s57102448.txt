There is slightly less opacity in the left mid and lower zones and, ? at the right lower zone. Some of this may be accounted for by technique. No definite pneumothorax is detected. Minimal curvilinear lucency at the left lung apex is equivocal for pneumothorax, but attention to this area on followup films is requested. A catheter overlies the left lung base, new compared with the most recent prior chest x-ray.
