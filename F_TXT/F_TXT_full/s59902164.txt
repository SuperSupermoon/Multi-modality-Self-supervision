Again seen is cardiomegaly, a large rounded opacity in the suprahilar portion of left lung and some patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is similar to prior. Some of the patchy opacity at the left base and left costophrenic region has improved. Vascular plethora and an increased interstitial markings are seen, consistent with CHF, but the CHF demonstrates interval improvement. Suspect background hyperinflation of the lungs, consistent with COPD.
