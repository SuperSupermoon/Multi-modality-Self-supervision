In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Again there are very low lung volumes that accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Little if any vascular congestion. Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm is again consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe, and there are probably small pleural effusions on both sides.
