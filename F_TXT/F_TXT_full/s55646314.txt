The lungs are well expanded and clear without lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. Mild linear opacity at the right lung base extending towards the hilum likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. Irregular calcification projecting over the left upper lung field may reflect calcified pleural plaques. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable in appearance. No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragm. No displaced rib fracture.
