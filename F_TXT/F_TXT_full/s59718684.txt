Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 1.3 cm above the level of the carina, low in position and should be withdrawn approximately 1.5 to 2 cm. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, coiling in the left upper quadrant in the expected position of the right ventricle. There is slight increased opacity in the right upper lobe, nonspecific, could be due to aspiration, or pneumonia. No pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
