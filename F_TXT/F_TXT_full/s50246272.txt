There has been interval placement of endotracheal tube, which has its tip 3.7 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is again seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Overall lung volumes remain stable, but there is indistinctness of the pulmonary vascularity suggestive of worsening interstitial pulmonary edema. More focal patchy opacities at both bases, left greater than right, may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax. Biapical pleural thickening is again seen. Possible small bilateral layering effusions. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning between studies.
