The left internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is identified. The remaining lines and tubes remain in standard positions. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are similar. There is continued diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities, perhaps minimally improved in the interval, compatible with mild pulmonary edema. More focal opacities within the right mid lung field and right lung base again could reflect areas of coexistent infection. Hazy opacity in the right lung base likely reflects the presence of a small layering pleural effusion, as seen previously.
