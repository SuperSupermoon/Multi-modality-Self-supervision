Following removal of right chest tube, a small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax has developed. This has subsequently been followed on separately dictated chest radiograph performed after this time. Endotracheal tube has been removed. Swan-Ganz catheter has been slightly withdrawn, now terminating in right ventricular outflow tract. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable except for resolution of pneumomediastinum. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has slightly worsened, and note is also made of increased right pleural effusion with adjacent worsening atelectasis in the right mid and lower lung regions. Left basilar atelectasis has also slightly worsened and is accompanied by a small left pleural effusion.
