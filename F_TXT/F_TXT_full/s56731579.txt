1. Right pigtail pleural catheter is again seen at the apex. A tiny right apical pneumothorax is stable. There is streaky patchy opacity in the right upper and lower lung as well as at the left lung base in the setting of low lung volumes. This most likely represents patchy atelectasis, although an evolving pneumonia should also be considered. No large effusions. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
