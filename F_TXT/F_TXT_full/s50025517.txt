Lung volumes are low. Left-sided chest tube is noted with tip projecting over the left upper lung field. Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema is demonstrated within the left lateral chest wall. No pneumothorax is clearly visible on this exam. Heart size is accentuated due to low lung volumes, but likely mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted. Small left pleural effusion is demonstrated. Bibasilar airspace opacities, more pronounced in the retrocardiac region, may reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded. There are no acute osseous abnormalities detected.
