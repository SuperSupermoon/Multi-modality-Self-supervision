ET tube terminates 46 mm above the carina. Transesophageal tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view. Right internal jugular venous catheter terminates in mid SVC. Increased attenuation of the right lung is likely due to layering large pleural effusion which is increased from before. Bilateral lower lobe collapse is unchanged. Left pleural effusion is small and unchanged. Opacity in the right lung apex appears slightly denser. Enlarged cardiac silhouette is stable.
