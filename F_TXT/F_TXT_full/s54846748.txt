Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of superior SVC. Heart size is enlarged. Mediastinum overall reveals no appreciable abnormality. There is left retrocardiac consolidation that in the absence of prior studies is concerning for pneumonia. Atelectasis would be another possibility. If clinically warranted, correlation with chest CT might be considered.
