Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is unchanged in position. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette enlarged and the aortic calcified and tortuous. There are bilateral perihilar airspace opacities, right greater than left, which may be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema and/or infection. Aspiration or pulmonary hemorrhage are felt less likely. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to atelectasis or trace pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The patient is status post median sternotomy.
