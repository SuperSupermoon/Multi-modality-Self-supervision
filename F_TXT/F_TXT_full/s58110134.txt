1. Tracheostomy tube unchanged in position with the tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Left internal jugular central line has been placed with its tip likely within the proximal right atrium near the cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes remain low. There is an airspace consolidation involving predominantly the right upper lobe, which would be worrisome for pneumonia. There is crowding of the vasculature. A more patchy opacity is also seen in both bases which could reflect areas of pneumonia or aspiration, less likely atelectasis. No large effusions. No pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-upright technique. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given patient rotation on the current study. There is possibly a portion of a PICC line visualized with the tip projecting over the mid portion of the right scapula.
