Large region of opacification at the base of the right lung could be pneumonia, particularly due to aspiration. There is a smaller region of consolidation on the left. Without a lateral view however it is impossible to know how much of the opacification in the right lower chest is due to pleural effusion which would obscure and could mimic pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is top-normal. Upper lungs are grossly clear.
