A tracheostomy tube is now in place and has its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. Right mid peripheral opacity is increasing and more likely reflects loculated fluid in the fissure, although parenchymal consolidation should also be considered. Increasing bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. In addition, there is prominence of the interstitium which could reflect a component of fluid overload, although no overt pulmonary edema is seen. Right paratracheal and hilar fullness is unchanged and likely reflects lymphadenopathy as evident on chest CT dated ___. Blunting of both costophrenic angles suggest the presence of small effusions.2
