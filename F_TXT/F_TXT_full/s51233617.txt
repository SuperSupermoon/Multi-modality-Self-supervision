Increased bibasilar airspace opacities, right greater than left, may represent atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes or potentially aspiration or early pneumonia. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. A right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the origin of the SVC. The endotracheal tube terminates 6.3 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view.
