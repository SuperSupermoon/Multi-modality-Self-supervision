Nodular opacities projecting over the bilateral lower chest bilaterally, symmetric, are most consistent with nipple shadows. Subtle medial right basilar patchy opacity likely relates to atelectasis, given that is more conspicuous than the prior exam earlier today, however, in the appropriate clinical setting, early consolidation is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
