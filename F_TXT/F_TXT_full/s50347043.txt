Dual lead left-sided AICD is stable in position. Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly stable to possibly minimally increased. Left base opacity and partial obscuration of left hemidiaphragm could be due to atelectasis and small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Pulmonary vascular congestion is again seen. There is persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
