An endotracheal tube is positioned 4.2 cm above the level of the carina. A nasoenteric catheter courses below the diaphragm with the tip in the stomach. A left PICC is in unchanged position terminating in the mid SVC. There is consolidation within the left lung base. which appears similar to prior examination and likely reflects atelectasis or resolving pneumonia. No new confluent opacity is identified. There is no pneumothorax. Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles is unchanged from prior and likely suggests possible small effusions. There is no overt interstitial edema. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
