Endotracheal tube terminates 4.3 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the level the diaphragm, out of the field of view. The aorta is tortuous and heavily calcified. There also appears to be calcification of the right innominate/subclavian artery. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Left base opacity most likely due to atelectasis, underlying aspiration not excluded. The right lung is grossly clear. No large pleural effusion is seen.
