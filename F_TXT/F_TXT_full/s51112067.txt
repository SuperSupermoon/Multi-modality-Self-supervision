When compared to radiograph dated ___, there appears to be improved aeration of bilateral lungs. Two pigtail catheters are seen in constant position within the left chest. Right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis appears decreased in volume, though small changes are difficult to detect allowing for changes in patient positioning. No pneumothorax is identified. An endotracheal tube is seen terminating 3.2 cm from the level of the carina. A right PICC is identified terminating in the mid SVC. Known soft tissue air collections appear mildly improved.
