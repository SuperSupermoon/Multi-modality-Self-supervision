Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC. The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette persists. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is persistent mild to moderate pulmonary edema, slightly improved compared to the prior study, superimposed on a background of chronic interstitial abnormality. There is a background of emphysema noted as well. Small right pleural effusion appears relatively unchanged with chain sutures in the right lung base compatible prior resection. Old fracture of the left posterior 7th rib and partial resection of the right 5th rib are again noted. Widening of the left acromioclavicular joint is chronic and may be postsurgical.
