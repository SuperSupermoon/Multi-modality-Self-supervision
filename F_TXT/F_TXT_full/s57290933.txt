Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. Multiple mediastinal clips are again noted along the left mediastinal border. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Known right pleural mediastinal metastases are better visualized on the recent CT. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Lung volumes are low with crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Linear opacity at the left costophrenic angle may reflect scarring. Mild degenerative changes are noted in the imaged thoracic spine.
