As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities with areas of atelectasis at both lung bases and bilateral moderate pleural effusions. The monitoring and support devices remain in constant position. New parenchymal opacity at the level of the left hilus, likely caused by a local atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
