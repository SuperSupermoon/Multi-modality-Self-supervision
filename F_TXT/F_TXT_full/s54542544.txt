Lung volumes are low, and there is slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. While there is no focal consolidation, there are diffusely increased coarse interstitial markings, with peribronchial cuffing. There is no effusion or pneumothorax. Heart is normal in size, and the hilar and mediastinal contours are normal. There is mild tortuosity of the aortic knob. A rounded 3.7-cm structure with a sharply-defined lateral margin projects over the heart at left lung base, which is unchanged from the prior radiographs and per previous reports, may represent a posterior mediastinal mass, presumably a neurogenic tumor.
