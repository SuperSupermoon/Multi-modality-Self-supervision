AP portable single view chest x-ray in upright position shows reduced lung volume with new bilateral widespread opacification and interval increase of the vascular pedicle, compatible with new moderate pulmonary edema. Heart size is still moderately enlarged in a patient who has had median sternotomy for cardiac surgery. Bibasilar opacities, denser in the left lung base are probably due to the bibasilar pleural effusion, larger to the left. There is no pneumothorax.
