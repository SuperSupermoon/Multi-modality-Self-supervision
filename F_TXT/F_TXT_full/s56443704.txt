Moderate cardiomegaly is larger, mild edema is seen in the left lower lung and moderate right and small left pleural effusions have increased, all consistent with cardiac decompensation. A large region of opacification in the right midlung could be superimposition of edema and pleural effusion, but could also be pneumonia. Followup advised. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. Left jugular line ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax.
