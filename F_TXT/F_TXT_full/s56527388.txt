1. Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. Right internal jugular central line remains in place. There continues to be bilateral predominantly basilar airspace disease associated with layering effusions and prominence of the vasculature. These findings may represent pulmonary edema in the setting of underlying emphysema or a bibasilar pneumonia with superimposed interstitial edema. Linear scarring with associated chain sutures in the right upper lobe as well as in the lateral right mid lung are again seen consistent with stable post-operative changes. There are multiple calcified mediastinal and hilar nodes consistent with prior granulomatous infection. Left apical pleural calcification is also again seen. No pneumothorax. Stable cardiac enlargement. Overall, there has been no significant interval change.
