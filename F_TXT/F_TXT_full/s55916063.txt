Compared to the prior study, there is now near complete opacification of the left chest, with multiple small lucent foci in the upper half of the lung which likely represent small areas of aerated long versus focal air within fluid. New compared to the prior study, sternotomy wires and midline mediastinal skin ___ are now visualized, compatible with interval surgery. There has been leftward shift of the mediastinum, likely contributing to the left chest opacity. The left chest tube, mediastinal drains, and 2 Swan-Ganz catheter have all shifted leftward. The plane of imaging of the prosthetic valve is also slightly different. The right chest tube remains in place, canal lying slightly lower over the lower right lung. The carina is not well delineated, but I suspect the ET tube tip lies approximately 3.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip and side-port overlying the upper stomach. Aside from mild plethora of upper zone vessels in the right lung, the right lung is grossly clear. Large rounded calcification, likely a large gallstone, again noted in the right upper abdomen
