Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position with the tip 3.6 cm above the carina. The lungs are hyperinflated with underlying parenchymal distortion suggestive of scarring related to emphysema. No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient rotation. Prominent calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. No pneumothorax.
