Low bilateral lung volumes. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax identified. The trace bilateral pleural effusions are better assessed on the earlier CT of the chest. Since the prior radiograph the tip of the left PICC line has been retracted, now projecting over the upper SVC with the tip folded back on itself and likely extending into the azygos vein. A feeding tube extends below the level of the diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph.
