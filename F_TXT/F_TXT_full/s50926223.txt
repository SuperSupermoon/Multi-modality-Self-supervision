Left chest wall AICD device is seen with leads in the right atrium ans right ventricle. A third lead likely coursing through the right ventricle but has an unusual wavy configuration. A lateral view would be helpful for better assessment of the position of the cardiac leads. A new small to moderate left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis are new. There is no pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with mild cardiomegaly. Multiple intact sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips relate to prior CABG.
