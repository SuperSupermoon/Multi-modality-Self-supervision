Combination of consolidation and moderate effusion at the base of the right lung has not improved since ___ 4:23 a.m. The elliptical lucency first noted on that examination persists. Given its rapid development, I doubt that it is in an abscess and suggest instead that it is either a pneumatocele, which may have developed during cardiac compressions or most likely due to fluid in the right major fissure surrounding and incomplete or adherent fissure. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and borderline interstitial edema seen most readily in the left lung have increased and there is more left pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. Azygos distention mild. Tip of endotracheal tube at the upper margin of the clavicles, 5 cm from the carina should not be withdrawn any further. No pneumothorax. Left infrahilar consolidation is most usually due to atelectasis, which worsened after the chest CT on ___, but may have improved slightly since ___.
