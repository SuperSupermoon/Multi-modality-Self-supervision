Frontal supine portable view of the chest provided. Examination limited due to underpenetrated technique and low lung volumes. Allowing for this, there is increased mid and lower lung opacities, left greater than right, which could represent pulmonary edema, asymmetric, though a superimposed left lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded. Effusions, probable bilateral and small likely present. No pneumothorax. Heart size cannot be assessed. Bony structures are intact. Clips in the left axilla again noted.
