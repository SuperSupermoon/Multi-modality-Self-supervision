Enteric tube tip is within the stomach. Lung volumes are lower compared to the prior study. Heart size is accentuated as result of low lung volumes, appearing mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is likely due to low lung volumes without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in lung bases most likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present.
