Widespread subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated, as well as pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, and small right apicolateral pneumothorax. Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Overall, little change in the appearance of the chest since the recent radiograph of a few hours earlier, with the exception of improved aeration at the lung bases.
