There has been interval removal of the left anterior chest tube. The left pleural effusion correlating to a hemothorax on recent CT and left lower lobe collapse are largely unchanged in the interval. Platelike atelectasis of the right lung base is stable. No new pleural effusions pneumothoraces. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Left chest tube terminates in left apex.
