Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are somewhat widened, but this is likely due to low lung volumes and the presence of mediastinal fat. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No overt pulmonary edema is noted. Minimal bibasilar streaky airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is demonstrated. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
