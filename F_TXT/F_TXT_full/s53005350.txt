Portable AP chest radiograph. Right-sided PICC tip is in the lower SVC. Blunting of the costophrenic sulci represents a combination of scarring and pleural thickening. The lungs are mildly hyperinflated and focality of interstitial edema in the left lower lung probably reflects severe emphysema elsewhere in the lungs. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Tracheostomy cuff appears hyperinflated and distends the tracheal wall.
