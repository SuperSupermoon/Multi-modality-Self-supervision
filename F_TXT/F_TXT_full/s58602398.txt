AP single view of the chest shows interval improvement of lung ventilation for reduced collapse of the left lung after extubation. Right hemidiaphragm is still significantly elevated compared to the contralateral with linear opacity at the right lung base likely due to atelectasis. Heart size is still mildly enlarged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
