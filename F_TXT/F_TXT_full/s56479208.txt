AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided. Evaluation is markedly limited due to low lung volumes. Subtle nodular opacity obscures the left mid to lower lung which could reflect aspiration in the correct clinical setting. Bronchovascular crowding likely accounts for subtle streaky opacity in the right lower lung. No pneumothorax or large effusion is seen. Heart size cannot be assessed. Mediastinal contour appears grossly stable allowing for technique. The bony structures are intact.
