AP chest compared to ___: Chin is probably in neutral position, which means the tip of the endotracheal tube 2.5 cm from the carina is probably ___-20 mm lower than optimal. Since tracheostomy is imminent, repositioning might not be indicated. Pulmonary edema continues to clear. Heart size is normal and mediastinal veins are not dilated. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. The texture of the lungs is heterogeneous and there may well be small lung nodules, because of overlying appliances, rib fractures, and asymmetric resolution of edema. When the patient's clinical situation permits, conventional chest radiograph should be performed. Dialysis catheter ends in the right atrium and a feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
