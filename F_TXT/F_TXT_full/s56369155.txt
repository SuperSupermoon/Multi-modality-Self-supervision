The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged probably due to a combination of cardiomegaly and known pericardial effusion. Catheter overlying the heart may reflect a pericardial drain and appears in unchanged position. Diffuse widespread ground-glass opacities and reticulations have improved, even allowing for increased lung volumes and may be related to improving pulmonary edema. However, there is a component of interstitial opacities which probably represent lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Acute lung findings partly obscure other findings related to known lung cancer. Underlying pulmonary neoplastic disease is better assessed on recent CT torso from ___. Confluent opacities at the left lung base and retrocardiac region appear increased but are difficult to compare due to technical differences in the exams.
