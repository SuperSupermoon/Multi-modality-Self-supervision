Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes, likely secondary to poor inspiration. Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved since previous imaging. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a patchy opacity in the left lung base, consistent with atelectasis. There has been interval intubation with the endotracheal tube now 2.7 cm above the carina with the tip pointing towards the right wall of the trachea. There is an NG tube visualized entering the stomach and passing out of view. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
