In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change in the appearance of the right IJ catheter, which still extends into the right atrium and could be pulled back approximately 4-5 cm. Opacification at the left base is again consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. The possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Pulmonary vessels are less well defined, suggesting some increasing pulmonary venous congestion. Continued apical pleural capping on the right, and to a lesser degree, on the left, with no evidence of pneumothorax.
