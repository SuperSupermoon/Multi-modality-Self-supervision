As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, potentially reflecting increased ventilatory pressures. An atelectasis is seen at the right lung bases, the pre-existing zone of increased opacity at the right apex has completely resolved. Retrocardiac atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion persist. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
