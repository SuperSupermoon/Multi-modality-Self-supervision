There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with opacity at the right lung base consistent with likely pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis. A left-sided chest tube is in-situ. No pneumothorax seen. Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. No definite consolidation seen. No frank pulmonary edema. The tip of the Doppler off tube is not visualized on this study.
