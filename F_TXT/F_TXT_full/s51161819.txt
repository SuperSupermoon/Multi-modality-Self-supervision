As compared to the recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, bilateral heterogeneous lung opacities are overall similar, except for possible slight worsening in the left mid lung region. Observed findings may be due to clinical diagnosis of ARDS, with or without superimposed infection. Small cystic lucency at right lung base may represent a pneumatocele from barotrauma. No definite pneumothorax.
