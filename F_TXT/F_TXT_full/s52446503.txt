Left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with no evidence of pneumothorax. Opacity involving the left mid and lower hemithorax is due to a combination of consolidation and pleural effusion. Small rounded lucency centrally in the left juxtahilar region could reflect an area of spared lung parenchyma or focal cavitation given the presence of necrotic pneumonia on earlier contrast-enhanced CT. Within the right lung, consolidation has progressed in the right lower lobe and is accompanied by an enlarging now moderate right pleural effusion.
