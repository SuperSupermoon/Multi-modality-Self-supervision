Given patient rotation, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There continue be some calcified right hilar lymph nodes suggestive of prior granulomatous infection. Lung volumes are slightly low with patchy opacities at both bases, left greater than right, which may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
