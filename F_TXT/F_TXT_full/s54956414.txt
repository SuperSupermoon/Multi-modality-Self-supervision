Lateral and apical component of the small left pneumothorax are no larger. The medial component has less fluid, following removal of the left pleural drain. Lung volumes are low and atelectasis probably counts for opacification at the base the right lung. Small right pleural effusion is stable. Heart size is normal. Moderate gaseous distention of the stomach is still present.
