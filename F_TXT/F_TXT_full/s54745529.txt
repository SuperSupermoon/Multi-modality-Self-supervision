As compared to ___ chest radiograph, pulmonary edema has decreased in severity with residual asymmetrical edema worse on the right than the left. Moderate right pleural effusion has apparently increased in size, although positional differences limit comparison. Worsening bibasilar opacities are likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion although other secondary process such as infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
