Sternum is still open. Nasogastric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. ET tube in standard placement. Pigtail pleural drainage catheter still present at the base of the left lung. No appreciable left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Small to moderate right pleural effusion probably explains greater opacification in the right lower chest, but it secures the lower lobe. Upper lungs are clear.
