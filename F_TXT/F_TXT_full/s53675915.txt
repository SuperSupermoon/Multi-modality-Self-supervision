In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the Dobhoff tube lies in the antrum of the stomach. The cardiac silhouette appears at the upper limits of normal in size. Engorgement of poorly defined pulmonary vessels is consistent with substantial elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. Bibasilar opacifications are consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the lower lobes, especially on the left. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
