Compared with prior exam, there has been mild interval improvement of aeration of both lungs, but there are still bilateral diffuse alveolar opacities compatible with pulmonary edema. The left apical opacity is also stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. An esophageal tube has been placed, with the side port seen below the gastroesophageal junction and the tip out of view. An endotracheal tube is present, ending approximately 7 cm above the carina.
