In comparison with the study of ___, there is a mild increase in aeration in the left hemithorax. Monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Widened mediastinum is consistent with postoperative changes related to surgery for ruptured aorta without dissection. The right hemidiaphragm is not well seen, consistent with some pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis on the side. Subcutaneous gas along the left lateral chest wall is decreasing.
