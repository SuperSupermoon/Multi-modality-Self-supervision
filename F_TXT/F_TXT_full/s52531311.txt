CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. Compared with ___ at 23:29 p.m. and allowing for technical differences, the degree of nodularity at the left base may be slightly improved. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen are patchy opacities, most pronounced in the right upper and left lower zone. There is relative paucity of lung markings along the mid zones of both lungs. However, no line of demarcation to suggest a pneumothorax is detected. Moreover, this appearance is similar to the appearance on the radiograph from ___.
