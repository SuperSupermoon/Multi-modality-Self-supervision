Tip of the tracheostomy tube has a lateral orientation directed to the left of midline. However, this is difficult to assess in the setting of rightward patient rotation. Diffuse mediastinal widening consistent with known thyroid mass appears unchanged, and cardiac silhouette is stable as well. Within the lungs, widespread pulmonary metastases are again demonstrated as well as persistent right lower lobe atelectasis and/or consolidation. Improved aeration at left lung base. No change in small right pleural effusion. Feeding tube has been advanced in the interval, now terminating in the body of the stomach.
