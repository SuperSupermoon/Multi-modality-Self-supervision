Following insertion of left apical and basal pleural drains, there has been a substantial decrease in the volume of left pleural effusion, small to moderate, and largely basal. Left lower lobe is poorly aerated, so I cannot exclude pneumonia there. The upper lung is clear. There is mild re-expansion edema in the left midlung. Right lung is clear. CT scanning would be helpful in assessing both the left pleural space an the lower lung, depending course upon the profile of the thoracentesis aspirate. No pneumothorax.
