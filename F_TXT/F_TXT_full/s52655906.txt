1. Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip at the thoracic inlet. Lung volumes are somewhat lower, and there is crowding of the vasculature. There are patchy bibasilar opacities which may reflect patchy atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. No overt pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
