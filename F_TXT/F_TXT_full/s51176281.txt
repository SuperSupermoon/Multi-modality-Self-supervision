In comparison with the earlier study of this day, following bronchoscopy there has been substantial re-expansion of the left hemithorax with return of the mediastinal contents to a more normal appearance. Patchy areas of opacification are seen in the left hemithorax. Some of this may reflect re-expansion edema and some pleural fluid. In the appropriate clinical setting, aspiration or infectious pneumonia would have to be considered.
