AP chest compared to ___: Although right lung apex is hyperlucent, I cannot see the pleural edge of the lung. Pneumothorax, therefore, is minimal, if any, at the base of the right lung, adjacent to atelectasis. There is no appreciable right pleural effusion, pigtail pleural drain in place has been withdrawn minimally from the level of the third to fourth anterior interspace. Heart size is normal. Moderate atelectasis at the base of the left lung, unchanged.
