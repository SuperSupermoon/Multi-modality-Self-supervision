Single portable semi-erect chest radiograph is provided. Patient is rotated to her left. Lung volumes are low. The heart is upper limits of normal in size, exaggerated by the low lung volumes. Opacification projecting over the right middle lung zone may reflect sequela of atelectasis or aspiration though infectious etiology is difficult to exclude. Obscuration of the left costophrenic angle may reflect a small pleural effusion. Biapical pleural thickening may reflect layering pleural effusion. There is no large pneumothorax. No overt pulmonary edema. Prominence of the vascular pedicle is likely secondary to patient positioning and low lung volumes. No acute osseous abnormality is identified. Imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
