Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The NG tube tip projects over the stomach. The Swan-Ganz catheter tip projects over the right ventricule outflow tract. The ET tube tip is at the level of the clavicular heads approximately 6 cm above the carina. The left internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged since the prior study as well as there is no change in bilateral large pleural effusions and most likely present pulmonary edema. Aortic stent is redemonstrated. Current study does not show gastrojejunostomy (most likely not included in the field of view).
