There is significant elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with multiple surgical clips projecting over the right upper quadrant. A streaky opacity seen across the right lower lung is compatible with scarring. No other focal opacities are noted bilaterally with the exception of biapical pleuroparenchymal scarring. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Multiple surgical clips are noted throughout the neck and left supraclavicular region. Deformity of left clavicle appears chronic and post-traumatic. Cervical spine fixation devices are also identified.
