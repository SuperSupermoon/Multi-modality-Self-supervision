Left chest wall mass with associated rib destruction, adjacent pleural and parenchymal opacification in the left mid and lower hemithorax is unchanged since recent CT. Small lung nodules are seen to better detail on that study including a dominant right middle lobe nodule measuring about 8 mm. No new areas of consolidation are present to suggest the presence of a pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged allowing for marked patient rotation and apicolordotic projection.
