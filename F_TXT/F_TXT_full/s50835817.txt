Since the most recent prior radiograph, there has been no significant change. Again seen is a large left-sided pleural effusion, unchanged from prior exam. There is stable atelectasis of the right lower lobe as is evidenced by the minor fissure being pulled down. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is a right internal jugular central line terminating in the lower SVC.
