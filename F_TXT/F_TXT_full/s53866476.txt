In comparison with the study of ___, the previous PICC line has been removed. The tip of the current line is very difficult to see, though it appears to be in the upper to mid portion of the SVC. Oblique view could be considered if the precise position of the tip is of clinical significance. Otherwise, little changed, though there may be some slight increase in pulmonary vascular pressure.
