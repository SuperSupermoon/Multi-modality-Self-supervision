Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval removal of a left-sided PICC. Widespread parenchymal opacities bilaterally are again seen, increased at the left lung base, stable to possibly minimally decreased on the right. The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. Additionally, there is a concern for a pleural line on the right while some pulmonary markings are seen beyond, the contour and shape is concerning for a pneumothorax. Suggest repeat with better patient positioning and removal of external artifact. Difficult to exclude small pleural effusions. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. The above findings, including question of pneumothorax and recommendation for repeat with better positioning were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ via telephone on ___ at 7:38 p.m.
