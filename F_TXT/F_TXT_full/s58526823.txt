A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest pacemaker with the leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle, a right jugular central catheter with the tip in the mid SVC, and a nasogastric tube which extends at least into the stomach. The endotracheal tube tip is 2.8 cm above the carina. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is a moderate right pleural effusion. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax.
