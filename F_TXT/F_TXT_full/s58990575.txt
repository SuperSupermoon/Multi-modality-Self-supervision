Opacification at both bases is a combination of small pleural effusion and basal consolidation, either pneumonia or atelectasis. Lateral view would be helpful in distinguishing between these possibilities. Upper lungs are clear. Heart size is normal. A thin wire leads from the left axillary generator are traceable to a stimulator in the paraspinal region at the thoracic outlet, but I cannot document continuity.
