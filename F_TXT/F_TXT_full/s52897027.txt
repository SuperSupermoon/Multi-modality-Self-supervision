Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiac size is top normal. Large bilateral pleural effusions associated with adjacent atelectasis are unchanged, allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. ET tube tip is in a standard position 5.1 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
