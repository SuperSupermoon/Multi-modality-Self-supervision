Compared to the prior study from ___, there are no significant changes. Multiloculated right lung collection extending up to the right apex is similar. Right lung base opacity with likely consolidation and/or atelectasis or aspiration is new. Left upper lung is clear. Minimal left lung base atelectasis and presumed small pleural effusions is similar. A previously described small loculated air at the right lung base is less conspicuous because of more opacity, which is likely from a combination of atelectasis and/or consolidation. A single chest tube is present at right lung base, unchanged in position.
