AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Both apical pleural margins are severely thickened, right greater than left. Hila are elevated and therefore the likely explanation is scarring, perhaps due to prior radiation. Lower lungs are grossly clear. Heart size top normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
