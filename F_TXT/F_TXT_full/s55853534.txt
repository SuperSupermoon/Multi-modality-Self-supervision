Interval placement of left and right chest tubes with subsequent decrease in size of the pleural effusions bilaterally. The tip of the right PICC line projects over the cavoatrial junction. Diffuse patchy and confluent airspace opacities bilaterally likely reflect underlying pulmonary edema and atelectasis. A trace left apical pneumothorax is visualized. The size the cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
