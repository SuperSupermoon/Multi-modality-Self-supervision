As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an overall decrease in lung volumes, with a subsequent increase in radiodensity of the pre-existing and known bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely of infectious origin. Unchanged extent of a pre-existing minimal right pleural effusion. No new parenchymal opacities. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged, unchanged course of the right PICC line.
