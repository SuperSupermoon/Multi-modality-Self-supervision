There is a right IJ Port-A-Cath with tip in the mid SVC. The heart is upper limits normal in size. There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. There is pulmonary vascular congestion. There are patchy areas of alveolar infiltrate, most marked in the right lower lung. It is unclear how much of this is from fluid overload or if a superimposed infectious infiltrate is present.
