As compared to the previous radiograph, the central subclavian line on the left has been removed. The left PICC line remains in situ. The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the mid SVC. There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. Extensive soft tissue air collections bilaterally in the chest wall and in the cervical region remains unchanged. Moderate atelectasis at both lung bases. The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
