Endotracheal tube is in standard position, terminating approximately 3.2 cm above the carina, and a nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates deep within the right atrium, with tip directed in the expected location of the tricuspid valve plane overlying the lower thoracic spine. Cardiomediastinal contours are remarkable for interval widening of the vascular pedicle, accompanied by new pulmonary vascular congestion and a bilateral asymmetrical distribution of perihilar ground-glass and reticular opacities, worse on the left than right. This may reflect asymmetrical edema and less likely aspiration. Focal atelectasis in the right lower lobe is also noted with increased opacity in the right retrocardiac region and mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The position of the right internal jugular catheter has been communicated by telephone with Dr. ___ on ___ at 8:30 a.m. at the time of discovery.
