Moderate-to-right pleural effusion has apparently increased in size since the prior radiograph and is associated with adjacent atelectasis and/or consolidation involving right middle and right lower lobes. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion also appears slightly larger with adjacent worsening basilar atelectasis. postoperative alterations of the mediastinum consistent with known esophagectomy and pull-up procedure appear similar to the prior examination.
