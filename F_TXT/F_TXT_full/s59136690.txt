In comparison with study of ___, the area of loculated pneumothorax at the right base has substantially filled with pleural fluid, which extends along the lateral chest wall. There appears to be some re-aeration of the right base with opacification that is consistent with some combination of atelectasis, fluid, and re-expansion edema. The left lung is clear except for blunting of the costophrenic angle and streaks of atelectasis at the base.
