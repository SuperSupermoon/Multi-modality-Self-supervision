Compare with the prior radiograph, the right IJ central line and nasogastric tubes have been removed, and the patient is now extubated. Left-sided chest tube is unchanged in position,, but there is evidence of a tiny left apical pneumothorax, with a pleural line projecting in the left third interspace. There is no associated mediastinal shift. Mediastinal drain again noted. No new focal consolidation. A left pleural effusion is small. Median sternotomy wires are intact. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unchanged.
