There are no old chest x-rays available for comparison. The ET tube is 6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach. The right hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated. There is volume loss in the right lower lobe and a probable small right effusion. A small right infiltrate in the right lower lobe cannot be excluded. There is a small amount of retrocardiac volume loss. Otherwise, the left lung is clear.
