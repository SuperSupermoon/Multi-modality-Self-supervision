Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. There is mild cardiomegaly. Bibasilar consolidations larger on the right side. Consolidation in the right middle lobe and ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe are better seen in prior CT, likely due to multifocal pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
