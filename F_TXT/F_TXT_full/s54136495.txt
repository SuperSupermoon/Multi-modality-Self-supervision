Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous study. This accounts for the increased size of the cardiac silhouette which appears moderately enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present, without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected, however the extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. Multiple clips are seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
