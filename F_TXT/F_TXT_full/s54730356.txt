Hazy opacity in the right mid-lung is likely due to overlying breast implant. Left lower lobe opacities are concerning for pneumonia. Furthermore, given leftward cardiac shift, an obstructive process in the left lower lobe cannot be ruled out. A left PICC line is not well seen with the tip possibly in the lower SVC. The heart size is stable. No pneumothorax.
