Tracheostomy tube in-situ. Low lung volumes. New linear opacity present in the left lung base which may represent atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Right-sided PICC line in situ with the tip in the proximal right atrium. The increase in vascular markings are thought to be secondary to the low lung volumes. Presumed small effusions.
