Portable AP upright chest radiograph shows improved aeration at the right lung base, presumably status post right-sided thoracentesis. No pneumothorax is visible. The left hemidiaphragm remains obscured and there appears to be increased haziness of the mid and upper lung zone compared to the study from eight hours earlier. Some of this may be exaggerated because of increased rotation. Left-sided PICC line tubing may be slightly pulled back and now is at the level of the mid superior vena cava.
