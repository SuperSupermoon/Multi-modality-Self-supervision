AP chest compared to ___: The previous severe consolidation in the right lung has not recurred and the lower lobe component continues to clear. Left lower lobe is clearing as well. If this was initially pulmonary edema, it has not recurred; however, I would reconsider the possibility of chronic severe and recurrent aspiration. Emphysema is reflected in large lung volumes. Heart is top normal size.
