1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 2. Slight interval improvement in aeration with residual perihilar fullness suggestive of mild perihilar edema. There are streaky patchy opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis in the setting of low volumes. There is likely a small layering left effusion. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
