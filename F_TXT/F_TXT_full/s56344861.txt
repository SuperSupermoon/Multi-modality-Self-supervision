There is some increasing linear opacity at the right lung base suggestive of increasing atelectasis. In addition, there is likely some reaccumulation of the right pleural effusion and there is a stable layering left effusion. The retrocardiac consolidation is stable, also most likely representing compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Lung volumes remain somewhat diminished. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.
