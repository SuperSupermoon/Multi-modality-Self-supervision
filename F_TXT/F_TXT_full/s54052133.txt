Since a recent study of less than 1 hr earlier, the patient has been intubated, with tip of tube terminating 2 cm above the carina. The cuff may be slightly over distended. Interval improved aeration at both lung bases with residual partial lower lobe atelectasis and moderate pleural effusions. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by asymmetrical bilateral airspace opacities, which could reflect asymmetrical edema with or without a superimposed infectious pneumonia in the right upper lobe.
