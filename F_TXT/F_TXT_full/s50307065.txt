AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. During the latest examination interval, the patient has been extubated and the previously present Swan-Ganz catheter including introduction sheath have been removed. Right and left-sided chest tubes advanced from below remain in position. No pneumothorax has developed. Specifically observed is the position of a left-sided PICC line which allegedly has been pulled back, but it still projects with its tip in an area clearly overlying the upper half of the right atrium. It was noted in the patient's chart that the PICC line was found to be occluded with no blood return and treated with TPA. If this line is not functioning, it may as well be removed completely so not to remain the potential cause of line-induced cardiac arrhythmia. No pneumothorax is seen. Telephone call was placed to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit and the responsible nurse was informed about the findings.
