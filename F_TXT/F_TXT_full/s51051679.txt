Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated to the left. Opacity projecting over the right medial base is felt to likely be due to overlapping vascular structures. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
