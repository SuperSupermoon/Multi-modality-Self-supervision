Again seen is an ET tube, tip at the level of the mid clavicular heads, 4.8 cm from the carina. The NG tube tip extends beneath the diaphragm off the film. Also again seen is a right IJ line, tip overlying the mid SVC. Clips are again noted over the upper mediastinum. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is vascular plethora, diffuse vascular blurring, and minimal fluid in the minor fissure, consistent with CHF. Hazy opacity over both lung bases likely represents layering bilateral layering pleural effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Compared with 1 day earlier, the right hemidiaphragm is obscured, likely reflecting an increase in the right pleural effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.
