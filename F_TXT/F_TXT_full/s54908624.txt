1. Lung volumes remain diminished with the right lung being grossly clear. There is opacity at the left base in the region of known wound where there is now a presence of a surgical drain. There is likely a left effusion, and the adjacent lung at the left base is likely atelectatic. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. The left heart border is obscured, limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours, but they are likely unchanged.
