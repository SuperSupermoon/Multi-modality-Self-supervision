As compared to the prior examination, decreased lung volumes are noted bilaterally. The focal consolidations seen in the right middle and right lower lobes are grossly stable. There has been interval progression of the left upper lobe opacity, which may represent interval progression of a left-sided infectious process. There are small bilateral pleural effusions identified. No overt pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is seen. Stable cardiomegaly and a widened mediastinum is again noted.
