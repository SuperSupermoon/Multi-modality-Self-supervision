As compared to the previous examination, the nasogastric tube has been advanced. The tip of the tube now projects over the distal part of the neoesophagus. The other monitoring and support devices are constant. The pre-existing minimal right pleural effusion has decreased in extent. The right lung is better ventilated than on the previous image. However, signs of mild fluid overload are still present but improved as compared to the prior radiograph. Disease particularly obvious in the left lung. Mild cardiomegaly and retrocardiac atelectasis persists.
