AP chest compared to ___: Mild pulmonary edema and severe left lower lobe atelectasis are unchanged. The heart is enlarged and mediastinal veins dilated, probably indicating a volume overload. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. Right pleural drain unchanged in the apex. No appreciable pneumothorax. The position of the tracheostomy tube with regard to the trachea is indeterminate because the airway is not clearly identified.
