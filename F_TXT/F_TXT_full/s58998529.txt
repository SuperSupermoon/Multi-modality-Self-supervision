Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There is new mild pulmonary edema. Increasing opacities in the right lower lobe are consistent with increasing small right effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Left lower lobe atelectasis is new or newly apparent. There is no pneumothorax. If any, there is a small left effusion. Left pacer lead tip is in the right ventricle. Severe cardiomegaly is stable. Large coarse calcification in the mitral annulus is again noted.
