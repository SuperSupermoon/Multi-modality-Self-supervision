There is abnormal soft tissue in the upper mediastinum, left greater than right, which may be due to underlying mass or aortic abnormality. Right basilar and right upper lung consolidations are also noted. The endotracheal tube terminates 7.9 cm above the carina and should be advanced approximately 4-5 cm for optimal placement. An enteric tube projects over the upper thorax, with its side hole at the level of the posterior third rib. The heart size is normal. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
