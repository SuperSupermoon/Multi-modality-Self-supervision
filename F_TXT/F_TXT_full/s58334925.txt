AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Between ___ severe pulmonary edema developed accompanied by increasing moderate cardiomegaly. Distribution of edema has changed since ___ but not the severity, and the heart is still moderately enlarged, accompanied by mediastinal vascular engorgement suggesting biventricular decompensation. If the patient received blood product transfusion, TRALI may be responsible for a component of the edema present which is otherwise probably cardiogenic. There is at least a small volume of pleural effusion bilaterally. ET tube is in standard placement, but the diameter of the tube is less than half of the trachea which may be smaller than desired. Clinical correlation advised. Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium at a level 5 cm below the carina. An upper enteric drainage tube ends at the gastroesophageal junction and would need to be advanced 15 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. No pneumothorax.
