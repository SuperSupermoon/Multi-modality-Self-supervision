Right internal jugular central line unchanged in position. Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. Interval removal of the left basilar chest tube with possible tiny left apical pneumothorax. This can be better assessed on followup imaging. Persistent bilateral small layering effusions with bibasilar patchy opacities suggestive of partial lower lobe atelectasis, left greater than right. Status post median sternotomy for CABG. Overall cardiac contour is difficult to assess due to the low lung volumes. Mediastinal contours are stable. No pulmonary edema.
