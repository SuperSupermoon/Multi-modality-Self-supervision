Marked enlargement of cardiac silhouette is due to a combination of severe cardiomegaly and small pericardial effusion as demonstrated on CT abdomen of one day earlier. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are new compared to the prior chest radiograph and are accompanied by adjacent bibasilar atelectasis. Nasogastric tube is present, terminating in the region of the gastroduodenal junction.
