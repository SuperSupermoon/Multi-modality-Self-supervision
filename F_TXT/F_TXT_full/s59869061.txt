As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared atelectasis at the right lung base, likely exaggerated by a leftward rotation of the patient. Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and a potential small left pleural effusion persists. No other changes. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
