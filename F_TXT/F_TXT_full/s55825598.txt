An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating at the thoracic inlet. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip terminating to the right of the spine at the expected position of the pylorus. The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased from the most recent prior study. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases on the left greater than the right are compatible with minimal atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
