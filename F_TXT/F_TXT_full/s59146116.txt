The radiograph was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The right chest tube is in unchanged position. The side hole is barely at the rib cage and potentially may be advanced. There is additional right chest tube placed. There is evidence of substantial subcutaneous air but no definitive evidence of pneumothorax seen on none of the radiographs. Subcutaneous air assessment demonstrates minimal interval change. Right upper lobe consolidation and bibasal opacities are unchanged. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. There is a temperature probe most likely in the very proximal esophagus and potentially need to be advanced.
