Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. In the interval since the prior study, there has been development of prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature. The perihilar opacity is worrisome for fluid overload, less likely infection. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
