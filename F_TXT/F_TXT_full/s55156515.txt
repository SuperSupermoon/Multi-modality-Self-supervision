The heart remains stably enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stably widened. There has been interval removal of the pericardial and left basilar pleural catheters with increasing opacity at the left base which may reflect reaccumulation of fluid and/or increasing consolidation. Patchy opacity at the right base is stable and likely reflects atelectasis. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
