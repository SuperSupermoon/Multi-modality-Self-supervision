The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with mild tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The lungs are well-expanded. Small nodular opacities are noted, most pronounced at the right lung base, with slight silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm, compatible with an infectious process. The upper abdomen is unremarkable in appearance.
