There is rotated positioning and the lower left chest wall is excluded from the film. A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle. Of note, the battery pack itself is excluded from these films and the contiguity with the pacemaker wires cannot be confirmed on this examination. No additional pacing device is appreciated on this view, but correlation with specifics of the clinical scenario is requested. The carina is not well visualized, but the ET tube appears to lie approximately 5.4 cm above the carina. There appears to be an NG tube present, but it cannot be traced below the level of the diaphragm. Interruption of the uppermost sternal wire again noted. There is increased retrocardiac density, probably similar to the prior film, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. The presence of a left effusion is difficult to assess due to positioning. Hazy density in the right lung suggests the presence of mild vascular plethora. No definite right effusion. Minimal atelectasis at the right base is similar to prior.
