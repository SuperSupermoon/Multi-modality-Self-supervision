In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. There is again opacification in the left mid and lower lung with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms that could reflect a combination of pleural fluid, atelectasis, and superimposed pneumonia. A lateral decubitus or CT would be necessary to assess for loculation of fluid. There is indistinctness of pulmonary markings when compared to the previous study on the right, consistent with developing pulmonary edema. On this side as well, there could be a developing consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting.
