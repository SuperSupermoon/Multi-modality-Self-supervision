The heart is mild to moderately enlarged. There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. There is perihilar fullness bilaterally with indistinct central pulmonary vascularity suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion or fluid overload. In addition, within the right lower lung, there is a potential focal developing opacity, so coinciding pneumonia could be considered. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
