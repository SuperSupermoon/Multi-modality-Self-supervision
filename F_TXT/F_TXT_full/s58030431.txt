AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lung volumes are quite low. There may be mild edema in the right lung. The left upper lobe appears to be hyperinflated in compensation for densely consolidated and presumably atelectatic left lower lobe. I see no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Heart is borderline enlarged, exaggerated by low lung volumes.
