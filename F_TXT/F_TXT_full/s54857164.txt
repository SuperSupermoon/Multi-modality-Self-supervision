Cavitated consolidation in the left upper lung is overall unchanged. Right basal bullous changes with more conspicuous thickened walls than expected based on recent CT findings. It is uncertain if this is due to surrounding fluid or secondary infectious process. Atelectasis and effusion is present at the left base. Tracheostomy tube is in appropriate position. Left subclavian line terminates in the proximal SVC. Enteric tube courses into the stomach and out of view.
