A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. There has been interval removal of the right internal jugular catheter. A PICC ends in the lower SVC. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Mild left basilar opacity has improved and is likely atelectasis and small pleural effusion as seen on chest CT. There is no pulmonary edema. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
