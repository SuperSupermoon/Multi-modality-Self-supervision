There has been interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions with none currently seen. The lungs are hyperinflated suggesting underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is diffuse increase in interstitial marking, possibly related to COPD. More focal left base opacity is seen, which could be due to pneumonia or aspiration. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
