As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously malpositioned nasogastric tube now shows a normal course and has its tip projecting over the stomach. The other monitoring and support devices are constant and unremarkable. The lung volumes have slightly decreased. There is a minimal increase in diameter of the pulmonary vessels. This could be indicative of mild fluid overload. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant, there is blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the presence of a small pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
