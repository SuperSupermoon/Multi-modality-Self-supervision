Comparison is made with prior studies performed four hours earlier. There has been recurrence of right lower lobe collapse. ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. NG tube tip is in the stomach. There are low lung volumes. Cardiac size is normal. Irregular opacities in the left lobe are grossly unchanged, likely pneumonia. There is no enlarging pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
