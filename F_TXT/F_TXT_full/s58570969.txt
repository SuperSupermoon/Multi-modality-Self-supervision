Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema/vascular congestion. More confluent medial right base opacity is seen, which likely represents confluence of vascular structures, although an early consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Difficult to exclude small left pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. If the patient able, dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.
