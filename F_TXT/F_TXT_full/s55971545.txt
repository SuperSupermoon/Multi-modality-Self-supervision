In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube, with its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. There appears to be some decrease in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, presumably reflecting some improvement in pulmonary vascular status. Marked dilatation of gas- loops of colon raise the possibility of colonic ileus.
