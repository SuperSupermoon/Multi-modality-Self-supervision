As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Left lower lobe opacity, likely atelectatic, combined to a relatively extensive left pleural effusion. Mild fluid overload with peribronchial cuffing, best visible in the perihilar right areas. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity. Unchanged monitoring and support devices. No pneumothorax.
