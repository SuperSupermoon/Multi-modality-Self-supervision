As compared to the previous radiograph, the air collection in the soft tissues has almost completely resolved. However, there is no evidence of moderate bilateral pleural effusions, combined to areas of atelectasis at both lung bases. The exact size of the cardiac silhouette can no longer be determined. The patient continues to be intubated, the nasogastric tube and the left subclavian line are unchanged in position. No pneumothorax. No pneumonia.
