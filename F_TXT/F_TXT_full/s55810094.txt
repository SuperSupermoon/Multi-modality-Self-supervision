A moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is minimally increased since the recent chest radiograph. Moderate left pleural effusion has increased as well and was previously smaller in size. This is accompanied by worsening opacities in the left retrocardiac region and a new area of poorly defined opacity in the left mid lung region. Considering the rapid development of the lateral opacity, acute aspiration should be considered.
