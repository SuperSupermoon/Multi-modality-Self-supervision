As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, reflecting a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia, have increased in severity. Also increased are the areas of retrocardiac atelectasis. The overall size of the cardiac silhouette is stable. No pneumothorax. Likely presence of small bilateral pleural effusions.
