Compared to prior film, a pigtail catheter has been placed, left chest and the previously seen left-sided pneumothorax is no longer visualized. Given the degree of subcutaneous emphysema and supine positioning, a small or anterior pneumothorax minor be apparent on this film. Chain sutures noted in the left upper zone medially. There is patchy opacity in the left infrahilar and left lung base which appears more pronounced than on the prior study. A platelike area of atelectasis has improved. The left costophrenic angle is blunted, which could reflect some pleural fluid. Deformity of the of a left posterior posterolateral mid chest rib is compatible with prior surgery or trauma. Subtle angulation of 2 ribs along the left lower chest raises a question of more recent fractures, the lesion on confirmed on any CT obtained approximately 3 hr earlier. Opacities at the right lung base are again seen, possibly slightly improved. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is compatible with a small effusion. There is vascular plethora, compatible with CHF. The ET tube , NG tube and right IJ line are nominal in position.
