AP chest compared to ___: With the chin in neutral position, tip of the endotracheal tube 12 mm from the carina is too low and it should be withdrawn 2 to 3 cm for standard placement. Dr. ___ paged at 11:15 a.m. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged since ___. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged. There is no good evidence for pneumonia, but recent aspiration could give a similar appearance to the left mid lung. Thickening of the left apical pleural margin developed between ___ and ___ has not resolved. Presumably, this is a hematoma, perhaps related to remote attempted line placement, but without evidence of active bleeding.
