ETT tip is in standard position. An enteric tube traverses the diaphragm with its tip not seen. The stomach is non-distended. Left jugular line is appropriately positioned. Dual lead cardiac device is overall unchanged in position with 1 tip ending in the right atrium and the other in the right ventricle. Right-sided pigtail catheter projects over the right hemithorax and right mediastinum and appears intact. Right upper lobe opacity persists, but lower lung opacities are significantly improved. The right pleural effusion appears resolved. Hazy opacification of the left costophrenic angle and the left lung base suggests persistent layering small pleural effusion. No change in retrocardiac opacity which may represent atelectasis, although focal consolidation cannot be excluded in appropriate clinical setting. No pneumothorax. Stable appearance of the cardial mediastinal silhouette without cardiomegaly.
