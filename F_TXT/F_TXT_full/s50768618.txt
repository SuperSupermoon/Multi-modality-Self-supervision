AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained on ___ at 9:35 p.m. There is a potential interval progression in the opacification of the entire right lung, more predominant in the right lower lobe as well as in the left perihilar area, findings and given the rapidity are more consistent with pulmonary edema. Massive aspiration or extremely rapid development of ARDS is less likely. Assessment of the patient after diuresis is recommended. The presence of Kerley B lines, which are new in the left lower lobe are also in favor of pulmonary edema.
