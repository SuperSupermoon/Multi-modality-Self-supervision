In comparison to the most recent prior radiograph, there appears to have been interval improvement in the multifocal opacities scattered throughout the lungs. The most prominent one remains in the left upper lobe. A PICC line is in appropriate positioning. No large pleural effusions. The endotracheal tube has been removed.
