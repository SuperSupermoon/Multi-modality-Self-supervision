AP chest compared to ___: The severely consolidated right lower lobe collapsed between ___ and ___ and has not re-expanded. Left lower lobe collapse on the same day, also not re-expanded, and both are accompanied by increasing moderate bilateral pleural effusion. Adjacent to a region of likely scarring in the right upper lobe, there is greater consolidation today than on ___, most likely another focus of pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Congestion in the upper lobes is attributable to re-direction of blood flow, if nothing else. A small collection of air projecting over the right diaphragmatic region could be pneumoperitoneum, and should be reevaluated with a repeat upright chest radiograph. Dr. ___ was paged at 2:15 p.m. as soon as the findings were recognized. Findings were discussed with the resident caring for this patient at 4 p.m.
