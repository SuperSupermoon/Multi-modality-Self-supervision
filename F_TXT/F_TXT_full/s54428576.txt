The cardiac silhouette is mild-to-moderately enlarged. The aorta is calcified. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis/scarring. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a subtle retrocardiac opacity projecting to the right of midline in the lower thorax, which may be due to overlapping structures; however, a dedicated PA and lateral views recommended and would be helpful for further evaluation to assess for persistence.
