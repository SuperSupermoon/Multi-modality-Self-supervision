AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina. The Dobbhoff tube tip passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Left basal opacity is a little bit more conspicuous concerning for potential atelectasis or aspiration.
