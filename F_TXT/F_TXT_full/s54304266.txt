Lung volumes are lower today exaggerating moderate to severe chronic enlargement of the cardiac silhouette due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion, as well as the severity of continued upper lobe pulmonary vascular engorgement, dilated mediastinal veins and the impact of the moderate right pleural effusion. The only possible interval change is new consolidation at the left lung base partially obscuring the cardiac apex. Given the low lung volumes. I suspect this is atelectasis. ET tube and Swan-___ catheter an transesophageal drainage tube are in standard placements respectively.
