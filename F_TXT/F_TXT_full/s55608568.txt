AP chest compared to ___, read in conjunction with imaging of the lower chest on ___ abdomen CT which showed very small right pleural effusion and right basal atelectasis and sufficient calcification in the aortic valve to raise question of hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis. Upper lungs are clear. Heart size is normal and there is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. New peribronchial opacification in the right lower lobe could be very early pneumonia or recent aspiration. Followup advised. Right subclavian central venous line ends low in the SVC. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
