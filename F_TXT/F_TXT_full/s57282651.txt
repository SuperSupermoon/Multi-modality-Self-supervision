As compared to the previous radiograph, lung volumes have decreased. There are newly appeared parenchymal opacities at the right and left lung base, likely reflecting atelectatic changes. However, the changes must be closely monitored to exclude early pneumonia. In addition, there is slight increase of the right mediastinal structures and a minimal increase of the cardiac silhouette, so that coexisting pulmonary edema cannot be excluded. Unchanged position of the nasogastric tube. No pneumothorax.
