Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is a very tiny right apical pneumothorax, which is unchanged. There are again seen bilateral pleural effusions with areas of consolidation in the right base. This likely represents partially loculated fluid. Heart size is upper limits of normal but stable. Overall, there has been no significant change.
