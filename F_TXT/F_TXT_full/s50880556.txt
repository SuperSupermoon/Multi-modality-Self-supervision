An endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are low with bibasilar atelectasis. Linear density projecting over the lateral left heart border may reflect a dense focus of linear atelectasis or pleural plaque. There is an apparent 1.5 cm cavitary lesion with a relatively thick rim in the lateral mid left lung. Mild cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion. The 2 most superior median sternotomy wires are fractured in multiple places. Pleural effusions are small, if any.
