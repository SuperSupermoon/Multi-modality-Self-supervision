Tip of right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the region of the cavoatrial junction. Other indwelling devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for patient's rotation. Pulmonary vascular congestion is present. Bibasilar opacities are again demonstrated, with interval worsening in the left retrocardiac region, and slight improvement in the right lower lobe, with improved visualization of the right hemidiaphragm. Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions are also demonstrated, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
