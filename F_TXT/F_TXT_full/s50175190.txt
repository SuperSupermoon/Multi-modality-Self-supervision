The right subclavian central line and right chest tube remain in place. There has been interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. There is a stable right apical lateral pneumothorax. Mild interstitial edema has improved. There is a small layering left effusion with retrocardiac consolidation which may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered given the presence of air bronchograms. Right paratracheal soft tissue is stable consistent with known lymphadenopathy. There is slight improvement in aeration at the right lung base. Overall cardiac contour is stable.
