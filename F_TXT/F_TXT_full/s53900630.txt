Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Allowing the difference in positioning of the patient, there has been interval increase in bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, consistent with worsening atelectasis and contusion. Aeration of the left upper lobe has improved. The cardiac silhouette is obscured by the lung abnormality. There is no evident pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusion. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC.
