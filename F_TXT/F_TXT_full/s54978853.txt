In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube appears to be in good position with the tip facing downward. There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion. Opacification at the right base probably reflects substantial volume loss in the lower lung. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. There are also probable bilateral pleural effusions.
