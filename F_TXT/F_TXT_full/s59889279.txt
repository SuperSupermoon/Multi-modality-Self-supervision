Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates multiple external EKG leads projecting over the thorax. There is slight patient rotation to the left. There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and decreased lung volume on the right. Compared to a week ago, there is mild improvement of pulmonary edema on the right, which remains persistent on the left. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears prominent but likely accentuated by low lung volume and AP technique. There is no large pleural effusion. Plate-like atelectasis is present at the right lung base.
