The patient is status post esophagectomy and pull-up procedure. Widening of right mediastinal contour is consistent with known neoesophagus which appears less distended than on the prior study, with air-fluid level at a lower level than on the prior exam. Adjacent patchy opacities in the right lower lobe are new, and could reflect atelectasis or aspiration in the setting of recent dilation procedure. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum following the procedure.
