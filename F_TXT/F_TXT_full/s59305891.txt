As compared to the previous image, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not visualized on the image. The patient also carries a left internal jugular vein hemodialysis catheter, with the tip projecting over the right atrium. A pre-existing right basal parenchymal opacity has almost completely resolved but on the left the extent of a pre-existing pleural effusion has slightly increased. Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis. No pulmonary edema.
