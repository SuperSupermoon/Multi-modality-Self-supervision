A portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal, allowing for a exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette related to low lung volumes. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
