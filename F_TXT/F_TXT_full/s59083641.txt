A right-sided chest tube is in place. Chain sutures are noted overlying the right apex. There is nonvisualization of pulmonary vessels at the extreme right lung apex. Although the edge of the lung is not well delineated, the possibility of a small right pneumothorax cannot be excluded. The lungs are otherwise clear without CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion. The mediastinum remains midline.
