In the interval since the prior study, a second right-sided chest tube has been placed. This appears to cross the midline and meet the left apex. There is a persistent small right apical pneumothorax. An opacity at the right lung base likely reflects a atelectasis. Subcutaneous emphysema again noted. The left lung appears grossly clear.
