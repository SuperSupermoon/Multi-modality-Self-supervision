Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen are chest tubes at the base of the right lung, where a small pneumothorax is seen, similar to prior. There is minimal residual atelectasis at the right lung base. No gross effusion. Cardiomediastinal and pulmonary findings are otherwise unchanged. Mild gaseous distension of the bowel, without frank dilatation is again noted.
