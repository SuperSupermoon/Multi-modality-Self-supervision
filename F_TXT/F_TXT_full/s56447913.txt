ETT is 4 cm above the carina. Enteric tube traverses the midline and its tip and side-port appear to be within the expected region of the stomach in the left upper quadrant. Lung volumes are very low with bronchovascular crowding. Platelike streaky opacities in the right lower lungs most likely reflect atelectasis. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may reflect atelectasis and or small pleural effusion. Retrocardiac opacity could be atelectasis or a focal pneumonia in the appropriate clinical situation, incompletely assessed on this single view. Heart size cannot be assessed on exam. No pneumothorax. No frank edema.
