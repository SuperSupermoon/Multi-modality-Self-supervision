The patient has been intubated. An endotracheal tube terminates about 6 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, where it terminates. The stomach is mildly distended. There is mild but increased left basilar opacity and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm suggesting atelectasis. Otherwise, evaluation of the lung parenchyma is obscured by a large pleural plaque involving the right hemithorax. There is no pneumothorax.
