AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___. Similar as identified on the preceding portable chest examination, the patient is status post sternotomy and previous bypass surgery. Heart size has not changed significantly. However, the pulmonary vascular pattern is congested with perivascular haze than before. As on the previous examination, there is evidence of an intraaortic balloon pump device seen to terminate in the proximal portion of the descending aorta just below the aortic arch in appropriate position. There is evidence of a new mediastinal drainage tube and two bilateral chest tubes advanced from below indicating new surgical intervention during the latest examination interval. No pneumothorax can be identified. An NG tube is seen reaching the lower esophagus, but apparently does not pass below the diaphragm. No new pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are seen.
