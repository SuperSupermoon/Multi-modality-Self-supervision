AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained five and a half hours earlier during the same day. During the examination interval, the left-sided lower chest tube has been removed. The left-sided pleural sinus remains free. No new infiltrates are seen. There is a small less than 1 cm wide apical pneumothorax on the left side. No major pulmonary collapse is noted and the right hemithorax is unremarkable.
