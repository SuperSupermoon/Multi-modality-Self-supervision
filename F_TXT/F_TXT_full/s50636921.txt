Multi focal pulmonary consolidation has worsened, which could be due to progression of infection or development of a transient pulmonary edema. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Pleural effusions are substantial but only slightly larger than before. No pneumothorax. ET tube and right PIC line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube passes through the nondistended stomach and out of view.
