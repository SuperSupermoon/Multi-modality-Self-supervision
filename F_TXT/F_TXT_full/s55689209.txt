Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Left lower lobe collapse has resolved. Cardiomediastinal contours are midline. Mild pulmonary edema is new. Cardiomegaly cannot be assessed. Right lower lobe opacities are a combination of effusion and atelectasis, grossly unchanged from prior study. Large left pleural effusion is probably present and unchanged, allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. There is persistent left perihilar opacities that are likely large areas of atelectasis. NG tube tip is in the distal stomach.
