No previous images. There is some hyperexpansion of the lungs with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Prominence of pulmonary markings could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, chronic lung disease, or both. There is mild asymmetry at the base with increased opacification on the right. This could merely reflect some asymmetric edema. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
