AP chest compared to ___: Large right pneumothorax is new, despite the pleural drain in the upper hemithorax. This probably explains substantial increase in subcutaneous emphysema. Right middle and lower lobe are now collapsed upwards, and the upper lobe is severely consolidated and may contain a central mass, abscess or hematoma. Mild edema in the left lung is new and needs to be followed to exclude a concurrent aspiration. Heart size is normal. Left internal jugular line is new, but unlikely to be the cause of the right pleural effusion. Indwelling right jugular line is unchanged in position, ending low in the SVC. Left subclavian introducer has been removed in the interim. Heart size normal. Nasogastric drainage tube ends in the stomach.
