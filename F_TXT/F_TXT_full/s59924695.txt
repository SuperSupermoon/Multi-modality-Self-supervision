There has been interval placement of a temporary pacing lead terminating in the region of the right ventricle via a right internal jugular approach. No pneumothorax. Lung volumes remain low. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. The aorta is markedly tortuous and diffusely calcified. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Linear retrocardiac opacity persists, likely atelectasis, without large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
