The patient is intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina. The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable. Contrast material is seen in the kidneys. There is moderate cardiomegaly with extensive left and right lower lobe atelectasis. In addition, there is a generalized massive and diffuse increase in lung density, showing multiple air bronchograms. Acute neurogenic edema or diffuse hemorrhage as well as ARDS might be potential differential diagnosis.
