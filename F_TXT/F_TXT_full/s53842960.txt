There is a new opacity within the medial right lung base obscuring the right heart border, findings which may reflect early developing pneumonia/aspiration and/or congestion. The remainder of the lungs are clear. There is no interstitial edema or large pleural effusions. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The descending thoracic aorta remains densely calcified though appears non-aneurysmal.
