Again seen are diffuse, bilateral interstitial opacities, greater on the right than on the left, with central pulmonary vascular congestion and scattered bronchial wall thickening. The main pulmonary artery is enlarged, stable since prior examinations. There is likely a small left pleural effusion, persistent since prior examinations. Ill-defined opacity in the right upper lung is likely a combination of Fissural fluid and adjacent atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, though infection is not excluded. A hiatal hernia is present. No pneumothorax is seen. Rightward tracheal deviation may be positional.
