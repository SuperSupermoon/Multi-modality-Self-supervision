A Swan-Ganz catheter tip now lies slightly more distal in the right pulmonary artery. Clinical correlation regarding slight retraction is requested. Again seen are diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities in both lungs. Allowing for technical differences, there appears to been slight improvement in the upper zone and along the upper periphery of both right and left lungs. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. No pneumothorax is detected. Small effusions cannot be excluded.
