As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Right pectoral pacemaker. Right chest tube. No evidence of pneumothorax. Unchanged dense and slightly enlarged right mediastinal structures. Minimally more obvious is a subtle pleural density at the site of chest tube insertion. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged normal appearance of the left hemithorax.
