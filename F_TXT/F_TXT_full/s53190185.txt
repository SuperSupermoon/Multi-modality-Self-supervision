Comparison is made with prior study ___. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Left PICC tip is in the mid SVC. There are lower lung volumes that accentuate the widened mediastinum and moderate cardiomegaly. Mild vascular congestion is new. Bibasilar opacities are accentuated by the low lung volumes consistent with increasing atelectasis. Patient has known severe emphysema. Irregular opacities in the left upper lobe are again noted. There are no new lung abnormalities.
