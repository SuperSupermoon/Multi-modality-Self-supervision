Since yesterday radiograph acquired approximately 20 hours apart, atelectasis bilateral lower lungs and the right middle lobe has increased as reflected by increased opacities. Ill-defined opacity in the right mid lung which is likely from aspiration is more conspicuous. The tip of the endotracheal tube ends 3.2 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, distal end is beyond radiograph view. Heart remains enlarged and calcified.
