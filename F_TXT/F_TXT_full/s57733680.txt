AP semi-upright portable view of the chest is provided. Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted. The patient is intubated with the endotracheal tube tip residing approximately 6.6 cm above the carina. There are coarsened interstitial markings noted bilaterally concerning for interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. There is a 2.5 x 3.3 cm opacity in the right suprahilar region, of unclear etiology. A small right pleural effusion may be present given the blunted right CP angle, though pleural thickening is also within the ddx. Comparison with prior imaging studies would be helpful to assess for any interval changes. The heart size is normal. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. No acute bony abnormalities.
