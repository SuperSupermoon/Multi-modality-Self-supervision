When compared to radiograph obtained 3 hr prior, there is been interval placement of a left anterior pigtail catheter. Previously seen left pneumothorax is decreased in size though persistent. Low lung volumes as well as bibasilar streaky opacities are again identified, likely reflective of atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged in appearance. There is no pleural effusion.
