ET tube remains in good position. VP shunt is partially assessed. There is worsening opacification in the left base with complete obscuration of left hemidiaphragm probably reflecting some atelectasis. In addition there is probably mild developing consolidation both right and left base. Some lucency projected over the lower left chest probably reflects some interposed Bowel rather than a deep sulcus though attention to this area is suggested on follow-up.
