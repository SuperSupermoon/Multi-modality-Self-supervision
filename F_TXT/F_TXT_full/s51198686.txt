There is a focal opacity in the left lower lung, partially obscuring the left cardiac silhouette. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is a large amount of relative lucency within the left lung, which is suggestive of emphysema. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
