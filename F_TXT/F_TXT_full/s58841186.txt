1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning. There has been interval improvement but persistent bilateral airspace process suggestive of resolving pulmonary edema. More focal airspace consolidation at the left base may reflect compressive atelectasis in the setting of an effusion; however, an acute infectious process cannot be excluded, especially in a patient with a rising white count. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax.
