Comparison is made with prior study, CT ___. Large left pleural effusion has markedly decreased, now small. There is no evident pneumothorax. Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable due to known right hilar mass. Small right pleural effusion is associated with adjacent atelectasis. Left lower lobe atelectasis has improved.
