Interval extubation. Interval change in position of distal aspect of right pigtail pleural catheter, with unchanged small right pleural effusion and no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present. Cavitary lesion in right juxtahilar region is similar to the prior study, but right lower lobe opacities with associated volume loss have slightly worsened. Within the left lung, heterogeneous opacities in the left juxtahilar region and left lower lobe have slightly worsened. These findings may be due to worsening multifocal pneumonia, with or without a component of coexisting pulmonary edema.
