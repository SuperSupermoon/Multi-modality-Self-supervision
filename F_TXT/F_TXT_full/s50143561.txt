AP chest compared to ___, 7:51 p.m.: Left pleural collection has decreased, and pneumothorax could be moderate in size, difficult to delineate, despite three left pleural tubes in place. Atelectasis in the left lung is substantial but improved. The important development is a new large area of opacity at the periphery of the right upper lobe marginated by the minor fissure. There is suggestion of a convex inner margin, which is the morphology associated with pulmonary infarction, but this could also be pneumonia, particularly aspiration since the patient was most likely right decubitus during surgery. Heart is normal size to slightly bigger. ET tube is in standard placement and an upper enteric drainage tube ending in the upper stomach, would need to be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. No pneumothorax on the right.
