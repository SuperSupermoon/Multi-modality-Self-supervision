Oro-gastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach but its distal end is off radiographic view. Retained barium material is present in the stomach. There is a single right pleural chest tube coursing till the apex and there are two left chest tubes, one ending near the left apex and another one in the left lung base. Bilateral pleural effusions are mild and associated bibasilar opacities, is presumably atelectasis. There is no appreciable pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. ETT tip ends approximately 4.5 cm above the carina and is appropriate. A single-lead on the right side ends into the right atrium.
