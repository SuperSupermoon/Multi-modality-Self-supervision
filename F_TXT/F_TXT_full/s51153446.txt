AP portable semi upright view of the chest. Multiple overlying leads limit the assessment. The lungs are grossly clear. A retrocardiac opacity containing gas may represent a hiatal hernia. No overt signs of pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion again noted. Subtle opacity in the right mid lung at the site of multiple rib fractures likely represents chronic pleural thickening versus loculated pleural effusion. No convincing evidence for pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged. No significant change from prior.
