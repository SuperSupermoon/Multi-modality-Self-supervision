As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The parenchymal opacities in the left lung apex are constant in appearance. Postoperative tracheal deviation to the right, without obvious increase in left paratracheal soft tissue densities. Minimally increasing areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung base. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
