The tip of a right-sided PICC line is difficult to visualize but is probably unchanged. The lung volumes remain low. There is an extensive consolidation in the right lower lung, probably in the right lower lobe. The appearance is fairly similar to the more recent prior radiographs allowing for differences in technique although pulmonary vasculature is somewhat less prominent. It is difficult to exclude small pleural effusions but no definite pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged, including cardiac enlargement.
