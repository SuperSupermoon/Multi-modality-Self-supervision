An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and terminates in the left upper quadrant in the stomach. The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated. The thoracic aorta is tortuous with prominence of the ascending aorta. No infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax is identified. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant are compatible with prior cholecystectomy. Spiral tacks overlying the mid abdomen are compatible with prior ventral hernia repair.
