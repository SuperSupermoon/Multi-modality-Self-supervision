1. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. Lung volumes remain low with patchy opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, although they are somewhat difficult to assess due to patient rotation on the current study. No pleural effusions. No large pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
