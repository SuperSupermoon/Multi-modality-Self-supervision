AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 12 hours earlier during the same date. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. The same holds for the right subclavian central venous line terminating in the lower SVC. A newly placed NG tube is seen to reach well into the stomach and terminates pointing towards the pylorus just about to enter the duodenum. No other significant interval changes can be identified. Comparison of the pulmonary vasculature suggests that the episode of pulmonary congestion encountered 12 hours ago has again normalized and is similar to that observed on the morning of ___.
