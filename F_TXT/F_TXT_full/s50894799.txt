AP chest compared to ___ through ___: With the chin elevated, tip of the endotracheal tube, no more than 15 mm above the carina is below optimal placement and it should be withdrawn 2.5 cm at least. Lung volumes remain quite low and there is substantial bibasilar atelectasis, worse today than yesterday. Upper lungs are grossly clear, pleural effusions are small, if any. Heart size is top normal, exaggerated by low lung volumes also responsible in part for apparent widening of the upper mediastinum, though I believe that mediastinal veins are dilated. No pneumothorax is present.
