Compared with the supine trauma board film obtained earlier the same day, the current film is also obtained supine, with slightly better, but still low, inspiratory volumes. As before, the mediastinum appears prominent and there is probable mild cardiomegaly. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. There is bibasilar atelectasis, slightly improved at the left base. No effusion. No apical capping is suggested. No pneumothorax is detected.
