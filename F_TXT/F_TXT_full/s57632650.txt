Since the prior radiograph there are new near confluent opacities throughout the right lung. The left lung appears relatively clear. The small left pleural effusion is present. No pneumothorax identified. The size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. The tip of the left central venous catheter projects over the mid SVC. The endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea and a feeding tube extends beyond the field of view of this radiograph.
