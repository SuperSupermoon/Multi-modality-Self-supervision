Endotracheal tube is 4.4 cm above the carina, unchanged and appropriately sited. There is a new nasogastric tube whose side port is at the GE junction and could be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal placement. There is unchanged cardiomegaly and a left retrocardiac opacity. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion and atelectasis at the lung bases. Vague opacity in the right upper lobe is seen and attention to this area is recommended on subsequent exams to exclude developing pneumonia.
