Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.8 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. There are slightly low lung volumes. Right mid to lower lung atelectasis is seen. Mild perihilar opacities may be due to a component of edema although underlying aspiration is not excluded. There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, most likely due to overlying soft tissues; no large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. The mediastinum is likely accentuated by low lung volumes, and AP technique; if there is concern for acute mediastinal/aortic process, consider CT.
