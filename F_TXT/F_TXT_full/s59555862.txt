The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 3.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its tip not imaged. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava. A left upper lobe opacity has mostly resolved suggesting improving atelectasis. However, there are new opacities developing at both lung bases which are not specific, but could often be seen with atelectasis and possibly coinciding pleural effusions. The pulmonary vasculature is prominent and indistinct with a mild interstitial abnormality, suggesting mild pulmonary edema.
