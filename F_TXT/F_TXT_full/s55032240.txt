A right subclavian catheter has been placed in the interim. The catheter terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava and, if indicated, could be advanced 3.7 cm for termination within the low SVC. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. There is no focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. High density material is again seen in the paritally imaged colon in the left abdomen. Cholecystectomy clips are noted. There are carotid calcifications, left greater than right.
