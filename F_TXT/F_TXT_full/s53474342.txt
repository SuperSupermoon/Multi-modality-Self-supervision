As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a stent in the left main stem bronchus. The patient also is intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.7 cm above the carina. There is a new parenchymal opacity, surrounding the known mass in the right lower lung, that shows air bronchograms and could reflect either infection, aspiration or bleeding. The overall volume of the left hemithorax is substantially reduced. No pathological parenchymal changes in the left lung.
