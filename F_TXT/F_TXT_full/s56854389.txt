Left-sided chest pigtail catheter is seen projecting over the lateral left lower chest. There are low lung volumes. There has been slight interval increase in right base opacity which may be due to underlying atelectasis although developing consolidation is not excluded. There has been continued improvement in left base opacity/pleural effusion.
