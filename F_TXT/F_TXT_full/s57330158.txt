Newly placed endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.6 cm above the carina, and a nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm. A 3-cm diameter rounded lucency is identified lateral to the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube to the left of midline. Although potentially representing an over-distended endotracheal tube cuff, the position is more lateral than expected for this condition. Alternative possibilities include an air-filled diverticulum arising from the trachea or esophagus. Findings were communicated by telephone with Dr. ___ on ___ at 4:00 p.m. at the time of discovery. Exam is otherwise remarkable for persistent cardiomegaly and worsening congestive heart failure with increasing perihilar edema and persistent small right pleural effusion.
