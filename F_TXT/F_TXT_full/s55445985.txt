Tracheostomy ends 3.5 cm above the carina. Dobbhoff tube is in the stomach. The patient is known with right apical mass invading the ribs and vertebral body. Increased opacification in both lungs since yesterday is compatible with worsening of moderate pulmonary edema. Bilateral moderate pleural effusion on the left side and severe on the right side is unchanged. A more focal area around the left hilum is unchanged and could be compatible with loculated pleural effusion in the fissure as seen on yesterday's CT. Right apical pneumonia seen on previous CT is hard to assess on this chest x-ray. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax.
