Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened. Cardiomegaly is stable. Widened mediastinum due to vascular engorgement is stable. Bilateral effusions are probably unchanged on the right and minimally increased on the left allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Right PICC tip is in at the cavoatrial junction. Spinal hardware is again noted.
