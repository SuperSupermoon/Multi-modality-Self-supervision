Interval development of left lung extensive consolidation might represent a combination of aspiration and atelectasis. Bleeding is another possibility. There is also increase in the right upper lobe opacification that might be related to this same source. Left mediastinal shift correlates with the presence of atelectasis. Small amount of pleural effusion is most likely bilateral. No pneumothorax demonstrated.
