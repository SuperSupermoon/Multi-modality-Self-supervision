1. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, left internal jugular introducer catheter unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning. Spinal hardware overlies mid to lower thoracic spine. 2. Bilateral layering effusions with persistent retrocardiac opacity and fluctuating somewhat improved right basilar opacity. These likely reflect layering effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There is fullness of the hilar vessels but no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
