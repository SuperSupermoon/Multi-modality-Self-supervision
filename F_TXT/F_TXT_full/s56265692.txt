There is slightly improved aeration at the left lung base with persistent retrocardiac opacification and air bronchograms projecting the left heart border. Opacification at the right lung base is unchanged. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Mild calcification of the aortic knob is again noted.
