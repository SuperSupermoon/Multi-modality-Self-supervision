There is increased pulmonary vascular congestion bilaterally consistent with volume overload. This can be due to decompensated heart failure, renal failure or both. Heart is markedly enlarged as seen on the prior study. Although there are no discrete focal areas of consolidation, a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. No significant pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
