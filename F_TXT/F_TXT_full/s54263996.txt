AP chest compared to ___ at 5:23 p.m. and preoperative chest radiograph ___. Previous rightward shift of the upper mediastinum has improved. This probably was lobar atelectasis, although I am not sure whether it was right upper or middle lobe collapse. Small localized pleural fluid collection remains but there is no appreciable pneumothorax, apical pleural tube unchanged in position. Small region of opacification in each lower lung is presumably atelectasis, but should be followed to exclude the possibility of pneumonia developing following aspiration. Left upper lung is clear. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax.
