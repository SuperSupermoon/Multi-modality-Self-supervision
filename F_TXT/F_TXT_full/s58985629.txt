There is rotated positioning. Probable background COPD. Mild cardiomegaly, with calcified slightly unfolded aorta. There is slight upper zone redistribution, but I doubt overt CHF. There is atelectasis the left lung base, without definite consolidation. No gross left effusion. There is hazy obscuration of the right lung base raising the question of a small effusion and/or atelectasis. No definite consolidation. Due to patient rotation, the previously seen large right-sided thyroid mass, possibly a goiter, which compresses and displaces the trachea, is less well delineated, but probably similar to the prior study. Known recent fracture of the left anterior second rib is not well depicted radiographically.
