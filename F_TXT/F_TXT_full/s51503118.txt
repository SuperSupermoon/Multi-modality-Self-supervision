There is interval placement of an NG tube that is coiled in the stomach. Right chest tube and ET tube are unchanged in position. Interstitial changes which are due to pre-existing interstitial lung disease, now appear slightly less prominent; the decreased prominence is likely due to decreased vascular congestion. No definite pleural effusion is seen. Moderate cardiomegaly is seen.
