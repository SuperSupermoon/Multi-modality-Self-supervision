As compared ___ chest radiograph, asymmetrical pulmonary edema has nearly resolved with mild residual interstitial edema remaining. Right pleural effusion has decreased in size with residual small to moderate effusion remaining, and a small left pleural effusion is not appreciably changed. Small lucency adjacent to right hemidiaphragm is likely due to normally aerated lung abutting the diaphragm. However, there is clinical suspicion for free intraperitoneal air, left lateral decubitus radiograph may be helpful to exclude this possibility.
