Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian PICC line remain in place. Stable postoperative changes are seen in the left hemithorax. Overall, there is worsening severe pulmonary edema and there are likely associated layering effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the diffuse airspace process and patient rotation on the current study.
