The post pneumonectomy appearance of the right hemithorax is unchanged. Airspace opacities at the left base may be due to infection, but it is difficult to discern how much of the left basilar opacification is actually due to layering pleural effusion. There is no left pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be accurately assessed.
