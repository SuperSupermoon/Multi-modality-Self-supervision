Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, a Swan-Ganz catheter has been placed, terminating in the interlobar right pulmonary artery. Endotracheal tube terminates 5.4 cm above the carina, and a right internal jugular vascular sheath terminates in the upper superior vena cava. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is new as well as patchy atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region. Additionally, a poorly defined opacity is present in the periphery of the right mid lung region and may reflect patchy atelectasis or aspiration in the recent postoperative setting.
