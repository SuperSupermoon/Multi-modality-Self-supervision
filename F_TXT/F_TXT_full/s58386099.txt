The ET tube is approximately 5.7 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm with the tip not visualized in the field of view provided. There is cardiomegaly and vascular engorgement, as well as interstitial edema. Widening of left mediastinal contour probably reflects accentuation of a tortuous aorta by patient rotation, but this area should be re-evaluated on a non-rotated CXR. Small left pleural effusion is noted as well as peripheral left basilar lung opacity, which could reflect atelectasis, aspiration or focal pneumonia. There is trace right intrafissural fluid. No rib fractures identified. If there is continued concern for rib fractures, then a dedicated rib series can be obtained. Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 10am on ___ via telephone.
