Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Again the patient's trachea is deviated to the right with a left-sided density consistent with enlarged thyroid. Questionable blunting of the left costophrenic angle is felt to most likely be due to overlying soft tissue. No definite focal consolidation. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.
