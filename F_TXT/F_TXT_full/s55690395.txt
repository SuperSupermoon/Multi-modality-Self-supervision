AP frontal portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated to the left and is likely kyphotic in position. Due to patient positioning, the examination is quite suboptimal. There are patchy bibasilar opacities, which could relate to atelectasis, but underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude. It is also difficult to exclude small bilateral pleural effusions. No large pneumothorax is seen. Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to patient positioning. Cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged. There are low lung volumes. Also, the right humeral head appears subluxed in relation to the right glenoid, not optimally evaluated on this study.
