Mild to moderate pulmonary edema has worsened throughout the lungs obscuring what was initially more conspicuous consolidation in the left lower lobe, which is presumably still present. Findings suggest left lower lobe pneumonia with concurrent worsening pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal.
