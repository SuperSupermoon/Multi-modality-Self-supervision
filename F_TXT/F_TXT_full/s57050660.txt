ET tube present, tip approximately 3.1 cm above the carina. Right-sided PICC line again noted. There are low inspiratory volumes, likely accounting for the upper zone re-distribution and possibly also for the right base atelectasis. There is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and probable left effusion. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle, consistent with a small amount of right pleural fluid. Compared with ___ at 4:07 a.m., no definite interval change.
