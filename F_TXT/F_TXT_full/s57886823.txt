Pulmonary edema, most evident in the right mid and lower lung on ___ has nearly cleared. Vascular generally is engorged, including both hila, and mediastinal veins. New lobulation to the left hilus and region of the aortopulmonic window in the mediastinum could be due to larger pulmonary arteries, but could be due to increasing adenopathy as well. There is no pneumonia or appreciable pleural effusion. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses from the left pectoral generator.
