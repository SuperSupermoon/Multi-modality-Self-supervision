Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is cardiomegaly. Tracheostomy is again seen. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour. There is prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings. There is again seen a prominent mediastinum; however, this is consistent with known heterogeneous substernal goiter as seen on the prior chest CT. There is a vascular catheter seen in the axilla on the right side.
