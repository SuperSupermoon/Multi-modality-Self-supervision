As compared to the previous radiograph, the two pigtail catheters were removed and a new chest tube was inserted on the left. The left lung is substantially better expanded than on the previous image. An area of atelectasis persists in the mid and low left lung regions. Miniscule pneumothorax is still evident at the left lung base ascending the paramediastinal left lung areas. No evidence of tension. Unchanged appearance of the right lung.
