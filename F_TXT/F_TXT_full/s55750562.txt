AP chest compared to ___ and ___ at 5:56 a.m.: Lung volumes have improved since over the past hour, and although there is still pulmonary vascular engorgement, edema is improving as well. There is only a relatively small volume of decreasing right pleural effusion. Extensive right lung consolidation is less prominent, which could be due to genuine improvement in widespread bronchopneumonia or in radiographic improvement due to decreasing edema. Distortion of the proximal left humerus could be an artifact of positioning or an old fracture deformity.
