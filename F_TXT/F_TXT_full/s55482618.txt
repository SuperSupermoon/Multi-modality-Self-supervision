1. Interval placement of the Dobbhoff feeding tube which courses below the diaphragm and the tip projects over the expected location of the stomach. Right internal jugular central line with its tip projecting at the level of the cavoatrial junction. The patient's mandible obscures the apices and the patient is markedly rotated, limiting evaluation of the cardiac views mediastinal contours, although the heart remains enlarged and may reflect cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion. There continue to be low lung volumes with layering bilateral effusions, right greater than left as well as consolidation in the retrocardiac region which may represent partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Pulmonary vasculature looks more ill defined on the current study, which raises concern for mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax is appreciated. Status post median sternotomy.
