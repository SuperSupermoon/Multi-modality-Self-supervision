Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. A moderate to large hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated. The lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted. Ill-defined opacity within the right upper lobe is unchanged, and previously described lesion concerning for neoplasm within the left upper lobe appears relatively unchanged, but better demonstrated on recent CT. Bronchial wall thickening with mild interstitial abnormality within the lung bases likely reflects bronchiolitis, perhaps minimally improved compared to the previous CT. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
