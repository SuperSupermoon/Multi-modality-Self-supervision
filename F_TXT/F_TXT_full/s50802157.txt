Comparison is made to previous study from five hours earlier. Bilateral pleural effusions are again seen, right side worse than left. There is cardiomegaly. There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings. There is a right IJ catheter with distal lead tip in the right atrium. This could be pulled back 4 cm for more optimal placement. There is calcification adjacent to the soft tissues of the right shoulder which can be seen with calcific tendinitis or tumoral calcinosis.
