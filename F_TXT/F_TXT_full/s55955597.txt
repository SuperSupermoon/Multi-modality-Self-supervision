As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of a retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms that could potentially reflect pneumonia. Given the overall decrease in lung volumes as compared to the previous examination, there also is an increase in radiodensity at the right lung base. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. There are no pleural effusions and no pneumothorax. Minimal pulmonary edema could be present. The previously seen overinflation of the stomach is completely resolved. The vertebral stabilization devices are constant in appearance.
