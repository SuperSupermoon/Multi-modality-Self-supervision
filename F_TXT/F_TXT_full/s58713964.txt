Diffuse interstitial abnormality in the lungs, predominantly in the upper lobes as seen on prior CT chest, is consistent with fibrosis from known sarcoidosis.

Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged given differences and technique. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The osseous structures are intact.
