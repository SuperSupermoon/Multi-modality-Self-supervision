A portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of an endotracheal tube, with right mainstem intubation and mild atelectasis of the left lung. The right lung is clear. The nasoenteric tube courses below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image. A right central line terminates in the mid SVC, likely unchanged in position compared to the recent chest radiograph, but now with improved lung volumes. A device projecting over the left scapula may represent a nerve stimulator. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant are likely related to prior cholecystectomy. Pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
