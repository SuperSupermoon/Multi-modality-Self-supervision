Since the prior radiograph, there is a new heterogeneous opacity at the right lung base with suggestion of a small right pleural effusion. Lungs are otherwise notable for increased interstitial markings bilaterally likely due to chronic disease as seen on prior CT scan. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.No pneumothorax. Old bilateral rib fractures are again seen.
