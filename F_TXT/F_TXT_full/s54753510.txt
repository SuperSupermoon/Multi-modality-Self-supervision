As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right-sided chest tube. The right lung is now fully expanded. However, there are signs of interstitial fluid overload, strongly suggestive of reexpansion pulmonary edema. The crowding of the vascular structures on the left is unchanged. Unchanged endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
