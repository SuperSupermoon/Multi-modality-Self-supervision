Left PICC has been re-positioned, now terminating in the mid-to-lower superior vena cava. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Assessment of the lungs is somewhat limited by low lung volumes and portable technique. Known subpleural parenchymal opacities on recent CT torso are not well demonstrated radiographically except for a subtle area of opacity at the right lung base.
