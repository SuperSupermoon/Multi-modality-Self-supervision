As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing atelectasis at the right lung base has almost completely resolved. The right lung base is better ventilated than on the previous radiograph. Likewise, a pre-existing opacity at the right lung base is substantially improved. However, in the interval, the patient has developed mild to moderate pulmonary edema. A new retrocardiac atelectasis is visualized. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. No larger pleural effusions. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
