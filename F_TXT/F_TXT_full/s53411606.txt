Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is spinal hardware which appears intact. There are opacities in the lower lungs and a left-sided pleural effusion. This appears stable. There are no pneumothoraces. Endotracheal tube tip is slightly low, 2 cm above the carina. This could be pulled back 1 to 2 cm for more optimal placement. There is a nasogastric tube whose distal tip and side port are below the GE junction.
