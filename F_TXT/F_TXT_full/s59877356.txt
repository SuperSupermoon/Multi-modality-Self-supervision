Compared with the immediate prior radiographs, there is no relevant change. The endotracheal tube, enteric tube, and right IJ CVC are all in unchanged standard position. There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. A large layering left pleural effusion with associated compressive atelectasis is unchanged. There is probably a small to moderate right pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
