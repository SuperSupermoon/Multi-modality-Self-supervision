Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion. No displaced osseous injury is evident. A 6-mm well-circumscribed radiodensity projecting over the right humeral head may represent a bone island, but is not encompassed on preceding radiographs of the chest.
