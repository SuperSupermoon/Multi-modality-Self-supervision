In comparison to the prior study, there are minimally increased bibasilar interstitial opacities likely reflecting atelectasis. Otherwise, little interval change. There is upper zone redistribution, unchanged, but no overt CHF. No focal consolidation or effusion identified. Triple-lead ICD device again noted. (Inferior extent of heart and inferior most lead excluded from this film.) There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly, with an unfolded aorta. Calcifications projecting over the left ventricle are suggestive of prior infarction. There is prominence of the pulmonary hila, with a tapered configuration, probably unchanged, which may reflect pumonary hypertension.
