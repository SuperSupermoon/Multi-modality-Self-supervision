1. Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is limited due to marked patient rotation on the current study. The endotracheal tube lies 3.6-cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There continue to be bilateral layering effusions, left greater than right. There is fullness of the perihilar vasculature which likely represents mild perihilar edema. It has not significantly changed since the prior study. Bibasilar patchy opacities most likely reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Multiple left-sided posterolateral rib fractures. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
