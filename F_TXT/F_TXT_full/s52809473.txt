Since ___, moderate right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis and increased retrocardiac density suggesting left lower lung volume loss has worsened. Because of the increased retrocardiac density more of the left lower lung is obscured limiting comparison for changes in the previous mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion. Right HD catheter and left subclavian line ends at lower SVC. Orogastric tube is seen to cross below the diaphragm into the stomach, however the distal end is beyond the view of radiograph. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6.4 cm above the carina and appears highly positioned. Considering advancing the ET tube by additional 2 cm for better seating.
