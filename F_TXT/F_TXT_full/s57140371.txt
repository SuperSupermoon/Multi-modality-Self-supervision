The NG tube tip is in the stomach. There is dense retrocardiac opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. There is diffuse increase in interstitial markings, right greater than left and it is unclear if this is secondary to asymmetric pulmonary edema or an infectious process. There is volume loss in the right lower lobe as well. The heart is moderately enlarged and is larger than on the prior study. There are bilateral effusions, left greater than right.
