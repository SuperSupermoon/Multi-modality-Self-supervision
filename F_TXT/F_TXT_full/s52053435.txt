The patient has received an intra-aortic balloon pump. The tip of the inflated pump projects several millimeters below the upper aspect of the aortic arch. The pump should be pulled back by approximately 1 cm. The previously seen diffuse parenchymal opacities are improved. However, an atelectatic lung portion projects over the aortic knob and deserves attention on following radiographs. The size of the heart is unchanged. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
