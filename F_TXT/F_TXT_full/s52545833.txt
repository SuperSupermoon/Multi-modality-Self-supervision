There is moderately severe pulmonary edema. In comparison to the prior study performed 1 hour earlier, there is increasing opacification of the left hemithorax which may be due to a combination of layering pleural effusion and pulmonary edema. A moderate/large left pleural effusion also appears to be slightly increased. No pneumothorax. Heart size is moderately enlarged. There has been interval placement of a left subclavian line which terminates in the brachiocephalic vein. Endotracheal tube is again noted to terminate approximately 7.3 cm above the carina. Inferior tip of the enteric tube is not visualized.
