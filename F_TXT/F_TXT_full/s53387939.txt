AP chest compared to ___:53 a.m.: Tip of the newly placed intra-aortic catheter pump is midway between the upper margin of the left main bronchus and the apex of the aortic arch. Swan-Ganz catheter loops in the right atrium and barely crosses the tricuspid valve. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach, where it probably loops, terminating in the gastric fundus. Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved, dense consolidation in the left lower lobe, most commonly atelectasis, but conceivably pneumonia, has not. Moderate cardiomegaly is slightly worse, but there is little if any pulmonary edema. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged and there is no pneumothorax. Clinical service was notified by telephone at 8:25 a.m.
