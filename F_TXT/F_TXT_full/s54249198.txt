AP chest compared to ___: Patient has persistent moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement. The lower lungs are largely obscured by heavy asbestos-related pleural calcifications. There could be atelectasis or consolidation in the right lower lobe, but the findings could actually be minimal. If the determination of the presence of any consolidation is of high clinical importance, I would recommend CT scanning. Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
