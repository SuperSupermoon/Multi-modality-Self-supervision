AP chest compared to ___ at 11:45 a.m.: Since ___:45 a.m., mild pulmonary edema has worsened in the right and mid and upper zones of the left lung. There has been a substantial increase in consolidation at the base of the left lung which could be dependent edema or concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. Small pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial. There is no pneumothorax. Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter ends in the region of the pulmonic valve, as before. ET tube is in standard placement. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach but would need to be advanced at least 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction.
