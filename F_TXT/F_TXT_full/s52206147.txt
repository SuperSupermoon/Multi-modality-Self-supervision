In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a slightly better inspiration. There is still enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with retrocardiac opacification and blunting of the costophrenic angle, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. At the right, there are some basilar atelectatic changes with blunting of the costophrenic angle, consistent with a smaller pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits.
