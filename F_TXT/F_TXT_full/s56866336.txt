Single portable frontal chest x-ray demonstrates no acute intrathoracic process. Blunting of the costophrenic angles with fluid seen in the minor fissure represents trace bilateral pleural effusions which are unchanged from prior study. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged with stable left ventricular predominance. Calcifications are again noted within the aortic arch, as are clips within the left neck. There is no pneumothorax. There are no suspicious osseous lesions.
