The lungs are well expanded and clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no evidence of fracture. Of note, chest radiographs are not designed to detect subtle changes in pulmonary parenchyma such as contusions. If clinical concern is high, focal views could be pursued for further assessment.
