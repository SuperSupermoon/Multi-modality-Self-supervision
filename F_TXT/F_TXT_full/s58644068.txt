The lungs are poorly expanded. There are no focal opacities in the right lung. The left lung demonstrates stable opacity at the lateral left lung base representing post op changes with scarring/atelectasis, stable compared to multiple priors. Mild cardiomegaly is again noted. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable otherwise. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Prominent vascular calcifications are noted at the level of the aortic knob. Fracture deformity of the posterolateral left sixth rib. External monitoring devices are present.
