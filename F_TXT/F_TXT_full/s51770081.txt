In comparison with the study of ___, there has been some decrease in the opacification at the left base suggesting some improved consolidation. However, opacification in the retrocardiac region persists, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Monitoring and support devices are unchanged, except for removal of the left subclavian catheter. The right lung is essentially clear and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
