A Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen extending to the level of the diaphragm with the weighted tip extending just below the diaphragm, which should be advanced further for appropriate positioning. A small right pleural effusion is present. The lungs are otherwise clear with resolution of previous bibasilar opacities. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
