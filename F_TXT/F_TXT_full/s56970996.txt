AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. No previous chest examination available for comparison. The heart size is normal. No configurational abnormality is seen. Thoracic aorta unremarkable. There exists an elevated left-sided diaphragm. The elevation may partially be related to significantly gas-distended stomach. There is no evidence of pleural effusion as the lateral pleural sinus is free. There is significant elevation of the left-sided hilum probably related to some linear densities directed towards the left-sided lung apex. Skeletal structures of the first rib and clavicle, however, are obscuring the area significantly. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. The right hemithorax does not show any distortion of the hilar structures, but the pulmonary vasculature is rather sparse giving the impression of hyperinflated lungs bilaterally. Skeletal structures are somewhat demineralized and on the right side one can see an apparent old rib fracture of the ninth rib posteriorly with typical bridging callus formation. There exists no prior chest examinations in our records available for comparison. Elevated left hilum probably related to old specific infection in left upper lobe. Elevation of left-sided hemidiaphragm, cause unknown. General impression of rather advanced pulmonary hyperinflation (emphysema). Evidence of old rib fracture on right side. Recommend further workup unless clinical situation has been worked up at other institution. Referring physician ___. ___ was reached by telephone at 3:30 p.m.
