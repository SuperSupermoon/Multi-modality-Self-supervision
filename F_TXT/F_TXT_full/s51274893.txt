The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 7 cm above the carina near the thoracic inlet. An orogastric tube enters the stomach, where it makes a single coil. The heart is normal in size. There is mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. The aortic arch is calcified. There is flattening of the left costophrenic angle suggesting there may be a small pleural effusion or perhaps chronic scarring or plate-like atelectasis at this site. Moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is noted with streaky opacities at the right lung base suggesting minor atelectasis. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
