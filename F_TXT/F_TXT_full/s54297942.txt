There is a right-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip in the proximal right atrium, unchanged. Heart size is prominent but stable. There is increased in the pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of mild to moderate pulmonary edema. There is an opacity at the right base which likely represents developing infiltrate and/or pleural effusion. No pneumothoraces are seen.
