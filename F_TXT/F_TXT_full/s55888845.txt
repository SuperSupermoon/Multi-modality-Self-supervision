Pulmonary edema has improved, now mild in the right lung. Left suprahilar opacification is greater than elsewhere, either asymmetric edema or concurrent pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. Moderate cardiomegaly with a left atrial configuration is stable. No pneumothorax. ET tube, transesophageal drainage tube, and intra-aortic balloon pump are in standard placements respectively.
