As compared ___ chest radiograph, cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Patchy and linear left basilar opacities have slightly worsened and are likely due to atelectasis although superimposed aspiration or developing infection are also possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Small left pleural effusion has apparently slightly increased in size. No other relevant changes.
