As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient continues to be intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 4 cm above the carinal. The course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged. The lung volumes have slightly decreased, with resulting retrocardiac atelectasis that is now visible. Otherwise the lung parenchyma shows no change. No change in size of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions.
