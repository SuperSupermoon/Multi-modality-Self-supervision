Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Substantial lymphadenopathy appears to be unchanged since the prior study. Extensive interstitial reticulonodular markings more prominent on the right but also present on the left as well as left suspected pleural effusion are re-demonstrated. There is no pneumothorax and there is no interval development of substantial pleural fluid. Elevated left hemidiaphragm is noted, and new as compared to ___. It potentially may reflect interval involvement of the phrenic nerve by the lymphadenopathy or as previously suspected partial atelectasis of the left upper lobe after placement of the endobronchial stent.
