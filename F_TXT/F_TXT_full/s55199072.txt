Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. There is bibasilar opacity, likely atelectasis, though a component of aspiration not excluded. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly unremarkable aside from an unfolded partially calcified thoracic aorta. No definite bony injuries are seen.
