In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing opacification at the left base with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed aspiration or infectious pneumonia would have to be considered. On the left, the hemidiaphragm is sharply seen with only mild atelectatic changes at this time. Otherwise, little overall change in this patient with a tracheostomy tube in place.
