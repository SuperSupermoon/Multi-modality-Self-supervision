AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 12 hours earlier during the same day. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. During the interval, an NG tube has been placed seen to reach well below the diaphragm into the fundus of the stomach. No pneumothorax or any other placement-related complication can be identified. No new pulmonary infiltrates. Cardiomegaly with a relative prominence of main pulmonary artery segment on frontal view appears unchanged.
