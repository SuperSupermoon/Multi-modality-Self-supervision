New almost uniform opacification in the mid and lower left hemithorax is probably a combination of moderate pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse. There is a large irregular radiopacity projecting over the right upper lobe, from the mediastinum to the lateral chest wall, much of which is artifact from external connectors. Nevertheless there may be new right upper lobe atelectasis or consolidated. I recommend repeat chest radiograph with careful attention to removing all external devices. ET tube is in standard position, given the severe flexion of the chin. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. Left subclavian line ends in the upper right atrium. Shunt catheter traverses the right neck chest and upper abdomen.
