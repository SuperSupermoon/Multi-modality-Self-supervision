Apparent slight enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in comparison to prior chest x-ray from ___ likely relates to lower lung volumes and AP technique. The cardiomediastinal contours are otherwise stable and within normal limits, with unchanged aortic arch calcifications. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
