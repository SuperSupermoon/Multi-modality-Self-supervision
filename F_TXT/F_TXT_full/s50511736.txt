There is persistent interstitial prominence consistent with mild pulmonary edema. This is not significantly changed from prior radiograph. There is a new opacity at the right base which is asymmetric in comparison to the left. It is most likely due to aspiration or infection. Less likely, it could represent asymmetric edema. There is no definite pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and normal. A TIPS catheter is noted in the right upper quadrant.
