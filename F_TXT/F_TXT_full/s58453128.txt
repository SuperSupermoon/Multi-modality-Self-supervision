As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new left PICC line. The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the mid to lower SVC. No complication, notably no pneumothorax. At the left lung bases, in part in the retrocardiac lung areas, a new parenchymal opacity is noted. The opacity shows air bronchograms and is ill-defined. In the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia must be suspected. No pleural effusions. New drain in the right upper quadrant.
