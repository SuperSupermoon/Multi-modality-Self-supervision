As compared to the previous radiograph, the transparency of the lung parenchyma has increased, predominantly due to the decrease in severity of the pre-existing pulmonary edema. Bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely a combination of effusions and atelectasis, persist. Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Small intrafissural component of the right pleural effusion.
