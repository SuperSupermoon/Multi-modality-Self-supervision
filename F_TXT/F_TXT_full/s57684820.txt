There are multiple bilateral patchy opacities in the lung, the largest in the lateral left mid lung zone but also seen in the right greater than left bibasilar regions and possibly in the upper lobes as well. Differential diagnosis includes multifocal pneumonia versus neoplastic process, metastatic disease, particularly if patient has a known primary. Given history of trauma, pulmonary contusion cannot be excluded. Small left pleural effusion is seen. Difficult to exclude a trace right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. This is a partially imaged the proximal left humerus fracture.
