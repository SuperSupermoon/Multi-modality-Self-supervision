As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The patient has an unchanged endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right PICC line. There is unchanged complete homogeneous opacification of the left hemithorax, likely caused by a fluid collection, with mild shift of the mediastinum towards the right. The right lung remains unchanged in appearance.
