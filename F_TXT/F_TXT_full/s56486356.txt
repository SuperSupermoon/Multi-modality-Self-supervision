Frontal radiograph of the chest when compared to the prior studies demonstrates slight decrease in lung volumes with worsening opacification at the right middle and lower lung zonesas well as the left base, likely redistribution of pulmonary edema, although fluctuating atelectasis, suggestive of aspiration, may be entertained. Pulmonary vascular congestion persists and the cardiac contour is unchanged. Monitoring and support devices are stable. Pleural effusions are presumed but no pneumothorax.
