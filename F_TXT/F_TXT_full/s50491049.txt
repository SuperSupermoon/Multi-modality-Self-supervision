Within the limitations of technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably within normal limits. The lungs appear clear aside from minimal suspected right basilar atelectasis associated with a mildly elevated right hemidiaphragm. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No free air is identified.
