AP portable supine view of the chest. An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing 2.9 cm above the carina. As seen on same-day chest CT, there is cardiomegaly with perihilar opacities and prominence of the mediastinum. Scattered opacities within the lungs likely represent edema with small bilateral pleural effusions noted. No supine evidence for pneumothorax. The stomach is gas distended. No bony injuries are seen.
