A pigtail catheter is again seen overlying the right upper quadrant. Lung volumes are somewhat diminished and there is increasing opacity in the retrocardiac region with a suggestion of air bronchograms which either reflects partial lower lobe atelectasis or could be consistent with a developing pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature but no evidence of pulmonary edema. There is likely a small layering left effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning.
