In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been some decrease in the bilateral diffuse opacifications, though there is still a substantial residual especially on the right. This is again consistent with substantial volume loss in the right lower lobe and possible right middle lobe associated with pleural fluid. Central catheter is unchanged and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
