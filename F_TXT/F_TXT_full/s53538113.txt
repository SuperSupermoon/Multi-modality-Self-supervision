Endotracheal tube has been repositioned, with tip now terminating about 6.8 cm above the carina. This could be advanced approximately 2 cm for standard positioning. Side port of NG tube is proximal to the GE jucation. Again demonstrated is an apparent mass in the right juxtahilar region, with localized collapse of the superior segment right lower lobe. This raises the concern for a neoplastic process such as carcinoid or lymphoma and less likely an aggressive infection in this patient with history of HIV infection. New patchy left lower lobe opacity may be due to patchy atelectasis or aspiration. The recommendation for further imaging of the apparent right hilar mass has been discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on ___ at 7:22 a.m.
