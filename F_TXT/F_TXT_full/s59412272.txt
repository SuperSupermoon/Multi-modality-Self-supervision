The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Stable irregularity of the left costophrenic angle is unchanged and correlates with mild pleural thickening and scarring. Fullness in the right hilum is stable and represents superimposition of the pulmonary artery and veins. The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged. The mediastinal contours are normal.
