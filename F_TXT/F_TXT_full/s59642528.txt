In comparison with the study of ___, there are improved lung volumes. The monitoring and support devices remain in place. The right hemidiaphragm is poorly seen and there is hazy opacification at the base, consistent with layering pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. There is opacification at the left base that could well represent atelectasis, although in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. Prominence of central vessels suggests elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
