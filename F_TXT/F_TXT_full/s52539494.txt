The previously seen right IJ line has been removed. No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen is a left-sided single lead pacemaker (transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator) with lead over the right ventricle. Lordotic positioning. Again seen are low inspiratory volumes. Stable prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, with fixation hardware again noted -- this appearance is likely accentuated by AP technique, low volumes, lordotic positioning. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, overall similar to the prior study. Patchy right perihilar opacity is are also similar, possibly slightly more pronounced. Equivocal vascular engorgement. No gross effusion.
