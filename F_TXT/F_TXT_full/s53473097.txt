Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. There is mild pulmonary edema. More focal opacity in the left lung base could reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded. Probable trace bilateral pleural effusions are present. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen. Multiple clips are noted within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
