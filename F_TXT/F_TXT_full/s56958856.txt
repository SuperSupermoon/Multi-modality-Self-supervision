Single AP portable view of the chest. Compared to prior exams, there has been no significant interval change. The lungs are clear of confluent consolidation, large effusion, or pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration. Densemitral annular calcifications are again noted. Multiple posterior right rib fractures are again noted. Known compression deformities in the thoracic spine are not well seen on this portable view.
