In comparison with the study ___, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the upper stomach. The side port is in the region of the esophagogastric junction, and the tube should be pushed forward 5-10 cm if possible. Endotracheal tube remains at the clavicular level with the tip approximately 4.7 cm above the carina. There is increasing opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and small pleural effusion. The right lung is clear and there is no vascular congestion.
