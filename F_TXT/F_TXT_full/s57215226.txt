Patient has had median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is exaggerated by lower lung volumes, although probably stable since ___, but there is mild engorgement of the mediastinal veins suggesting increased intravascular volume or pressure. Previous cephalization of blood flow in the lungs has improved. Consolidation at the base of the right lung which was new on ___ is unchanged either pneumonia or atelectasis. There is no edema or appreciable pleural effusion. ET tube is in standard placement but there is some suggestion of narrowing of the mid trachea which should be evaluated with conventional radiographs when feasible. Esophageal drainage tube ends in the upper stomach but should be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. No pneumothorax.
