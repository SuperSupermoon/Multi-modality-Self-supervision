1. Interval placement of a right basilar pleural catheter with no evidence of pneumothorax. Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. There is a persistent patchy opacity of the right mid and lower thorax, which has somewhat decreased, suggesting decreasing pleural effusion. Persistent fullness to both hilar areas most likely is vascular in etiology rather than representing lymphadenopathy when correlated with a CT of ___. The medial right lung mass on CT of ___ is not easily appreciated given the presence of the overlying effusion, but likely obscures the right heart border. Overall, cardiac size is stable. There is streaky and patchy opacity again seen at the left base, which is slightly more prominent on the current study, raising concern for aspiration or patchy atelectasis. Clinical correlation is advised. The left lung appears hyperinflated, suggestive of underlying emphysema. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
