In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. Fibrous stranding with apical pleural thickening is again seen on the right. Cardiac silhouette is essentially within normal limits. Vague suggestion of some interstitial lines at the bases could be a manifestation of mild interstitial edema. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle could reflect pleural fluid or thickening. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
