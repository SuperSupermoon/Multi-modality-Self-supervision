The left PICC has been removed. There are low lung volumes. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is mildly enlarged. A moderate size hiatal hernia is redemonstrated. Patchy opacities at lung bases are likely representative of atelectasis, though aspiration is difficult to exclude. Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Fullness of the superior mediastinum is compatible with tortuous vessels as noted on the chest CT from ___. Scarring within the lung apices with associated bronchiectasis is unchanged. Trace bilateral pleural effusions may be present. There is no pneumothorax.
