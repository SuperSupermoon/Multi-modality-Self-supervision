In comparison with study of ___, there has been a decrease in the degree of left apical pneumothorax. Left basilar opacification persists, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and some pleural effusion. Hazy opacification at the right base is consistent with some fluid on this side as well with mild atelectatic changes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is essentially unchanged. The diameter of the tracheostomy again is less than half that of the native trachea.
