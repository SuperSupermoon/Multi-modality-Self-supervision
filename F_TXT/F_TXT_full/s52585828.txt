ET tube present, at the level of lower clavicular heads, 7 cm below the carina. NG tube present, extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. The mean pulmonary artery and hila both . prominent, similar to the prior film. Again seen is increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is diffuse vascular plethora, thickening of the minor fissure and peribronchial cuffing. Hazy opacity at both lung bases could reflect atelectasis and/or small amount of layering pleural fluid. Compared with the prior film and allowing for technical differences, the overall appearance is similar.
