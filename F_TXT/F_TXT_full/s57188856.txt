Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study from the same day earlier. After placement of the right chest tube, there is substantial expansion of the lung with minimal apical pneumothorax present. Bilateral elevation of the diaphragm is noted and small pleural effusion is most likely present on the right.
