In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Little if any elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Left basilar opacification suggests volume loss in the lower lobe with pleural fluid, which could be related to splinting following rib fractures. No evidence of pneumothorax. Left subclavian catheter again extends to the lower SVC.
