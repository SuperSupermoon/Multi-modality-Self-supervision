There is moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly. The aortic arch has a diameter of approximately 4.7 cm and is, thus, slightly enlarged. Also enlarged is the contour of the ascending aorta. These changes are consistent with the known aortic dissection, documented on the CT examination from ___. There could be mild fluid overload, but no overt pulmonary edema is present. Minimal atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung region and at the right lung bases. No pleural effusions. No apical cap, no pneumothorax.
