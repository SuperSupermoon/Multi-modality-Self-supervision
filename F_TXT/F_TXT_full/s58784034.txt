Given the deflection of the neck and mandible, tip of the endotracheal tube 3 cm from the carina is appropriate. Lung volumes are substantially lower today, exaggerating new mild cardiac enlargement. New heterogeneous opacification in both lower lungs could be developing pneumonia, recent severe aspiration, or dependent edema, exaggerated by dependent atelectasis. Pleural effusion is small if any. No pneumothorax.
