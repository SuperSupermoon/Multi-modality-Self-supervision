Bilateral airspace abnormalities, right worse than left, are persistent, but improving. A small left and small right pleural effusion are present. A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in appropriate position. A NG tube is seen coursing into the stomach and off the view of the film. A left-sided dialysis line terminates in the superior SVC. A left-sided pigtail chest tube is in unchanged position as is a right-sided drain with the tip projecting in the region of the right mediastinum. Widening of the mediastinum is a persistent abnormality, but decreasing since the immediate postoperative films. Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. Large right perihilar calcified lymph nodes are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
