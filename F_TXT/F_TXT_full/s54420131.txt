Again seen is cardiomegaly, with right greater left bibasilar opacity likely reflecting bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation right-greater-than-left layering effusions. The appearance is similar to the film from 1 day earlier. There is also CHF, with vascular plethora and vascular blurring. Compared to the prior film, there may have been very slight improvement in the degree of upper zone redistribution/vascular plethora. Tubing overlying the cardiac silhouette could represent a pericardial drain, best correlated clinically. Again seen is a left IJ central line with tip over mid/ distal SVC and a right-sided PICC line, with tip near the cavoatrial junction.
