AP portable semi upright view of the chest. Diffusely increased interstitial opacities are seen within the lungs which could reflect edema. The left lower lobe is poorly assessed due to underpenetration. No large effusions or pneumothorax is seen. The overall cardiomediastinal silhouette is notable for mild cardiomegaly. The bony structures appear intact.
