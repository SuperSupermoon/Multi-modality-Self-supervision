As compared to the previous radiograph from ___, 9:55 p.m., there is unchanged evidence of a miniscule right-sided pneumothorax. In the interval, this pneumothorax has slightly decreased in extent. The position of the monitoring and support devices, including the pigtail catheter in the right pleural space, is unchanged. Unchanged severity in extent of the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities. Stable normal size of the cardiac silhouette. The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded, given that the left costophrenic sinus is blunted.
