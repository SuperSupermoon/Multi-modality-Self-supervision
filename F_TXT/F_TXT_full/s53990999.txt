Lung volumes are low. Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Streaky opacities in the lung bases are compatible with areas of atelectasis.

A TIPS catheter is seen within the right upper abdomen as well as biliary stents. Embolization material is seen within the left upper abdomen. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
