An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 2.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm. A right IJ central line is present, tip over distal SVC. There is probably some left-sided volume loss, with slight leftward shift of mediastinum. There is increased retrocardiac density, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. There is also increased opacity at the right lung base with partial obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm. Probable right and ? left effusion. There is upper zone redistribution, with vascular blurring. Old healed left-sided rib fractures incidentally noted. Compared with ___ and allowing for differences in positioning and technique, the degree of opacification at the left and right bases appears slightly worse. There are probable effusions, which are difficult to delineate and may contribute to this opacification.
