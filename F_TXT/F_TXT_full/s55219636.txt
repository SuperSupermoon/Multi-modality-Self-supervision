Tracheostomy tube is again seen. There has been interval placement of a right-sided subclavian central venous catheter, with the tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction. There is a dual chamber cardiac pacemaker present, with leads as expected in position. Allowing for the lung volumes, the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are probably within normal limits. The left hemithorax appears unchanged since the prior examination, with disproportionate of volume loss of the left hemithorax compared with right, as well as retrocardiac opacity. No osseous abnormalities are appreciated on this limited radiograph.
