In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes which accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. There is opacification involving the mid and lower zones on the right. Some of this could reflect a pleural fluid and areas of atelectasis, though the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. On the left, there is retrocardiac opacification with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural fluid.
