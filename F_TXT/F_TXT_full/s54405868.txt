As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube was removed. The other monitoring and support devices, including the cardio vascular assistance device and the left chest tube are in unchanged position. There might be minimal increase of a left pleural effusion, with subsequent areas of atelectasis at the basal and basal lateral left lung. No change in appearance of the right lung and of the cardiac silhouette.
