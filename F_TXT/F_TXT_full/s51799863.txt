As compared to the previous radiograph, the distribution of the pre-existing pleural effusions has slightly changed, with minimally more effusion on the left on today's images compared to yesterday. On the right, the effusion has slightly decreased. Moderate cardiomegaly with signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema persists. The monitoring and support devices are constant. No new parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax. The right PICC line continues to be located in too proximal location.
