Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. There is a left basal pigtail catheter. There has been interval decrease in size of left pleural effusion. Previously seen large air collection in the left lower mid hemithorax is no longer visualized. ET tube is seen in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. The right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. There has been interval increase in right lower lobe atelectasis and small right pleural effusion. Left perihilar and left lower lobe atelectasis are again noted.
