The patient carries a right-sided chest tube. The tube is in correct position. There is no evidence of right apical pneumothorax. However, a small post-procedural pneumothorax could be present at the level of the right costophrenic sinus. There is no evidence of tension. An opacity in the upper regions of the left hemithorax is strongly suggestive of left upper lobe atelectasis. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions. No pneumonia.
