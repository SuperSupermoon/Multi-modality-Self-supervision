AP chest compared to ___: Severe cardiomegaly is stable. Lung volumes are lower, making it difficult to exclude very mild interstitial edema. There are no areas of likely pneumonia, and pleural effusions are small if any. Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead unchanged. Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified, very tortuous and probably mildly dilated inferiorly.
