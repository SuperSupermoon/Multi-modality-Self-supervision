As compared to the previous radiograph, patient has been extubated, the nasogastric tube has been removed, and the lung volumes have slightly increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. A plate-like atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung areas and a right middle lobe opacity that pre-existed persist. Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unremarkable. Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions.
