Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina with the neck in a flexed position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Persistent left retrocardiac opacity, likely a combination of pneumonic consolidation and adjacent small pleural effusion as demonstrated on recent CT of two days earlier. Additional patchy opacities in the right infrahilar region likely correspond to additional sites of peribronchiolar consolidation on the recent chest CT. No definite new areas of consolidation are present within the lungs, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
