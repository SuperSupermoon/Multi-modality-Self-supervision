Endotracheal tube ends 5.7 cm above the carina. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Moderate pulmonary edema is similar on the right but increased on the left, now more symmetric. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial. No pneumothorax. Vascular stents in the right brachiocephalic and SVC are again seen. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Increased osseous density is likely related to renal osteodystrophy.
