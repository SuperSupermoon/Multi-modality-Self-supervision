Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to CT chest obtained the same day earlier. The ET tube tip is 4.6 cm above the carina. The soft tissue swelling in the left chest wall is demonstrated consistent with the necrotizing fascitis. Bibasal opacities are noted, most likely reflecting areas of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
