A single frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is unchanged, allowing for differences in lung volumes. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema is seen. The right hilum is slightly dense, which may be due to lung volumes. Median sternotomy wires are intact.
