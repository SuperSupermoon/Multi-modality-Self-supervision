Interval decrease in size of layering left effusion status post thoracentesis with no evidence of pneumothorax. Right Port-A-Cath unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Persistent faint bibasilar opacities likely reflect patchy atelectasis in the setting of small effusions. Left upper lobe opacity is unchanged and consistent with radiation change when correlated with recent chest CT and the patient's clinical history. No pulmonary edema.
