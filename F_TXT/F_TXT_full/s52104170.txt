Frontal semi-upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates lower lung volumes than were demonstrated on the prior study. There is moderate engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature, with note of septal thickening. The azygos has become engorged in the interim, and there is moderate cardiomegaly. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Note is made of an azygous fissure. There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
