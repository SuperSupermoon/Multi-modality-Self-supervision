In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. Low lung volumes may account for the increased prominence of pulmonary vessels, though there probably is some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. There is increased opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm. This is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable pleural effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to also be considered.
