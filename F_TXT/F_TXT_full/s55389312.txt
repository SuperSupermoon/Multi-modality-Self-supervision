The patient is intubated with the ET tube tip being 6.8 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC. The NG tube passes below the diaphragm most likely terminating in the stomach. As compared to prior studies, there is interval improvement in the bilateral upper and mid lung zone consolidations but unchanged bibasal consolidations, more asymmetric that might potentially reflect residua of the gradually resolving process. The appearance of the current radiograph represents more nodular than diffuse and homogeneous pattern that in addition to pulmonary edema, other etiologies should be considered such as extensive involvement of the lungs by exogenous substance, parenchymal hemorrhage or massive aspiration (less likely). Please correlate it with bronchoalveolar lavage if clinically appropriate.
