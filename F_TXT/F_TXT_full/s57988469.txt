Left-sided central venous line is again seen similar in position, terminating in the low SVC. Again seen is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and blunting of the right costophrenic angle which could be due to a trace right pleural effusion. There is overlying right basilar atelectasis. Minor left basilar atelectasis is also seen. No new focal consolidation is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. The aortic knob is calcified. Spinal surgical hardware is noted.
