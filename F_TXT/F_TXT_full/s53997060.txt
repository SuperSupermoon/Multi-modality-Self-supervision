Tip of left PICC terminates within the left axilla, and a tracheostomy tube remains in place terminating at the thoracic inlet level, with tip apparently abutting the right lateral wall of the trachea. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable in size. Interval improved aeration at both lung bases. No new areas of consolidation in the lungs to suggest a new focus of pneumonia. Left pleural effusion has decreased in size with small residual effusion remaining.
