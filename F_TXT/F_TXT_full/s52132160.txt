Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably enlarged. There is a small right basilar and lateral pleural effusion. The overall interstitium is somewhat prominent, particularly in the right mid and lower lung, but this does not appear to be significantly changed since ___. Given that the left lung appears grossly clear, this more likely represents an infectious process rather than edema. Clinical correlation, however, is advised. No pneumothorax.
