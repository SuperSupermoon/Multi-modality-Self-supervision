There is minimal left basilar atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear without evidence of a pneumonia or pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal, and unchanged from the prior CT. There is equivocal intraperitoneal air layering below the left hemidiaphragm, though this may be gastric gas. The bowel gas pattern is nonspecific.
