Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is an endotracheal tube, right IJ central line and left subclavian central catheter, which are unchanged in position and appropriately sited. There is enteric tube whose side port is at the GE junction and could be advanced several centimeters for more optimal placement. The heart size is within normal limits. There are again seen airspace opacities throughout both lung fields, more confluent within the left chest. There is a left-sided chest tube with distal lead tip in the left lung apex. Overall, findings are stable.
