AP chest compared to ___: Still intubated, lung volumes have increased. Heterogeneous opacification throughout both lungs suggests widespread pneumonia, possibly cavitary. No doubt chronic changes of organzing ARDS are contributory. The heart is normal size, and there is no mediastinal distention to suggest either volume overload or cardiac decompensation. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. ET tube is in standard placement. No pneumothorax.
