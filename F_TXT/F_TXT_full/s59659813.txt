Comparison is made to prior study, ___. Moderate pulmonary edema has minimally increased. Increasing opacities in the right perihilar region and right lower lobe could be asymmetric edema but aspiration cannot be excluded; attention in followup is recommended. Small right effusion has increased. Small left effusion is stable. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. There are low lung volumes. Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC. Tracheostomy is in standard position.
