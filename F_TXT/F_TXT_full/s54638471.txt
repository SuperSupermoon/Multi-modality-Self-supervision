Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are slightly low lung volumes, accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Patchy right lung base opacity may represent confluence of overlapping structures, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting and could be better evaluated with dedicated PA and lateral views. The left lung is clear. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. The aorta remains tortuous.
