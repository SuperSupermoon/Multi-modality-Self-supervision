Overall improvement in degree of atelectasis in the left lung, with residual left lower lobe collapse and adjacent moderate left effusion. Abrupt cutoff of left bronchus and rapidity of development favor an acute mucus plugging as the cause of collapse. Right lung is clear, and note is made of a small left pleural effusion.
