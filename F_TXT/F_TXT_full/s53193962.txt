The patient has been intubated. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube has been passed and terminates perhaps shortly beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Findings associated with pulmonary edema appear not substantially changed. Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.
