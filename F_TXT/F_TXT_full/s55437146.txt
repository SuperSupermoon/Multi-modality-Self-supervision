A single portable AP radiograph was obtained. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated. Retrocardiac opacity obscures the medial left hemidiaphragm. In addition there is an ill defined opacity along the lateral left lung base. There is no pneumothorax. There may be a small right pleural effusion. Cardiomegaly is moderate.
