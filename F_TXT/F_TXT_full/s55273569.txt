The initial radiograph from ___ shows interval placement of an endotracheal tube whose tip terminates above the clavicles. Advancement by 1-2 cm would provide more effective ventilation. There is also new right upper lobe atelectasis with associated volume loss. The left lung is clear. The heart and mediastinum are magnified by the projection. A nasogastric tube coils in the stomach, distal tip not visualized. The follow-up radiograph from ___ shows slight advancement of the endotracheal tube. The right upper lobe has re-expanded, but lung volumes remain low. There are new bilateral airspace opacities which are most likely due to pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also new. Increased retrocardiac opacification is most likely due to atelectasis. Heart size has increased.
