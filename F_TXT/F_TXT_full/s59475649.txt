Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Engorged pulmonary vasculature and mediastinal veins is suggestive of volume overload versus cardiac decompensation. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Right pectoral Port-A-Cath ends at the origin of the SVC. No pneumothorax.
