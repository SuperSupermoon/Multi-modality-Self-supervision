Assessment of the lung bases is limited as this area was not completely included in the exam. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.5 cm from the carina. Enteric tube courses within the region of the esophagus, though the distal aspect is not well visualized. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip is in the low SVC. Heart size is normal. Aortic knob is calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Hazy opacities within the lung bases likely reflect layering pleural effusions, small to moderate in size. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
