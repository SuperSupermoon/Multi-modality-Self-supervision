Single semi-erect AP portable view is provided. Again there are bibasilar consolidations and pleural effusions with mild pulmonary edema, but improved opacities particularly in the right lower lobe. The opacities in the left midlung are new. These findings are consistent with with redistribution of edema, although the new opacity in the left midlung could represent a focal infectious process versus fluid in the fissure. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. A left-sided internal jugular line terminates in the right atrium unchanged from prior studies. Above the tracheotomy, there is narrowing of the airway which could be due to diffuse edema of larynx.
