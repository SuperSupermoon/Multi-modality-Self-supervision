New right internal jugular vascular sheath terminates in the right brachiocephalic vein just below the right medial clavicle. There is no visible pneumothorax. Lung volumes are lower than on the prior study, with resultant accentuation of cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Patchy bibasilar opacities have developed, more prominent in the left lower lobe than the right. Given the rapid development, this may be due to either aspiration or atelectasis.
