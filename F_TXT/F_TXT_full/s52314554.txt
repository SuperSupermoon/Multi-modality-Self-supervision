Portable AP upright chest radiograph shows stable to slight slight decrease in the cardiac size and no central pulmonary vascular congestion compared to the most recent previous studies. Haziness in the right costophrenic angle laterally is slightly decreased and may represent some chronic pleural fluid versus pleural diaphragmatic adhesions. Note is made of a sharper curve to the patient's Port-A-Cath tubing where it extends from the expected region of the left innominate vein into the superior vena cava. A lateral view with follow may be helpful tissue to assure this is in unchanged position.
