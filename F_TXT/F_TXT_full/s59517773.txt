Status post right upper lobe mass removed via lobectomy. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is likely secondary to volume loss and is stable over multiple prior studies. Opacity at the right hilum is likely due to atelectasis. Otherwise, the lungs are clear without focal opacities, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. The air in the soft tissues overlying the right chest is likely related to a prior chest tube.
