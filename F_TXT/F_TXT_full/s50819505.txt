The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively stable. There is mild pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may be a reflection of dependent pulmonary edema, though atelectasis is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
