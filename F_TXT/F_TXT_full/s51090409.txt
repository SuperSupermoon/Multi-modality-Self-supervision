A frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a new moderately-sized left apical pneumothorax and the new left pleural fluid. Left lower lobe atelectasis is again seen. The right lung remains clear. There is no right pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size remains normal. Left lateral rib fractures are redemonstrated. Vertebral body fractures are better evaluated on recent CT.
