Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and is accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion and a small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. By report, the patient has known rib fractures. These are not well demonstrated on this portable chest radiograph which was not designed for assessing the ribs. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. Surgical clips are present in the mid abdomen.
