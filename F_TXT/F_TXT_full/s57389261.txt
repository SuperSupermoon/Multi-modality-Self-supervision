Perihilar distribution of opacities consistent with pulmonary edema. Opacities somewhat obscure mediastinal and hilar contours, though there are no gross contour abnormalities evident. Bilateral large pleural effusions with dense opacification in the lung bases likely reflecting adjacent compressive atelectasis, though cannot exclude pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Minimally displaced rib fractures evident in the right posterior sixth and seventh ribs as well as possible non-displaced fractures in the eighth and ninth ribs. Rib fractures were better evaluated on concurrent CT. The patient is status post CABG with sternotomy sutures midline and intact. There is dense mitral annular calcification identified as well as aortic valve replacement. Pacemaker leads tips are positioned in the right atrium and right ventricle.
