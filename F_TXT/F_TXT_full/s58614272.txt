In comparison with the study of ___, the position of the endotracheal tube is quite similar, with the tip at the clavicular level, approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. Left chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the left base most likely represents atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Nasogastric tube extends to the upper stomach. The side hole is not well seen, and could well be above the hemidiaphragm.
