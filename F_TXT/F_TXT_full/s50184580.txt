AP chest compared to ___: Mild peribronchial opacification in the right lower lung could represent pneumonia, but I suspect this is mild pulmonary edema or hemorrhage. Findings have not changed appreciably since ___ on the right. There is greater involvement in the left lower lobe today than previously. Heart size is normal, though increased since ___, no other reason to suspect mild edema. Right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
