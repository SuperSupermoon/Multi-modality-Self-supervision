Right-sided chest tube is noted and slightly pulled back in comparison to the prior study. Right-sided pneumothorax is again noted at the superior and inferiolateral portions of the right lung. Again noted is massive air collection in the soft tissues causing multiple horizontal lines which overlie the entire thorax. Previously noted pneumomediastinum appears stable. There is no change in the appearance of the left lung parenchyma. Multiple bilateral rib fractures are noted.
