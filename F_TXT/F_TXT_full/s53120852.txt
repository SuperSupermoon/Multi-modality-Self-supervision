AP chest compared to ___: Compared for example to ___, there has been a substantial increase in pulmonary vascular caliber, new small bilateral pleural effusions and suggestion of mild edema all pointing toward biventricular cardiac decompensation. In addition, there is greater irregular opacification in the right lung apex and whether this is asymmetric edema or early pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements. No pneumothorax.
