AP view of the chest provided. Compared to prior study, the degree of diffuse interstitial opacity is largely unchanged. However, more confluent opacity in the left lung base is seen, which could suggest atelectasis versus developing pneumonia. No large pleural effusions are seen. Chronic dislocation of the right shoulder is again noted.
