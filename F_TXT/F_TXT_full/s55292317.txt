Moderate left pleural effusion is much larger today. Small right pleural effusion is larger and there is more opacification of the bases of both lungs, clearly atelectasis on the left, conceivably atelectasis, pneumonia, or a combination of both, on the right. Multiple right rib fractures are no more distracted today than 4 days ago. Heart size is obscured by left pleural abnormality, but probably no larger. Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified, but caliber cannot be assessed. Tip of the tracheostomy tube abuts left tracheal wall and it should be evaluated clinically to see if it is appropriately positioned in supported. Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
