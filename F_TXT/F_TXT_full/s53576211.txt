Left apical pneumothorax is stable to minimally increased in size from ___ 33. Unilateral left-sided pleural thickening is potentially posttraumatic in the setting of adjacent rib deformities, but comparison to older radiographs would be helpful to ensure stability and to exclude a malignant pleural process such mesothelioma or metastatic adenocarcinoma. A bandlike opacity in the left juxta hilar region may also be assessed for retrospective stability at that time.
