There is some overlying motion artifact which limits the examination. A right basilar chest tube remains in place. There is air within the right lateral chest wall and neck soft tissues consistent with subcutaneous emphysema. Rounded lucency at the right apex likely represents a small pneumothorax. There is bilateral parenchymal distortion with fibrotic changes at the bases consistent with fibrotic lung disease. Multiple small nodular opacities with associated right apical pleural thickening are again seen and may reflect prior granulomatous infection. Clinical correlation is advised. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
