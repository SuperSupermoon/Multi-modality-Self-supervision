Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Moderate right pleural effusion has increased with increasing adjacent atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Left lower lobe opacities are a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, increased from prior. Right lower lobe opacities have increased consistent with increasing amount of pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Diffuse opacities in the right perihilar region and right upper lobe are grossly unchanged, as mentioned before this could be due to aspiration. Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
