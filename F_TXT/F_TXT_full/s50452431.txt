As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously placed left PICC line has been removed and the new right PICC line was inserted. The tip of the line projects over the mid to low SVC. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The lung volumes have decreased. There are small pleural effusions bilaterally, limited to the costophrenic sinuses, as well as subsequent areas of atelectasis. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Minimal fluid overload.
