In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the endotracheal tube has been removed and replaced with a tracheostomy tube, which appears well positioned with no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. The left hemidiaphragm is not well seen, consistent with some volume loss and fluid at the left base. There are now bilateral chest tubes with no evidence of pneumothorax. The right hemidiaphragm is indistinct, suggesting some small pleural effusion and atelectasis on this side as well.
