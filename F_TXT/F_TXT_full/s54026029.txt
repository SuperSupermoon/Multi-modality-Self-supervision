Spinal hardware overlies the upper and mid thoracic spine in this patient with a history of thoracic spine osteomyelitis. Interval extubation. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC, unchanged. Lung volumes remain relatively low with streaky linear opacities at both bases, right greater than left, which may represent subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. Possible small right effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal limits and unchanged given differences in positioning between studies. No definite focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. However, if the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging should be considered.
