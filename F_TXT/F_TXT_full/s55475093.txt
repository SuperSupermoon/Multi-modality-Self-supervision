Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and accompanied by upper zone vascular re-distribution, perihilar haziness and bilateral interstitial opacities. Additionally, more confluent asymmetrical opacities have developed at both lung bases, right greater than left. Small right pleural effusion is new. Observed findings could be due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema with or without co-existing basilar pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
