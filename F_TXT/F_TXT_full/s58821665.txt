Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position. The bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities with more confluent consolidation in the left upper lobe and at the right base do not appear to be significantly changed. There is some prominence of the interstitium peripherally in the right lung but this also does not appear to be changed. No large effusions and no pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given marked patient rotation to the left.
