There is a right-sided pleural thickening compatible with history of pleurodesis, and a chest tube is noted along the right lung base. No definite pneumothorax is seen. A right upper lobe pulmonary nodule is noted, and the other previously noted right pleural mass and bilateral pulmonary nodules are better delineated on the recent chest CT. The heart is top-normal in size given AP technique. There is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax or overt pulmonary edema.
