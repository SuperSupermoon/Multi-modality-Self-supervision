Left chest tubes and a right pigtail pleural catheter remain in place. Prominent hyperlucencies are again demonstrated at the lung bases overlying the upper quadrants of the abdomen, and suggestive of at least moderate-sized basilar pneumothoraces. Visceral pleural lines are documented laterally in both lungs confirming the presence of pneumothoraces. As discussed with Dr. ___ by telephone at 8:45 a.m. on ___ at time of discovery, CT or decubitus radiographs could be obtained to better quantify the size of the pneumothoraces if warranted clinically. There has been slight improvement in the extent of subcutaneous emphysema, and previously reported pneumomediastinum is less apparent. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Appearance of the lungs is not appreciably changed since the recent study of one day earlier.
