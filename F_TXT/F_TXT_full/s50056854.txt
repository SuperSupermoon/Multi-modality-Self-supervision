1. Left-sided subclavian Port-A-Cath continues to have its tip in the distal SVC, near the cavoatrial junction. Heart remains enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is persistent minimal blunting the left costophrenic angle, which may represent a tiny effusion or chronic pleural thickening. Streaky linear opacities at the left base may reflect areas of atelectasis or scarring. No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Linear density overlying the left upper quadrant is likely external to the patient, but clinical correlation would be recommended.
