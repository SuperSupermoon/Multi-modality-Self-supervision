1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC. The median sternotomy with overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. Opacity along the right heart border and in the retrocardiac region likely representing known large hiatal hernia. There are several coronary stents in place. Lungs appear somewhat hyperinflated suggesting underlying emphysema. There are likely small bilateral effusions, left greater than right, with patchy retrocardiac opacity which could reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. Streaky linear opacities in the right upper lung most likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Prominent arterial calcification in the aorta as well as the splenic artery consistent with atherosclerosis. Degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint. No acute bony abnormality.
