Single AP semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No evidence of free air is seen beneath the hemidiaphragms although please note that the exam is semi-erect. If clinical concern for free air persists, consider re-attempt at a true erect view if patient able.
