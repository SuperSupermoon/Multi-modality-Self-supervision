In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends into the stomach with the side hole probably just distal to the esophagogastric junction. Allowing for differences in projection from the PA to AP, there is probably little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs since the earlier study of this date.
