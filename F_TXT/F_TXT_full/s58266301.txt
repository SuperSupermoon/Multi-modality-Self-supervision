Left PICC appears to have been replaced compared to the prior study and its tip is now near the cavoatrial junction. Right internal jugular central venous catheter has been removed. Lung volumes are low and there are linear opacities bilaterally likely representing atelectasis. Heart size and mediastinal contour are unchanged considering the lower lung volumes. No suspicious bone findings.
