AP chest compared to ___: There has been no change since ___. Component of pulmonary edema has improved since ___, but there is still substantial consolidation in both lower lungs, particularly the right where I suspect concurrent pneumonia. Substantial atelectasis is still present at the left base, and there is sufficient vascular congestion to argue for cardiac decompensation. Small pleural effusions persist. No pneumothorax. ET tube tip above the upper margin of the clavicles is no less than 5 cm from the carina and should be advanced 2 cm for more secured seating. A left PIC line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
