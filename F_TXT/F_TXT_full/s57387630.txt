In comparison with these earlier study of this date, there is again extensive subcutaneous emphysema extending from at least the upper portion of the abdomen to the lower neck on the right. Superimposed gas overlying the right hemithorax makes it difficult to assess for pneumothorax, though no significant pneumothorax is appreciated. The left lung is essentially clear. There are low lung volumes.
