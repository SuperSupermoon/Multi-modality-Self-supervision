Recently placed endotracheal tube terminates in the right main bronchus about 2 cm below the carina, as communicated by telephone with Dr. ___ at 4 p.m. on ___ at the time of discovery. Nasogastric tube terminates in the body of the stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance, but there has been interval worsening of pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by apparent asymmetrical pattern of pulmonary edema affecting the left lung to a greater degree than the right. Moderate right pleural effusion is similar to the prior study, but a moderate left pleural effusion has increased in size with adjacent atelectasis or consolidation in the left lower lobe.
