A midline nasogastric tube is seen with the opaque portion straddling the gastroesophageal junction, with the tip in the stomach. There has been interval removal of a right PICC line. Otherwise, compared to the prior radiograph, the cardiac silhouette is unchanged and the lung fields are clear although slightly lower in volume, which accentuates the pulmonary vasculature which is otherwise normal. No areas of consolidation are seen.
