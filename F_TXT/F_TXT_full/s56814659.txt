Single upright portable view of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a right pigtail pleural catheter, directed toward the upper mediastinum on the right, with subsequent reexpansion of the right lung, with only a small right apical pneumothorax remaining. The left lung is clear. There is no pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable, with no evidence of tension or mediastinal shift. No subdiaphragmatic free air is detected.
