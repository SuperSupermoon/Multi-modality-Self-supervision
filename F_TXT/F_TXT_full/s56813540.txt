Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size and accompanied by pulmonary vascular engorgement and slight perivascular indistinctness. Subtle basilar predominant interstitial opacities are visible in the right lung base and may reflect interstitial edema. Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are again demonstrated with adjacent basilar opacities which may reflect atelectasis and/or consolidation. This has slightly improved at the right base and is unchanged on the left.
