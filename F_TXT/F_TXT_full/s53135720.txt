Compared with the prior film, the right-sided chest tube has been removed. No pneumothorax is detected. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle could reflect a small right effusion, more pronounced than on the prior exam. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen are low inspiratory volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Dense alveolar infiltrates are suggested bilaterally, but are likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema that is again noted along the right chest wall.
