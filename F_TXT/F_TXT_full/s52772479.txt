1. Lines and tubes as described. Of note, there is an apparent left IJ line that does not cross to the right of the mediastinum. 2. Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette stable or slightly improved. 3. CHF findings have improved, but with residual interstitial edema, small left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and small left effusion. 4. The patient apparently has known pulmonary contusions, but what component of the findings is represented by contusion is difficult to distinguish by radiograph. 4. Left-sided rib fractures again noted. No pneumothorax detected.
