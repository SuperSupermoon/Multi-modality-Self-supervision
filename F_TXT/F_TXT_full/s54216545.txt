The tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. There continues to be bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities with more focal confluent area in the left upper lung. Overall, the aeration may have slightly improved in the left upper lung when compared to the most recent prior study. No pleural effusions. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given patient rotation.
