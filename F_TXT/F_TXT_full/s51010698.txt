There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which is low in position, coursing into the right main stem bronchus. Recommend withdrawal by 4-5 cm. A nasogastric tube is seen, distal aspect not appreciated and not clearly coursing below the level of the diaphragm. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Left base retrocardiac opacity is seen which could be due to aspiration/atelectasis given development in the interval. There may also be a small left pleural effusion.
