AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. During the interval, a left-sided chest tube has been placed through the lower chest wall and is seen to terminate just to the midline in supradiaphragmatic position. Previously identified massive pleural effusion has not changed significantly. There remains moderate shift of mediastinal structures towards the left side, indicative of volume loss. The right hemithorax does not show any significant pulmonary abnormality, nor is there evidence of a pneumothorax on the right side.
