ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Right basal chest tube is in place in unchanged position. There is no evident pneumothorax. Small-to-mild left pleural effusion is unchanged with unchanged adjacent atelectasis. Right lower lobe opacities have increased, could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Pulmonary edema has minimally increased. Subcutaneous emphysema has decreased. Increase in widened mediastinum could be just due to positioning or rotation, but attention should be paid in followup studies. There are persistent low lung volumes. Cardiomegaly is stable.
