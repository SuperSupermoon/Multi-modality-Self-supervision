AP chest compared to ___: Past spine radiograph suggests substantial bilateral pleural effusion and moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly unchanged. Given the obscuration by pleural effusion and soft tissue, little can be said about the lungs, except that most of the right lung and the left mid and upper lung are clear of consolidation. No pneumothorax. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements. Dual-channel left supraclavicular central venous line ends in the upper SVC and an enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
