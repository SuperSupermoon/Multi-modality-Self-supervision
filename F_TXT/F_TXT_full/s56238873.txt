The cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes again demonstrated compatible the patient's history of sarcoidosis. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky and linear opacities within the lingula and left lower lobe appear similar compared to the previous exam, and may reflect areas of scarring and/or atelectasis. Minimal patchy opacity within the right lung base could reflect infection or atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
