A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained. Lung volumes are mildly decreased. An opacity projecting over the right base has a sharp lateral border consistent with atelectasis. No additional focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is present. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. Incidental note is made of the splenic flexure appearing immediately under the left hemidiaphragm.
