The patient remains intubated, the endotracheal tube is now approximately 5 cm above the level the carina. A nasoenteric tube is incompletely visualized, the tip lies below the left diaphragm. Lung volumes are unchanged. There are diffuse bilateral hazy airspace opacities, slightly improved when compared to the prior study. As previously this could reflect pulmonary contusion, aspiration and/or atelectasis. No definite effusion seen but the left costophrenic angle is not visualized. No pneumothorax. No rib fracture seen.
