Since the recent study, the patient has been intubated with endotracheal tube tip terminating 4 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is in place, with tip terminating in the stomach, but side port may be above the GE junction level. There is otherwise no relevant short interval change since the recent chest x-ray performed a few hours earlier.
