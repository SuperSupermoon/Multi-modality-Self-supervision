As compared to the previous radiograph, the radiolucency of the lung parenchyma has increased, reflecting improved ventilation. There is no visible pneumothorax on the current image. The endotracheal tube and the feeding tube are in correct position. The left chest tube continues to be malpositioned, as mentioned in the previous report, with the side-hole in the chest wall. No pleural effusions.
