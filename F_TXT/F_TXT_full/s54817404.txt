In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and bibasilar atelectasis. Small pleural effusions probably are present bilaterally. In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of a basilar pneumonia would have to be considered. Upper lungs are clear and there is no vascular congestion.
