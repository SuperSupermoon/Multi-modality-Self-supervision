A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. The left heart border is not well seen, raising the possibility of lingular infection. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Prominent vascular markings may be due to pulmonary vascular congestion. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal allowing for low lung volumes.
