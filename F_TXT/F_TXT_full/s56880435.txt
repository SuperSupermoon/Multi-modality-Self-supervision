1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter, likely terminates in the extreme upper SVC. 2. Marked increase in the size of the right-sided pleural effusion since the prior study 4 hours earlier. 3. Chronic cardiomegaly, given the patient's young age, correlate with history of congenital heart disease. Evaluation with echocardiogram should be considered. This would also serve the function of ruling out pericardial effusion. 4. Given the bilateral pleural effusions, underlying infection cannot be ruled out, especially in the bases.
