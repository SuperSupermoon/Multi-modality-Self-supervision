AP chest compared to ___: Mild pulmonary edema has improved. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has worsened, perhaps a function of lower lung volumes.

No appreciable pleural effusion or interval mediastinal widening. Dr. ___ was paged at 8:50 a.m., 1 minute following recognition of the findings, and we discussed these findings by telephone at the time of dictation, two minutes later.
