In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with left ventricular configuration along with tortuosity of the aorta. Opacification at the right base most likely represents layering effusion and compressive atelectasis. The left costophrenic angle is sharp and no definite basilar atelectasis is appreciated on this side. Prominence of the superior mediastinum to the right again most likely represents tortuous brachiocephalic vessels.
