The initial radiograph from ___ hr shows acute worsening of extensive bilateral airspace opacities. The left subclavian central venous catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. Mild cardiac enlargement is unchanged. The followup radiograph from ___ hr shows improved airspace opacities following intubation. The new ET tube is slightly high-riding.
