Lungs remain hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema. Increasing opacity at the right lung base which would be concerning for aspiration or pneumonia, less likely atelectasis. Clinical correlation is advised. Linear opacities at the left base likely reflects scarring. No pulmonary edema. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours status post aortic valve replacement. Small right effusion. Interval removal of the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular ventricular pacing lead.
