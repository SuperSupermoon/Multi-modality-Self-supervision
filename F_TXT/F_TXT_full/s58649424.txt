As compared to the previous radiograph, there is now complete opacification of the right hemithorax, similar to the CT examination performed on ___. As documented on the CT examination, the cause for this changes a combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, and pleural effusion. There is minimal deviation of the mediastinal structures towards the right. Only a part of the known cavitary left lung lesions are seen on today's radiograph. No left pleural effusion.
