The lungs are reasonably well expanded with unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and mild vascular congestion. Mild interstitial edema may also be present, although similar to the prior study. A more multifocal opacity seen in the right base is poorly assessed. Consider repeat evaluation with PA and lateral views after patient is clinically able to delineate these findings further.
