CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___, pulmonary vascular plethora remains visible, in fact, the upper zones may be slightly more engorged. However, the degree of interstitial edema appears slightly less. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is patchy opacity at both bases with increased retrocardiac density. On the current image, the right heart border overlies the scoliotic spine, whereas on the prior film it projected to the right of the spine. While this could reflect some degree of left-sided volume loss, this difference may also be accentuated by differences in positioning, with left lordotic positioning on the current film.
