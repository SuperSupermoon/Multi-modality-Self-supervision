Since the prior chest x-ray, there has been removal of the left-sided PICC line. Lung volumes are low on the current study, causing bronchovascular crowding. Right basilar opacity, new since prior, may reflect atelectasis or underlying infection in the correct clinical setting. Streaky retrocardiac opacity may be atelectasis or scarring. No focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax.
