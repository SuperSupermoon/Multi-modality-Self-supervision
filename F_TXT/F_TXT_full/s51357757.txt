In comparison with study of ___, the right subclavian catheter extends to the right atrium. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are essentially unchanged. Continued low lung volumes with the cardiac silhouette mildly enlarged. The pulmonary vasculature appears to have improved with the lower lung vessels more sharply seen. Retrocardiac opacification again could reflect volume loss in the left lower lobe and there may be a small left effusion.
