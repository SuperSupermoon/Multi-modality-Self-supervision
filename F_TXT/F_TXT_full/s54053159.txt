Lung is moderately inflated with new ring shadow opacity at the right lung base that might be a large bronchiectatic saccule, especially in light of recent multifocal pneumonia. Further characterization of this area can be obtained with CXR in PA and lateral. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
