The heart is again mildly enlarged. The aortic arch is calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours, including a rounded expansile contour to the right upper mediastinum corresponding to a previously characterized thyroid goiter and tortuous great vessels, appears unchanged. The lungs appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Right-sided rib deformities are not well delineated but appear not significantly changed; these suggest several remote prior fractures.
