Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. A 9.5 cm diameter mass-like opacity in the periphery of the left upper lobe appears slightly less solid than on the prior study with greater heterogeneity. Additionally, there is improved aeration between the mass and the adjacent left hilar structures. Surrounding consolidation also appears slightly improved. Observed findings could be due to an improving infectious pneumonia, but co-existing neoplasm is of concern given marked narrowing of left upper lobe bronchus on prior CT torso of ___ and the rounded contour of this region of increased opacity. Left retrocardiac opacity is unchanged, but a small left pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size. Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened and is accompanied by increasing interstitial edema and a small right pleural effusion.
