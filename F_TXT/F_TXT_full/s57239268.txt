As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The lung volumes have slightly increased, as a consequence, the bilateral parenchymal opacities, at the right lung bases and in the left upper lobe appear slightly less dense but are still clearly present. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No pleural effusions. Mild pulmonary edema. The course of the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are unchanged.
