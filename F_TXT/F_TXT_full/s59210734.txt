As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the ECMO device, are in unchanged position. Minimal decrease in lung volumes, subsequent minimal increase in radiodensity of the entire lung parenchyma. The overall extent and severity of the changes, however, is constant. Constant appearance of the cardiac silhouette. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
