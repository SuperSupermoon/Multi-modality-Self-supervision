As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The lung volumes are low. There is no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax or larger pleural effusions. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. The pre described left upper lobe 1 cm pulmonary nodule is no longer clearly identified but might be obscured by the ECG cable.
