In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral layering, pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases. Extensive retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
