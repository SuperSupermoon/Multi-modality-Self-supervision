As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs indicative of pulmonary edema have markedly decreased. The size of the cardiac silhouette is normal. Minimal atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions has decreased. The monitoring and support devices are unchanged, except for a nasogastric tube that has been pulled back. The tip now projects over the gastroesophageal junction. The tube should be advanced by approximately 10 cm. No pneumothorax.
