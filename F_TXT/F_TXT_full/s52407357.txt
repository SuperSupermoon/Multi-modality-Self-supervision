Intra-aortic pump balloon still ends close to the apex of the aortic arch, approximately 3 cm above standard placement. Ascending Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the left pulmonary artery, unchanged. Given lower lung volumes, moderate pulmonary edema has probably not worsened, although mediastinal veins are probably more distended. Cardiac ___ are normal. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. No pneumothorax.
