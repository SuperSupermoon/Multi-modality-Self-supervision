There is relative opacification at the right lung apex compared to the left. The remainder of both lungs are well aerated without focal consolidation or pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is present. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The trachea is likely slightly deviated to the left in the upper mediastinum.
