In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Continued low lung volume accentuates the transverse diameter of the heart. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable small effusion.
