There are no prior chest radiographs available for review. Heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pulmonary edema. There is a venous suggestion of left pleural scarring, but no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Small nodule projecting over the anterior aspect of the right second rib could be sclerosis in the chest cage. Conventional radiograph should be obtained when feasible.
