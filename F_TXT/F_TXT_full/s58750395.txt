Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates ET tube, NG tube and right internal jugular central venous catheter in unchanged position. The pigtail catheter and left basilar chest tube are also unchanged. There is stable appearance of the left pleural opacity with poor aeration of the left lower lobe as well as the left lower lobe bronchus which may be obstructed. Lung volumes are lower with crowding of the bronchovascular markings which could just be related to low lung volumes versus mild edema. No large right pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
