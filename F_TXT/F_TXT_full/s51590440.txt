Comparison is made with prior study ___. Vascular congestion has improved. Aeration of the left lung has markedly improved. Bibasilar atelectasis largely on the left side have improved. Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged. New opacity in the left apex is consistent with a large area of atelectasis. NG tube tip is still high. The tip is in the stomach but the side port is above the GE junction, should be advanced for more standard position. Pneumoperitoneum is again noted. Subcutaneous emphysema has improved.
