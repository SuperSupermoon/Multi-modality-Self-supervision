Single portable view of the chest. Again, low lung volumes are seen. Increased interstitial markings on the current exam suggestive of vascular congestion. Left costophrenic angle is now more blunted potentially due to atelectasis, although effusion is also possible. Linear retrocardiac opacity persists. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is a new right IJ central venous catheter whose tip is in the right atrium and could be withdrawn 4.5 cm to be at the lower SVC. No visualized pneumothorax. Lower cervical fixation hardware is identified.
