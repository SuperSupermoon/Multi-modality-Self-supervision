No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits in size. Mildly engorged and indistinct pulmonary markings are consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Probable small bilateral effusions with basilar atelectatic changes. The tip of the endotracheal tube extends to the level of the cardioesophageal junction, where it crosses the lower margin of the image.
