There is near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax, with mild leftward shift of cardiomediastinal contours. Given known bronchial obstruction and narrowing on recent PET-CT, this is likely predominantly due to post-obstructive collapse and consolidation in the left lung, but an accompanying left pleural effusion is also likely. Right lung and pleural surfaces are grossly clear allowing for accentuation of bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes. Dr. ___ has been paged with these results at 8:30 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.
