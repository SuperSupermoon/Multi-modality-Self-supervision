Single AP view of the chest was reviewed. Since the most recent prior study, there has been placement of a right internal jugular line with tip terminating in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Additionally there is an placement of an enteric tube with tip in the stomach but sideholes near the GE junction. The heart is moderately enlarged. Interstitial edema is mild. Focal opacities at the lung bases, left greater than right, is likely combination of edema, small pleural effusion and atelectasis, but opacities in the left midlung zone and increasing in the right apex over the past two hours could be due to recent aspiration, pneumonia, or pulmonary hemorrhage.
