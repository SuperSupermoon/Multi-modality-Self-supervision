AP chest compared to ___: Supine positioning may explain interval increase in mediastinal caliber due to venous engorgement, particularly since the pulmonary vessels are distended and there is new mild pulmonary edema. Abdominal aortic CT on ___ showed no evidence of dissection in the imaged upper abdominal aorta, and therefore I doubt that dissection is responsible for any of the radiographic change, but there is no way for me to be sure looking at conventional radiographs alone. Mild cardiomegaly has increased. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements respectively. Pleural effusion is small if any. No pneumothorax.
