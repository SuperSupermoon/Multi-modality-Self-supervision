Slightly rotated positioning. As before, the lungs are hyperinflated, suggestive of COPD and there is moderate cardiomegaly with slight unfolding of the aorta. However, there is also new pulmonary vascular plethora, as well as patchy opacity at both bases and probable small bilateral effusions. Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is new. Findings are consistent with CHF. The possibility of bibasilar infiltrates cannot be excluded.
