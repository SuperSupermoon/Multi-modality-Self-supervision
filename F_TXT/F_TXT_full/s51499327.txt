The aorta is tortuous. The heart is within normal limits. There is enlargement of the left hilus, similar to the prior examination and consistent with long-standing calcific, granulomatous adenopathy. Extensive heterogeneity and opacity along the lateral right lung is unchanged and related to calcified pleural plaques. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is moderate soft tissue edema along the right chest wall.
