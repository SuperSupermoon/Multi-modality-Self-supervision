CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. As noted, two left chest tubes are in place. There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema, which does limit assessment for a subtle pneumothorax. No gross pneumothorax is identified. Some pneumomediastinal air is again seen, similar to prior. No large areas of atelectasis are seen. There is some patchy atelectasis at the left lung base. No gross effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is midline, within normal limits in contour. Compared with ___, appearance of the lungs and mediastinum and the two chest tubes appears stable.
