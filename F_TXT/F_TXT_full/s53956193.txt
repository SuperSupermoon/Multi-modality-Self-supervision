AP chest compared to ___: Diffuse pulmonary abnormality that developed yesterday has changed in appearance. Although the right lung with cephalization and background interstitial abnormality is likely pulmonary edema, either on the basis of volume overload, cardiac decompensation or blood transfusion-related acute lung injury, left lung has a distinctly and progressively nodular abnormality, although occasionally pulmonary edema present as acinar filling with round opacities likely these, one cannot make that assumption and I discussed with Dr. ___ ___ possibility of disseminated infection, including septicemia. Heart size is smaller, suggesting a decrease in intravascular volume. Pleural effusions are minimal, if any. No pneumothorax.
