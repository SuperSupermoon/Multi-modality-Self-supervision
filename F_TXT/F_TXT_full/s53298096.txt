Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. There is no definitive pneumothorax. There are persistent low lung volumes. Cardiomegaly is stable. There is small left pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectases have increased on the right. Left rib fractures are again noted. Opacity in the left lower lobe as mentioned before could be consolidation, atelectasis and/or contusion.
