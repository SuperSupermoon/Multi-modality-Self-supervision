In comparison with study of ___, there is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 4.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends into the stomach, though the side hole is probably still above the esophagogastric junction. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Right IJ catheter extends to the cavoatrial junction or upper portion of the right atrium.
