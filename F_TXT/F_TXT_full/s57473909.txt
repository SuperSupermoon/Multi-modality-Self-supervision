Tracheostomy tube is present, tip approximately 3.3 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip overlying the gastric fundus. Looped tubing overlying the right upper abdomen and a portion of what is likely an aortic stent are noted. No free air seen beneath the diaphragms on this semi supine view. Inspiratory volumes are low. There is cardiomegaly, which appears slightly less pronounced than on the prior film. There is upper zone redistribution. Again seen is a left base opacity with air bronchograms consistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Patchy opacity at the right infrahilar region is similar, possibly slightly improved. No gross effusion.
