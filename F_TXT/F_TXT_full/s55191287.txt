Comparison is made with prior study performed nine hours earlier. NG tube tip is in the stomach. ET tube is in the standard position. Left IJ catheter tip is at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins or upper SVC. There is no evident pneumothorax. Right basal pigtail catheter remains in unchanged position. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is stable. Left lower lobe opacities are a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. If any, there is a small right pleural effusion.
