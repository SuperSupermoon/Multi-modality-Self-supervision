The patient is rotated somewhat to the left. Enlarged of the cardiac silhouette persists. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is persistent left base opacity, similar as compared the prior study. In the interval since the prior study, there appears to be central pulmonary vascular congestion. Left perihilar opacity may relate to vascular congestion although superimposed infection is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
