A moderate right pleural effusion has increased in size and changed distribution now seen layering at the apex likely related to patient's position. Increased pulmonary opacification, right greater than left, has increased since yesterday likely representing pulmonary edema. Opacification at the right medial base could represent atelectasis, although consolidation is also possible. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No pneumothorax.
