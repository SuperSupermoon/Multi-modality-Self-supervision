Again seen is a left-sided PICC line with distal tip projecting over the mid SVC, in grossly appropriate location. New since prior is an enteric tube which courses inferiorly. The distal tip is not clearly seen due to overlying soft tissue/underpenetration, however the tip is at least beyond the GE junction probably overlying the stomach. The distal side port is not well seen. Otherwise, allowing for technical differences, doubt significant interval change in appearance of the lungs or mediastinal structures.
