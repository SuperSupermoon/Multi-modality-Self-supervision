In comparison with the study of ___, there is again evidence of enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion. The hazy opacification is at the bases, especially on the right, is less prominent. This is consistent with decreasing layering pleural effusions, though some of this apparent improvement may be related to a more upright position of the patient. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe. Old healed fracture of the proximal right humerus is again seen.
