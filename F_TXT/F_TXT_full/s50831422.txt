A portable AP radiograph of the chest once again demonstrates a stable small right pleural effusion and a chest tube in place. Although no pleural line is seen, the pulmonary vascular markings at the right apex are not as clearly visible on this study, raising concern for a small right apical pneumothorax. There is no effusion or pneumothorax on the left. There is right basilar atelectasis, but the lungs are otherwise clear. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no pulmonary edema.
