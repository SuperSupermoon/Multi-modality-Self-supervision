There is nearly complete opacification of the hemithorax but without substantial net shift of mediastinal structures. This may reflect a large pleural effusion with associated atelectasis or pneumonia but is incompletely characterized. Patchy opacification is noted in the right mid to lower lung with a suspected small pleural effusion on the right. The pulmonary vascularity in the right lung is mildly prominent, suggesting mild fluid overload.
