Intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3.5 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube shows a normal course, the sidehole is approximately 7 cm below the gastroesophageal junction. The tip of the device is not visualized on the image. A radiopaque dense foreign body projects over the course of the esophagus, just on the left lateral aspect of the nasogastric tube. A repeat radiograph could be performed to further evaluate potential mobility of this foreign body. Previous radiographs would also be helpful. The foreign body has a diameter of approximately 8 mm and could represent a tooth. Unremarkable aspect of the lung parenchyma. Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.
