Lungs are well expanded and clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart is normal size. Mediastinum in the region of the aortopulmonic window and ascending thoracic aorta is widened with convex lateral contours. This could be due to either adenopathy or enlarged aorta and/or pulmonary artery. Any prior radiograph should be obtained to see if this is a new finding warranting further investigation with chest CT.
