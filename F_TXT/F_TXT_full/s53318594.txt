AP chest compared to 10:16 a.m. today: There has been no interval change. Pulmonary vascular engorgement, left lower lobe atelectasis and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm are stable. A small left pleural effusion could be present, based on the conventional radiographic appearance, but subsequent chest CT scanning showed no appreciable pleural fluid collection. Right pleural surfaces are normal. The heart is probably not enlarged, though the apex is obscured by abnormalities in the left hemithorax.
