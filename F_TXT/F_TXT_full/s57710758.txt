An NG tube extends below the diaphragm. An epidural catheter is in place. A right Port-A-Cath ends in the inferior vena cava, approximately 5 cm below the cavoatrial junction, which is changed from prior when it terminated in the right atrium. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present. Central vascular engorgement and indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.
