Rotated positioning. ET tube tip in carina not well delineated, but the tube probably lies approximately 3.8 cm above the carina, at the level of the lower clavicular heads. NG type tube present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Dual-lumen left IJ line tip overlies proximal SVC. The previously seen Swan-Ganz catheter is no longer visualized. Right IJ line appears to correspond to a pacer tip which overlies the right ventricle. There are low inspiratory volumes, similar to prior. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, also similar to prior. Diffuse vascular plethora and vascular blurring is consistent with CHF with interstitial and possible pulmonary edema. Increased retrocardiac density again seen, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Probable small left effusion is also again seen. Hazy opacity at the right lung base could reflect some pleural fluid as well as a underlying atelectasis. No obvious pneumothorax detected
