Opacification within the right mid and lower lung fields likely reflects a combination of a moderate pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis. Infection or aspiration in the right lung base cannot be excluded. Cardiac silhouette size remains at least mildly enlarged, but difficult to assess on this exam due to the right basilar opacity. The aorta remains mildly tortuous. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Left lung is clear. No pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
