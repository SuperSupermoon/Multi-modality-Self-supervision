An ET tube is in place with tip 3.4 cm above the carina. An enteric tube extends inferiorly with side port in the stomach. A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter has tip in the mid SVC. Prominent mediastinal contour with widening likely represent a combination of vascular engorgement and underlying mediastinal lymphadenopathy compatible with lymphoma. Although mediastinal hematoma is not excluded status post new central line placement, lack of tracheal deviation makes this less likely. The cardiac silhouette is prominent. The lung volumes are low, with new interval development of a moderate left pleural effusion and dense retrocardiac opacity compatible with atelectasis. The right lung is relatively clear. A rounded density in the left supraclavicular soft tissues measures at least 5.2 x 4.4 cm, upon correlation with prior CT dated ___, consistent with a large centrally necrotic nodal mass.
