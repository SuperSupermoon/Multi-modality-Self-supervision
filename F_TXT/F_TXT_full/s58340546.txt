Following recent thoracentesis, a large right hydropneumothorax has developed. Due to markedly leftward patient rotation, it is difficult to assess for possible signs of tension. Moderate right pleural effusion appears slightly smaller fall thoracentesis. Otherwise no relevant change in the appearance of the chest since the recent study.
