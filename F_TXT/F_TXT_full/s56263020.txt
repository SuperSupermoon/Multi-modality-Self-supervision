Two right pigtail catheters are in place. Pneumothorax has decreased with small residual right apical pneumothorax. There is a background of severe emphysema with large apical bulla bilaterally. Again there is blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus likely reflecting some combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Overall appearance of the left lung is stable. Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
