Overall, no significant interval change. Persistent small left pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects a combination of atelectasis and a known hiatal hernia. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The lungs are otherwise clear without new focal consolidation, edema, or pneumothorax. No right pleural effusion.
