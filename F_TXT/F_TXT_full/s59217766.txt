Upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval development opacities within the superior segment of the right lower lobe as well as the left mid lung, consistent with aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting. Volume loss and pleural effusion on the right remains, along with post-surgical appearance after right upper and middle lobectomies. A posterior right rib resection is unchanged in appearance. The cardiac size is normal. Tendon anchors are present in the left humeral head, likely from prior rotator cuff repair.
