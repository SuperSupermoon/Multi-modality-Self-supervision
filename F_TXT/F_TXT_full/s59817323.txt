As compared to the previous image, the patient has received a Swan-Ganz catheter via a right internal jugular vein access. The course of the line is unremarkable. The tip projects over the right pulmonary artery. No complications, notably no pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions with subsequent areas of atelectasis persist.
