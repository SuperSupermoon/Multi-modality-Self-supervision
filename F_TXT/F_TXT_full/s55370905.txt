Right PICC tip terminates in the superior aspect of the SVC. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Linear opacity in left mid lung field likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but this is improved compared to the prior study. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are punctate radiopaque densities projecting over the right lung base, which are unchanged from the prior study.
