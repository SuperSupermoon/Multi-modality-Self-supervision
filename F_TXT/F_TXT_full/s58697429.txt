The lung volumes remain low. There is persistent pulmonary edema, unchanged compared to the prior radiograph. There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly as before. ET tube terminates 4.2 cm above the carina in the midtrachea. Bilateral central venous catheters terminate in the SVC. Enteric tube tip terminates in the region of the gastric pylorus. EKG leads overlie the chest wall. The right humeral head appears slightly subluxed cranially with nonvisualization of the distal third of the right clavicle, however these changes cannot be further characterized on this single semi upright radiograph.
