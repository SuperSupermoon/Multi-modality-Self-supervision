Comparison is made with prior studies including chest CT, ___ and chest ___, ___. Cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the right, as before. Left PICC tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC. There has been interval increase in air component in the right basal hydropneumothorax/empyema. Adjacent consolidation is unchanged. Diffuse lung opacities have worsened, consistent with worsening pulmonary edema superimposed on multifocal pneumonia. NG tube tip is in the duodenum. Cardiac size is normal. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is better seen in prior CT. Right basal pigtail catheter is unchanged.
