Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates slight interval increase in the degree of pulmonary edema, which is moderate. There are persistent bibasilar opacities come which may represent a combination of pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis. The patient is status post interval placement of a left-sided internal jugular central venous line, which ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Increased sclerosis of the visualized osseous structures likely relates to end-stage renal disease.
