The only area of improvement in lungs is the left lower lobe. The yet heterogeneous infiltrative pulmonary abnormality elsewhere is the same at, even though the patient has been extubated in the interim, suggesting more substantial improvement. Mild cardiomegaly unchanged. Pleural effusions are presumed, but small. No pneumothorax. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC
