As compared to the previous radiograph, the appearance of the aorta with its aneurysmal enlargement as well as of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. At the bases of the left lung, a small pleural effusion combined to a small atelectasis has developed. On the other hand, pre-existing subtle opacity at the right lung base is smaller and less extensive than before. No new parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
