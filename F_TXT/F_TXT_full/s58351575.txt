Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is likely stable, allowing for difference in patient positioning. Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left than the right, appear slightly smaller, though this may also be due to positioning. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. Again, the trachea is deviated rightward, due to prominent vessels, as previously identified on the prior CT. The heart size remains moderately enlarged, and unchanged.
