In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of a left subclavian catheter extends to the upper right atrium. It could be pulled back approximately 2.5 cm if the desired position of the tip is at or just above the cavoatrial junction. Low lung volumes accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Again there is engorgement of indistinct pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, possibly related to over hydration. The hemidiaphragms are not sharply seen and there is retrocardiac opacification, consistent with layering effusions and volume loss in the lower lobes. Given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be extremely difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view. The Dobhoff tube extends to the lower body of the stomach.
