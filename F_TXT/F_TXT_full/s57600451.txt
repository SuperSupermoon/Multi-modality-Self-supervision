Portable kyphotic upright chest radiograph demonstrates little change in low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis, although the pulmonary vasculature appears more indistinct suggesting interval development of pulmonary vascular engorgement and mild pulmonary edema. Pleural effusion is minimal if any. The central airways are heavily calcified. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, the mediastinal contours are indistinct. A left subclavian approach central venous catheter tip is positioned at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and SVC with the tip projecting laterally.
