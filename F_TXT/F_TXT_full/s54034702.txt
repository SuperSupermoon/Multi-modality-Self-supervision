The patient is status post median sternotomy and transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated with diffuse calcification of the thoracic aorta again noted. Mediastinal contour is stable with clips again demonstrated in the lower aspect of the neck likely related to prior thyroid surgery. Calcified bilateral pleural plaques are re- demonstrated which limit assessment of the underlying pulmonary parenchyma. There are likely streaky bibasilar airspace opacities, reflective of atelectasis. Small amount of right basal lateral pleural thickening versus fluid is noted. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
