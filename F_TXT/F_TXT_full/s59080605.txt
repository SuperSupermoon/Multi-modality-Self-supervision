AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes remain quite low, accounting in part for some apparent widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Supine positioning may contribute to this as well, but the ___ of the azygos vein suggests volume overload. Despite right basal pleural tube there is still a small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax, with attendant atelectasis in the upper lobe. Atelectasis at the left lung base is also persistent. There is no appreciable left pneumothorax or pleural effusion despite sharp folding of the left basal pleural tube. Nasogastric tube ends in a nondistended stomach.
