Interval near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax likely reflecting increasing pleural effusion or possibly hemorrhage into the pleural space. Clinical correlation is advised. A left basilar chest tube remains in place with the small pneumothorax seen on recent CT dated ___ not appreciated. A right basilar chest tube is again seen and there is a small but stable right apical pneumothorax. Stable small right effusion. Rounded lucency adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm on the previous study does not persist. Right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. Cardiac and mediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to the opacity of the left hemithorax. The patient is status post median sternotomy with valve replacement. Patchy opacity at the right lung base persists and may represent an area of atelectasis or pneumonia, less likely hemorrhage. Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
