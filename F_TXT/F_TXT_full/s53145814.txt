Endotracheal tube tip is 8 cm above the carina and right internal jugular line tip is in the mid SVC. Over the last approximately 17 hours, consolidation in the right lower lung and mild to moderately severe pulmonary edema have improved. Small right and presumed minimal left pleural effusions are unchanged. Heart size is top normal and stable. There is no mediastinal widening or hilar prominence. Orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, its distal end is off radiographic view.
