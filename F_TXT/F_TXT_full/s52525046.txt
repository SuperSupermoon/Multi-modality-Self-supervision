AP chest compared to ___: Even though lung volume has improved on the right, accounting in part for decrease caliber in crowding to the pulmonary vasculature, atelectasis at the left base above the chronically elevated left hemidiaphragm has worsened. This could be due to mucus plugging, in the setting of a severely eventrated or paralyzed left hemidiaphragm. Atelectasis in the infrahilar right lower lobe is mild. There is no pulmonary edema. Pleural effusions are small if any. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube, right subclavian line are in standard placements, but the upper alimentary tube can be traced with certainty only as far as the level of the carina though I am sure it goes beyond, although the tip cannot be identified. Heart size is normal.
