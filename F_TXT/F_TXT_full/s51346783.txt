AP chest compared to ___: Following right thoracentesis and insertion of the right pigtail pleural catheter, right pleural effusion though substantial is much smaller and there is no pneumothorax. Right lung is very abnormal, at least severe atelectasis and at the lateral aspect of the right mid lung, a 6 cm wide round opacity could be a mass or abscess. There may be a 2 cm wide nodule in the left mid lung, where there could be overlying pleural thickening. CT scanning would be definitive in clarifying the nature of lung abnormalities and residual volume of pleural fluid. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette could be due to pericardial effusion or paramediastinal pleural fluid in the right lower chest. Dr. ___ was paged.
