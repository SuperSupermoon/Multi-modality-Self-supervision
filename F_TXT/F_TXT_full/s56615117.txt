Heart is upper limits of normal in size. Lung volumes are relatively low. Multifocal pulmonary opacities are present in the left mid and both lower lungs, and are most confluent in the left retrocardiac region. Although at least a component of the opacities may be due to atelectasis,an evolving infectious pneumonia should be considered. Left pleural effusion is small.
