Chronic hyperinflation, in the absence of emphysema, is due to long-standing small airway obstruction. Differences in radiographic technique may explain the change in contour of the diaphragmatic interface of the right lung, but it would be prudent to evaluate that with conventional radiographs to make sure there is no pneumonia. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is also chronic. Mitral annulus calcification is noted, occasionally this is hemodynamically significant, but there is no evidence of cardiac decompensation.
