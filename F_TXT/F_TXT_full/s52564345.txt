Tracheostomy tube, multiple median sternotomy wires, right mediastinal clips, and descending thoracic aorta stent and graft appears similar to the prior exam. The lungs are hyperexpanded. No significant interval change from the prior exam. No pneumothorax. No focal consolidation, edema, or large pleural effusion. Slight blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles may reflect scarring or trace effusions. Appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is overall unchanged. Deformity of the right posterior a lateral ninth rib may reflect healed prior rib fracture.
