There are diffuse alveolar opacities involving upper and lower lobes of both lungs. Differential considerations are broad and include diffuse pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, and multifocal pneumonia. Additionally, there is blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggesting some component of pleural fluid on the left. Mild enlargement of hilar contours may be secondary to adenopathy or engorged vasculature. Evaluation of cardiac size is limited due to diffuse opacities. There is no pneumothorax.
