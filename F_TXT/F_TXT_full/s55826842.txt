In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification at the left base with a triangular opacification extending from medial to lateral. This is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe, possibly related to mucus plugging. Remainder of the study shows hyperexpansion, but no acute focal pneumonia.
