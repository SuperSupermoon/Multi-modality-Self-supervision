As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Mild fluid overload. Moderate cardiomegaly and substantial left lower lobe atelectasis. The pre-existing opacity at the left apex and at the right lung basis are constant in appearance. No new parenchymal opacities. The presence of a small left pleural effusion can not be excluded.
