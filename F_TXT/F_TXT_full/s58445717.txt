In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular level, approximately 6.3 cm above the carina. The OGT tube is coiled in the upper stomach, with the side port at about the level of the esophagogastric junction. The tube should be pushed forward for better positioning. Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
