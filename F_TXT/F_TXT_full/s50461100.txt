Portable frontal chest radiograph shows no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. Changes of severe panlobular emphysema are again noted and are consistent with the patient's known history of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency. Heart size is normal and smaller than prior. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Streaky atelectasis/scarring is seen throughout both lungs. A left MediPort catheter terminates in the RA/SVC junction.
