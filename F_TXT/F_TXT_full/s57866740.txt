A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular crowding. The heart is slightly larger with perihilar fullness and indistinct pulmonary vasculature, suggesting mild pulmonary edema. New opacities at the lung bases, right more than left, may be due to edema versus concurrent aspiration or infection. A tiny left pleural effusion is new. No pneumothorax. Mediastinal silhouette is stable.
