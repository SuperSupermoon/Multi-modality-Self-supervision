Comparison is made with prior study ___. Left lower lobe opacities have increased consistent with increasing pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Right lower lobe opacity is grossly unchanged, a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Cardiomegaly is stable. Pacer leads are in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. It is looped in the right IJ as before. There is no pneumothorax. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged.
