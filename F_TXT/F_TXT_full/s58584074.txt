Compared to the prior study, the patient is in true AP position, without rotation. A left IJ central line is present. Allowing for differences in patient rotation, left IJ line tip appears to been retracted slightly compared with the prior film. It now lies slightly to the left of the expected site of confluence of the left brachiocephalic and right subclavian veins. It does not clearly reach the SVC. The opacity in the expected location of the azygous vein measures approximately 6.6 mm, larger than a normal azygos vein. Overall, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar and hazy opacities in both bases are also similar. As before, the right hemidiaphragm is partially obscured and there is dense increased retrocardiac density. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora. No pneumothorax detected. ET tube and NG tube again noted.
