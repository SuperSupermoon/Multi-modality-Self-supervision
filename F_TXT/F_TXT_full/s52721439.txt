A PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava. The patient is status post fusion of the lumbar spine and sternotomy. The base of the chest is not completely included, but cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Hazy opacification projecting over the lower lungs suggests persistent pleural effusions. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear, however. There is no pneumothorax.
