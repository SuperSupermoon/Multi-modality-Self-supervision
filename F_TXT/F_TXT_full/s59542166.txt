In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is no definite pneumothorax with the right chest tube in place. Central catheter remains in good position. The nasogastric tube appears to have been removed. On the left, there has been substantial improvement in the opacification with sharpness of the hemidiaphragm. This would be consistent with resolving pleural fluid, though some of the apparent change it may merely reflect a more upright position of the patient. Otherwise little change.
