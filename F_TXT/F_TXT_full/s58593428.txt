CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with earlier the same day, the ET tube, NG tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, chest tubes, and ?mediastinal drains have all been removed. Allowing for differences in technique and lower inspiratory volumes, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. Plate-like atelectasis in the right mid zone, which was previously associated with a right chest tube, has improved. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. No pneumothorax is detected.
