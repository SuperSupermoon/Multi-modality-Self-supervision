Radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessing the placement of a nasogastric tube, which courses into the distal stomach. Within the imaged portion of the chest, note is made of interval intubation, with tip of endotracheal tube terminating 4.8 cm above the carina. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, is accompanied by worsening pulmonary vascular congestion and mild perihilar edema. Enlarging bilateral pleural effusions are present, now moderate in size and accompanied by worsening bibasilar atelectasis. Diffuse haziness of upper abdomen raises the possibility of ascites.
