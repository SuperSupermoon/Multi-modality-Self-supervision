Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits given portable technique. There is calcification of the aortic knob consistent with atherosclerosis. In addition, there are some unusual calcifications projecting over two of the mid thoracic vertebrae which could reflect ascending aortic calcifications, calcified mediastinal lymph nodes, or possibly sclerotic vertebrae. Correlation with a lateral film would be helpful. A 5-mm calcified nodule is seen in the left costophrenic angle, likely representing a calcified granuloma. Lung volumes are relatively low without evidence of pulmonary edema, focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax. Clips are seen overlying the right axilla, suggesting prior lymph node dissection.
