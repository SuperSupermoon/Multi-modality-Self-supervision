Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. A right subclavian venous stent is again noted. There are pleural effusions, right greater than left. There is hazy opacity obscuring the majority of the right mid-lower lung which is most compatible with pulmonary edema, though a component of the layering effusion is also possible. Pulmonary edema is less evident in the left lung. The heart size is difficult to assess but appears grossly stable. Atherosclerotic calcification along the thoracic aorta noted. Tracheobronchial tree calcification is also noted. Bony structures are intact. Clips in the upper abdomen noted.
