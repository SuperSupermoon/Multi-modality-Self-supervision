Compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Lungs show higher volumes, likely reflecting improved ventilation. There is minimal fluid overload and atelectasis at both lung bases, notably in the retrocardiac lung regions. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pneumonia. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
