Single chest drain remains in the right hemithorax. No right pneumothorax. The right lung shows improved aeration compared to the previous radiograph. Slight decrease in the mediastinal shift to the right. The cardiothoracic index is normal. Compensatory hyperinflation of the left lung with herniation across the midline. Increased density in the medial aspect of the left lower lobe appears similar compared to imaging done yesterday.
