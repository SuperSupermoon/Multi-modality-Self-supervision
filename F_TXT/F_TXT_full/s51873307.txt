An NG tube is present, the tip overlies the gastric fundus. A sideport, if present, is not well visualized. Note is made of several mildly dilated loops of small bowel in the mid upper abdomen. The appearance is in keeping with findings on an abdominal CT obtained the same day. Inspiratory volumes are low, with bibasilar atelectasis. Mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by low lung volumes. There is upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. No gross effusion.
