The right costophrenic sulcus is omitted from view. There are bilateral opacities with a predominance at the bases. The heart is not enlarged. There is central pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Surgical clips project over the right axilla and slightly more inferiorly and irregular opacity is likely outside of the thoracic cavity, however, confirmation with lateral radiograph would be necessary. Curvilinear lucency projecting to the right of the trachea is likely a deviated esophagus.
