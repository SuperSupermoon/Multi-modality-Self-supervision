Supine portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates hazy multifocal opacities involving the right upper and lower lobes as well as the left lower lobe which have increased in density since the prior study. The endotracheal and nasogastric tubes are in appropriate position. A right subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged in position, terminating in the low SVC. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
