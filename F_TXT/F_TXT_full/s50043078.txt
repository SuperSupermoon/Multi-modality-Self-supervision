Heterogeneous opacification in the right mid and lower lungs has increased. Whether this is pneumonia or combination of atelectasis and increasing small right pleural effusion is radiographically indeterminate. Small left pleural effusion and moderate cardiomegaly unchanged. No pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is engorged, but there is no good evidence for edema. ET tube and transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads, right jugular line and esophageal drainage tube ending in the stomach are in standard placements respectively.
