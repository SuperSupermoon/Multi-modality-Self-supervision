AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. Lower lung volumes with new discoid atelectasis in the right mid lung are noted. The left lung patchy opacities are diffuse, unchanged. The appearance most likely reflects pulmonary edema. Overall, there is progression of those abnormalities as compared to prior study obtained several hours earlier. No pneumothorax is seen. Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.
