AP chest compared to ___: ET tube in standard placement. Right central venous catheter ends low in the SVC. Moderate cardiomegaly has actually improved since ___ and there is no pulmonary vascular engorgement or edema to suggest cardiac decompensation. Bibasilar opacification at least on the left has a large component of lower lobe consolidation. There is at least moderate pleural effusion bilaterally. The extent of right lower lobe atelectasis is indeterminate, and if differentiation of severe atelectasis from pleural effusion is clinically relevant, I would strongly recommend either conventional chest radiographs including a lateral view, or chest CT scanning.
