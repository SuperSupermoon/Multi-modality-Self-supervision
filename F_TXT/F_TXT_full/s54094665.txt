Dual lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the proximal right atrium. Lung volumes are low. Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. Mild pulmonary edema persists with unchanged mediastinal and hilar contours. Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present, though assessment of the lung apices is obscured by the patient's chin and soft tissues of the neck projecting over these areas. Remote fracture of the left posterior fifth rib is re- demonstrated.
