Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Apart from atelectasis in the lung bases, lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Widening of the right acromioclavicular joint is likely related to prior surgery, unchanged.
