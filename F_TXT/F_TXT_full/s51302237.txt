Status post endotracheal intubation. Mediastinal contour widening with a capped appearance of the right apex. This appearance is nonspecific but includes the possibility of aortic syndrome or mediastinal mass. CT is recommended to evaluate further on an urgent basis when feasible clinically. Nonspecific patchy right upper and left lower lung opacities. Differential considerations are broad and include atelectasis and pneumonia, which is probably the etiology regarding the right upper lobe opacity. These can also be reassessed with CT. Findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 7:45 p.m. at the time of interpretation by telephone.
