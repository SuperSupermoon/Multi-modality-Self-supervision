Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are stable. There has been interval improvement in aeration of the bilateral upper lungs, consistent with improved pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The right-sided central line ends in the right atrium, in unchanged position. Endotracheal tube ends 2 cm from the carina, and the cuff appears over-inflated.
