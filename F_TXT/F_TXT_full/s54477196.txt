Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation. Cardiac silhouette size appears within normal limits. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable. Lungs are hyperinflated with attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices likely reflective of underlying emphysema. Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is demonstrated.
