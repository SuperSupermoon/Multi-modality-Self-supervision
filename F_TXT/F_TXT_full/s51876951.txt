Cardiac size is top-normal. Left PICC tip is in the cavoatrial junction. Diffuse bilateral opacities, multiple cavitary septic pulmonary emboli and pneumonia, larger in the right lower lobe, have improved on the right. Small bilateral effusions greater on the right are probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Small left lateral pneumothorax is stable. .
