AP chest compared to ___ and ___: Right apical consolidation partially obsecured by the right clavical could be consolidation due to pneumonia or even rapidly enlarging mass. Right lung base is partially obscured by mediastinal contents. Supine positioning and rotation may account in part for apparent increase in diameter of the cardiac silhouette, but small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is new, and therefore pericardial effusion needs to be considered. There is no pulmonary edema. ET tube in standard placement, upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
