Since the prior study the has been insertion of pigtail catheter in the left pleural space at the mid aspect. As a consequence there has been interval substantial decrease in the amount of pleural effusion in particular at the basal aspect of the pleura. Currently the effusion continues to be loculated containing multiple foci of air, most likely trapped within the effusion. The prior study there has been interval elevation of the hemidiaphragm, slight potentially due to decrease in the amount of pleural fluid with subsequent slight right mediastinal shift. Left chest wall air is demonstrated along the tract of the catheter. No pneumothorax seen outside of the fluid collection. No appreciable pericardial effusion is seen. Minimal amount of right pleural fluid is demonstrated, increased since the prior study. Imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrate large cortical cyst in the left kidney as well as gallbladder sludge and foci of calcification in the right kidney. Airways are patent to the subsegmental level bilaterally except fall left lower lobe and lingula where atelectasis is noted most likely due to combination of effusion and elevated left hemidiaphragm. Except for minimal a right lower lung atelectasis right lung is clear. Off note is soft tissue lesion, 2.3 x 1.7 cm, pleural or extrapleural based, series 4, image 148, unchanged in appearance since previous CT obtained 2 days ago. No lytic or sclerotic lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm demonstrated. Erosive changes at the manubrial sternal joint suggesting prior inflammation as previously. Septal thickening in the left upper lobe is minimal. Besides left lower lobe atelectasis no new findings demonstrated.
