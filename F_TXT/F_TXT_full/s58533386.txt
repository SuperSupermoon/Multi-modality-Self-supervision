In comparison with study of ___, following biopsy, there is no definite pneumothorax. There is some possible additional prominence of the mediastinum on the right, which could reflect some post-procedure bleeding. Dense streak of atelectasis is seen at the right base with a smaller streak at the left base. Otherwise, little overall change.
