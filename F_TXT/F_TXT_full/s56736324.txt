Multiple lines and tubes have been removed. Right IJ central line remains present, tip over proximal SVC. There are low inspiratory volumes. Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, consistent with prior surgery and likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted . There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Hazy density both lung bases could represent atelectasis and/or small amount of pleural fluid. No gross effusion is identified. Doubt CHF. No pneumothorax detected.
