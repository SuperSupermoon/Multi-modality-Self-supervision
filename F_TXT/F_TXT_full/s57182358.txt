An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.3 cm above the carina, in appropriate location. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are stable. The bilateral hila are obscured. Diffuse opacification of the bilateral lungs is consistent with bilateral layering pleural effusions, better assessed on prior same-day CT chest. Diffuse interstitial prominence with a central prominence is compatible with at least mild pulmonary edema. No focal lung consolidation is appreciated. There is no pneumothorax.
