The heart is mildly enlarged most likely reflecting cardiomegaly. There are multiple calcifications in the right upper lobe suggestive of prior granulomatous infection. Clinical correlation is advised. The right hilum appears slightly prominent, but this is felt to most likely be related to patient rotation on the current study rather than lymphadenopathy. No pulmonary edema. Bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflect atelectasis or scarring. No focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pneumothorax. No large effusions.
