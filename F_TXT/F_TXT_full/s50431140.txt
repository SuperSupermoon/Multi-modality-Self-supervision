The tracheostomy tubes, chest tube, gastrostomy tube, and the bilateral bronchial stents are unchanged. There is complete opacification of the right lung, which is a progression from previous chest radiograph. The new right lower lung opacification could represent increased pleural effusion and progression of the right lung mass with now more vertical orientation of the right mainstem bronchus. The left lung is clear with persistent lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. No fractures.
