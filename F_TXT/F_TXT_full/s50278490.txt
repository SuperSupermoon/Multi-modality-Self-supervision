As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased. This could reflect improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressures. A pre-existing potential minimal right pleural effusion is no longer seen, a pre-existing small atelectasis on the right is no longer visible. A retrocardiac atelectasis persists. The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. If present, however, this effusion has not increased in size. Two hyperlucent lines at the level of the left apicolateral hemithorax are caused by skin folds. Currently, no pneumothorax is identified with certainty. The left chest tube is in unchanged position. Unchanged position of the endotracheal tube and of the right internal jugular vein catheter as well as of the vertebral stabilization devices.
