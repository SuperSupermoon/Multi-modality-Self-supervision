Comparison is made to the previous study from ___. There are right subclavian and IJ catheters with distal lead tips at the cavoatrial junction. Endotracheal tube tip is at the level of the clavicles, 6.3 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. Enteric tube is seen with distal tip below the field of view of the study but below the GE junction. The heart size is within normal limits. There are no pneumothoraces. There remains some atelectasis and some increased density at the left base which is slightly increased from prior. Continued attention to this area is recommended on subsequent films.
