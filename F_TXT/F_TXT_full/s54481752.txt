Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a previously seen small left pleural effusion with two pleural tubes in unchanged position compared to the prior study. The right lung opacification is also again seen, and likely represents a combination of atelectasis with a small effusion. There is no pneumothorax or significant pulmonary edema. The heart size is unchanged since the prior study. Apical pleural thickening is also noted.
