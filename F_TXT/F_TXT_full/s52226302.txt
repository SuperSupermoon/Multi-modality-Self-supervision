As compared to the previous image, a left chest tube has been removed. The extent of the left pneumothorax is unchanged. At the level of the left costophrenic sinus, there still is evidence of a small left fluid retention. The lung parenchyma is otherwise unremarkable. Postoperative changes surround the left hilus. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung bases.
