Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly has minimally increased. Attention on this finding should be paid. This could be due to technique, but we cannot exclude the presence of pericardial effusion. Moderate right and small left effusions have increased with increasing adjacent opacities on the right base, consistent with increasing atelectasis. Component of pulmonary edema that is mild-to-moderate is grossly unchanged from prior. No pneumothorax.
