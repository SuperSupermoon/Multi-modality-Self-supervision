Right-sided pleural catheter is in place with a small loculated right apical hydropneumothorax, and a persistent moderate-sized, partially loculated right pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but similar in size to the previous study. Heterogeneous opacities in the right mid and lower lung regions have slightly improved, and left retrocardiac atelectasis has also slightly decreased. Small left pleural effusion is again demonstrated, and there is no evidence of left pneumothorax.
