In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration. There is still mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Hemodialysis catheter is now in place with the tip at the cavoatrial junction or in the right atrium. There is again suggestion of some increased opacification in the left mid and lower zones. This could represent an area of consolidation, though a lateral view would be most helpful for further evaluation. The right lung base also shows some mild opacification. This is less prominent than on the previous study, but this could merely reflect the better degree of inspiration.
