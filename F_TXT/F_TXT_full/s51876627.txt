The tip of the endotracheal tube is 3 cm above the carina. This could be pulled back 1 cm for more optimal placement. The right-sided central line has the distal lead tip in the cavoatrial junction, stable. The right IJ central line has the distal lead tip in the mid SVC. It is pulled back slightly; it is now oblique to the SVC wall. There are again seen bilateral pleural effusions and left retrocardiac opacity. There is likely an unchanged element of mild fluid overload, stable. The nasogastric tube side port is again at the GE junction.
