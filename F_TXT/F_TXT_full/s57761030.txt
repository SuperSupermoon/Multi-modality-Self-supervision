Lung volumes are significantly lower and there is bibasilar atalectasis. Right infrahilar atalectasis is mild. Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes and AP technique and is likely normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Rightward deviation of the cervical trachea reflects known goiter.
