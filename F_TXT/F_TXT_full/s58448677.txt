Portable supine chest radiograph demonstrates superior migration of the endotracheal tube which is now located at least 6.3 cm from the level of the carina, with the change in position likely the result of the change in neck extension. An NG tube is in place, its tip is not seen below the inferior margin of the film. An esophageal temperature probe is in place. A right subclavian central venous catheter tip is located at the cavoatrial junction. The lungs are clear, with somewhat low lung volumes. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
