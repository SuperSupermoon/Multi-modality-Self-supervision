A tracheostomy is not visualized on this study. Lung volumes remain low, left basilar atelectasis is similar to slightly progressed compared to the prior study. Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and bilateral likely reflects mild pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation seen. Probable small left pleural effusion.
