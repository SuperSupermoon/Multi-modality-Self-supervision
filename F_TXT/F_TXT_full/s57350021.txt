AP portable view of the chest: Extensive opacification of the right hemi thorax the combination of atelectasis, particularly of the right upper lobe, as well as a moderate-sized pleural effusion with right lower lobe atelectasis as well. The mediastinum is shifted to the right owing to the atelectasis. The left lung by comparison is essentially clear aside from minimal bibasilar atelectasis. Heart size is probably within normal limits. The large amount of free intra-abdominal air is similar in quantity to 4 days prior.
