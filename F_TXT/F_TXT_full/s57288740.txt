Multifocal bilateral regions of airspace opacification have progressed in the interval, with multiple new sites of consolidation, particularly within the right lung as well as overall worsening of consolidation in the left lung. Observed findings may be due to acute aspiration superimposed upon known underlying pneumonia. Rapid progression of pneumonia is an additional consideration. Bilateral small pleural effusions are present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
