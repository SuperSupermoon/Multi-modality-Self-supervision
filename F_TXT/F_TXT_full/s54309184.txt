In comparison with the earlier study of this date, right chest tube is in place and the ipsilateral lung has substantially re-expanded with a small residual pneumothorax. Mediastinal contents are now in normal position though there is some continued increased opacification in the left lung. Tip of the endotracheal tube is now properly positioned about 4 cm above the carina.
