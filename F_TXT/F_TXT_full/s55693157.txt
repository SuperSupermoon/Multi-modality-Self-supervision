Support and monitoring devices are in standard position. The patient is severely rotated towards the right, limiting assessment of cardiomediastinal contours. Apparent worsening opacity in the right lower lobe with associated partial obscuration of right heart border favors atelectasis, but coexisting infectious pneumonia is possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Adjacent right pleural effusion is probably not changed.
