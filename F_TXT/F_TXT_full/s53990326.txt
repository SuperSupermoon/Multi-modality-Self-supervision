As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral parenchymal opacities at the lung bases have improved. Also improved is the pre-existing left pleural effusion. Retrocardiac atelectasis and remnant opacities, however, persist. No new opacities. The lung volumes remain low. Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.
