As compared to the previous radiograph, a new left-sided chest tube was placed. There is a minimal improvement in the grade of expansion of the left lung but a substantial amount of left pleural fluid persists. The lung volumes have decreased, visually emphasizing the diameter of the vasculature. Nonetheless, mild to moderate pleural edema is present.
