Evaluation of the lung apices is limited by the head position. Within this limitation, lung volumes are low. There is basilar atelectasis. There is no large consolidation. Rounded opacity over the lower mediastinum suggests a hiatal hernia. There is no pneumothorax. Imaged portion of the cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. Mediastinal silhouette, hilar contours and pulmonary vasculature are normal. Osseous structures are normal.
