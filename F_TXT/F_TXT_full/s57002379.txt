AP chest compared to ___: Pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature are engorged. The cardiac silhouette is partially obscured by markedly elevated left hemidiaphragm, and attendant atelectasis, exacerbated by worsening of severe gaseous distention of the stomach. Pulmonary edema is mild, if any. New opacification at the right lung base could be due to aspiration or atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not appreciable in size. Dr. ___ was paged at 9:30 a.m. and we discussed the findings by telephone at 9:35.
