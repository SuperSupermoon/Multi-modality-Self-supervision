As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are constant. Constant atelectatic opacities at the right lung base as well as extensive left lower lobe opacity. Additional plate-like opacities seen at the level of the hilus. The changes can be due to either pneumonia or atelectasis, or a combination of both. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without signs of overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
