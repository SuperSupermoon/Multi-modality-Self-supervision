Poor inspiratory effort time. There is evidence of increase in bibasilar pleural effusions. There is also some peribronchial cuffing and mild cephalization. Increased linear opacity in the left base identified, most consistent with atelectasis although an evolving infection might have a similar appearance. Findings are overall consistent with the clinical suspicion of congestive change.
