The heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Minimal streaky opacities are noted within the lung bases. This could reflect atelectasis. Prominent nipple shadow is seen on the left. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. Clips are noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen denoting prior cholecystectomy. 2 additional clips are also seen projecting over the right inferior hemithorax.
