Stable cardiac enlargement. There is right basilar and lateral pleural thickening with associated patchy basilar airspace disease which could reflect atelectasis. There has been interval removal of the left chest tubes with residual patchy basilar opacity likely representing areas of atelectasis. Possible tiny left apical pneumothorax given the presence of an area of focal lucency at the apex. Follow up imaging is advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
