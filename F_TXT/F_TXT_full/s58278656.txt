AP chest compared to ___, 11:29 a.m.: Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular engorgement are unchanged. Peribronchial opacification at the right and left lung bases has increased, could be due to atelectasis alone or aspiration. Leftward displacement of the trachea in the neck is new or newly apparent. A soft tissue contour to the right of midline at the thoracic inlet is unexplained. Patient should be evaluated clinically for possibility of abscess or hematoma if line placement attempt was made. I discussed these findings with the caring physician by telephone at 10:20 a.m. when the chest radiograph was reviewed.
