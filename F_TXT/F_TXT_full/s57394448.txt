In comparison with the study of ___, the Dobbhoff tube is been removed and replaced with a nasogastric tube that extends to the mid body of the stomach. There is evidence of free intraperitoneal gas, presumably related to the patient calling out the PEG tube. No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion. Tracheostomy tube appears unchanged.
