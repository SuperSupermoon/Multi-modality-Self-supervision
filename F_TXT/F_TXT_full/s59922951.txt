1. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. A left basilar chest tube remains in place. Lung volumes are low. Layering bilateral effusions with associated airspace opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. In addition, there is increasing indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature and fullness of the perihilar vasculature consistent with superimposed mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the airspace process and patient rotation on the current study.
