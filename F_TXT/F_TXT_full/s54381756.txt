Pleural catheters remain in place in the lower right hemithorax. A small right apical pneumothorax has decreased in size since the prior study, and a loculated basilar hydropneumothorax is again demonstrated with slight increase in the fluid component. Otherwise, no relevant changes since the recent chest radiograph of one day earlier.
