An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip terminates approximately 4 cm above the level the carina. A nasogastric tube is coiled in the esophagus and extends back towards the mouth. Lung volumes are within normal limits. The trachea is central. The cardiomediastinal contour is normal allowing for the projection. Mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature is likely due to fluid overload. No frank pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions.
