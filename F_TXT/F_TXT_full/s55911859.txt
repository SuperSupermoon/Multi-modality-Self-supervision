As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen in appearance of the Swan-Ganz catheter, the aortic balloon pump and the pacemaker leads. The Swan-Ganz catheter could be slightly pulled back, by approximately 2-3 cm. The tip of the aortic balloon pump projects approximately 5 mm be low the upper most portion of the aortic arch. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Likely calcified left ventricular aneurysm. No pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions.
