The endotracheal tube ends 5.9 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach with the tip out of view. Right PICC ends in the upper SVC. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Mild linear atelectasis in the left lower lung is new, although lung volumes are lower than on the prior study. There is no focal consolidation, substantial pleural effusion, or pneumothorax, although the left costophrenic sulcus is incompletely imaged. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are stable allowing for patient position.
