There has been interval retraction of endotracheal tube, with distal tip now positioned approximately 4 cm above the carina. There has been interval placement of a left IJ central line, whose distal tip projects over the mid SVC. An NG tube is again seen coursing inferiorly with distal tip and side port projecting over the left upper quadrant. Lower lung opacities are concerning for aspiration/ pneumonia.
