Again seen is the pigtail left-sided chest tube coursing mediallyand apically. There may be a remnant trace left-sided pneumothorax. Left-sided PICC line is unchanged in position. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in appearance. Again noted is a mild to moderate degree of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions as well as a left basilar and right apical parenchymal opacity. Overall the findings are little changed.
