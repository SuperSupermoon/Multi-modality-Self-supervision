The chin and overlying soft tissues partially obscure the bilateral lung apices. Small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since the study of 5 days prior. Bilateral airspace opacities have substantially improved in the right lung, but persist at the left base. A tubular opacity projecting over the heart may be due to coronary calcifications or stents. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is stable. Extensive vascular calcifications are incidentally noted.
