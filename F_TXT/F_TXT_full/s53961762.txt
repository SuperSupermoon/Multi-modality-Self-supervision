The left chest tube has been removed and a new left pigtail catheter projects over the left lung apex. The previously seen large left pneumothorax is now very small, with lucency abutting the aortic knob. Bilateral patchy opacities are unchanged. No pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There are bilateral rib fractures and subcutaneous gas over the left chest wall.
