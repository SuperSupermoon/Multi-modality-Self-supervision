Single frontal radiograph of the chest the mediastinum is shifted to the right with opacification along the right heart border likely representing volume loss in the left lower lobe and middle lobe related to atelectasis. There is a moderate right pleural effusion. Opacity at right base could represent a combination of atelectasis effusion. There is a convex border to the left mediastinum reflecting the opacity seen on CT in the left lower lobe consistent with rounded atelectasis. No left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
