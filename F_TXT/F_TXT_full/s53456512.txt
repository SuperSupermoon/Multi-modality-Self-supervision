New left internal jugular line ends in the low SVC. Transvenous right atrial right ventricular pacer leads continuous from the left pectoral generator.

This is pneumonia and/or pulmonary hemorrhage. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left, has increased since ___, probablya reflection of previous transient heart failure.
