An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip terminates approximately 7.2 cm above the carina, unchanged compared to the prior study. This could be advanced for more secure seating. There are unchanged bibasilar opacities, most prominent along the right heart border. Again, this likely reflects aspiration or atelectasis in the setting of intubation. No pneumothorax seen. No rib fracture seen. A nasoenteric tube is in-situ, the tip is not visualized on this study but appears to be below the left hemidiaphragm.
