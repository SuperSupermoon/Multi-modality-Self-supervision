Endotracheal tube has been advanced slightly, now terminating about 2.5 cm above the carina. Central venous catheter has apparently been slightly withdrawn since previous study with tip now at or just below the cavoatrial junction. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Appearance of the lungs is essentially unchanged except for slight obscuration of a small portion of the peripheral right hemidiaphragm. It is uncertain whether this represents a focal area of right basilar atelectasis or consolidation, or if it reflects a newly developed small right pleural effusion. Attention to this area on followup radiograph may be helpful in this regard.
