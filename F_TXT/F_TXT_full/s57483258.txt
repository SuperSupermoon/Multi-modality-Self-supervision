A portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval repositioning of the Swan-Ganz catheter, which now likely terminates at the proximal right pulmonary artery. Sternal wires, a nasogastric tube which extends below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image, ___ mediastinal drains, and epicardial pacing leads are all unchanged in position. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains normal. The lungs are clear, without focal consolidation or large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
