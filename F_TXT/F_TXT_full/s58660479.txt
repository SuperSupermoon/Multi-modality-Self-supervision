In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly better lung volumes with little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and there is evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Left base opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural fluid patchy area of opacification is seen at the right base. This could represent some asymmetric pulmonary edema or atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered.
