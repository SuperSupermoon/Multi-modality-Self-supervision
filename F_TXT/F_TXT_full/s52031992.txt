Portable frontal view of the chest shows opacity at the left lung base with pleural thickening extending up to the left hilus and is again consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma. A small left pleural effusion is presumed as seen on the prior cross-sectional imaging. Increased opacities within this region on ___ could reflect superimposed pneumonia, atelectasis or lymphangitic spread of tumor. The right lung is clear. The heart size is difficult to assess given the parenchymal abnormalities. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema.
