The prior chest radiographs suggest a dilated ascending thoracic aorta. This region is obscured on the current examination. There is clearly mediastinal venous distention, accompanied by pulmonary vascular redistribution in the upper lungs and mild edema in the lower. There is substantial atelectasis in the right lower lung, less severe on the left. Pleural effusion is probably moderate on the right and smaller on the left. The extent of cardiomegaly is difficult to assess. A oval opacity in the right mid lung could be either pulmonary or fissural pleural fluid. I would recommend chest CT scanning in order to discriminate the pulmonary from the pleural abnormalities. There is no pneumothorax.
