Interval appearance of a moderate to large right pleural fluid collection with decreased aeration in the right mid and lower lung likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although an underlying mass or pneumonia cannot be excluded. The left lung is grossly clear. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely not significantly changed given differences in positioning and technique. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema.
