The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The heart is moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Central pulmonary vascularity is prominent, with upper zone redistribution and indistinct appearance suggesting mild vascular congestion. In addition, there is a widespread new focal opacity projecting over the right lower lung, obscuring the right heart border and likely within the right middle lobe. There are also streaky left infrahilar opacities with air bronchograms. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
