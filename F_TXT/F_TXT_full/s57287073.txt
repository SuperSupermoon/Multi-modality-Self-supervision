As seen on the prior CT there is a very large Bochdalek's type hernia containing multiple loops of small and large bowel. This limits assessment of the lung bases. There is a small right pleural effusion. No definite left pleural effusion seen. There is left basilar atelectasis. Lung volumes are consequently low. No pneumothorax or consolidation seen.
