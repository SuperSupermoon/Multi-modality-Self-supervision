In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is some increased haziness at the left base, most likely reflecting layering effusion, though superimposed aspiration cannot be excluded. Generalized haziness of the right hemithorax is again seen and there is evidence of fixation device in the thoracic region. The left hemidiaphragm is poorly seen medially, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Endotracheal and tube and central catheters are unchanged.
