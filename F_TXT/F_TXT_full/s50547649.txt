CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW An NG tube is present, new compared with ___. The tip is difficult to trace beyond the level of the lower mediastinum, though this could be due to technical factors. A right PICC line, with tip over proximal SVC, is again noted. No pneumothorax detected. The left pleural effusion is smaller or resolved and there is residual left base atelectasis, which is improved compared with the prior study. No CHF or focal infiltrate identified.
