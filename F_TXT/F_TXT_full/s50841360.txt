Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 5.4 cm above the carina. The NG tube is also new with its tip extending to the left upper abdomen. Patient rotated to the left which limits evaluation. Opacities in the lower lungs are essentially unchanged, though perhaps minimally increased on the left.
