AP portable semi upright view of the chest. The relative increase in left mid - upper lung ground-glass opacity likely reflects layering pleural fluid. The volume of left pleural effusion appears increased since the PET-CT. Left basal consolidation may also be increased and could reflect increasing atelectasis versus pneumonia. Right lung grossly clear and known pulmonary nodules cannot be clearly visualized. No definite signs of superimposed pneumonia on the right. No convincing signs of edema.
