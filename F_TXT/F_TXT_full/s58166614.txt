Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal of the NG tube. There is interval resolution of left lower lobe atelectasis. The comparison of the cardiac silhouette re-demonstrates presence of substantial cardiomegaly. The left internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction, and the right central venous line tip is at the right atrium. As compared to ___ radiograph, the cardiac silhouette appears to be enlarged as also potentially compared to ___, thus pericardial effusion is a possibility and should be correlated with echocardiography. Bilateral pleural effusions are present as well as bibasal atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen.
