Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities are seen, increased compared to the prior exam, right greater than left with blunting of the right costophrenic angles, likely secondary to small bilateral pleural effusions. A right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen, terminating at the cavoatrial junction. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess on the background of the parenchymal opacities.
