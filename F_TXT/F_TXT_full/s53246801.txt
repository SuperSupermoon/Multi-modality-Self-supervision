Patient is status post median sternotomy, aortic valve replacement, and CABG. Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. There is persistent moderate pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
