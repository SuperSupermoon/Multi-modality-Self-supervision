Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with cardiac size top normal. Patient is extubated. Diffuse bilateral left greater than right opacities have worsened. These could be secondary to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, ARDS or infection. There is no pneumothorax or large effusions.
