An accessed right pectoral MediPort terminates in the low SVC. A right apical chest tube has been placed. A moderate right apical pneumothorax is new. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis are slightly decreased on the right following drainage. Left-sided volume loss with a band-like opacity in the left midlung are unchanged. Heart size is difficult to assess, but is likely enlarged despite the projection. The mediastinal contours are stable.
