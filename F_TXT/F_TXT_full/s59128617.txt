Since ___:55, with insertion of a right basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter, most of the previous moderate right pleural effusion has been evacuated. Small localized pneumothorax is new. Opacification in the right lower lobe could be atelectasis alone or there could be pneumonia. Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved. Left lower lobe is chronically atelectatic reflected in elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and leftward mediastinal shift. Overall lung volumes are large, due to emphysema or obstructive lung disease. Moderate cardiomegaly is underestimated as a result.
