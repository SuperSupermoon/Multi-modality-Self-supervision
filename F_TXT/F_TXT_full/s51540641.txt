Support and monitoring devices are in standard position except for a nasogastric tube terminating in the proximal stomach with side port just above the expected location of the GE junction. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for rightward patient rotation. Allowing for rotation, left lower lobe atelectasis and adjacent small left pleural effusion are not appreciably changed. No new findings have developed since the recent study of one day earlier.
