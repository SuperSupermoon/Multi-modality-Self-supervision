In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung volumes. The left hemidiaphragm is not as well seen and there is blunting of the costophrenic angle, consistent with postoperative volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. There is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting some elevated pulmonary venous pressure, though some of this may merely reflect the supine portable technique. No definite acute focal pneumonia, though this is difficult to exclude unequivocally in the absence of a lateral view.
