1. Extensive pleural thickening and pleural calcification in the right hemithorax with associated volume loss and pericardial calcification, as seen on prior chest CT, most likely the sequelae of prior pleuropericarditis. 2. Added opacity at the right lung base, which could represent additional pleural abnormality or atelectasis, though if there is concern for pnuemonia, radiographic followup is recommended. 3. Mediastinal widening, likely reflecting adenopathy seen on recent chest CT.
