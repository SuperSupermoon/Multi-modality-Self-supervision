AP chest reviewed in the absence of any recent prior chest radiographs: I see pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema extending into the deep and superficial tissues of the neck and supraclavicular region, but I see no pneumothorax. Mild edema has increased. I am looking at the left perihilar region. There is more density in the left perihilar region today than before. It could be edema, and some could be fluid in the fissure, but the finding raises concern for pneumonia. Heart is moderately big. Esophagus always has some air in it above the clavicles. A large ring shadow projecting over the cardiac silhouette, which might be due to residual gas in the hernia pouch or could be fortuitously oriented left lower lobe atelectasis. Followup is advised to exclude recurrence of gut herniation. Right lung is clear. Heart is top normal size.
