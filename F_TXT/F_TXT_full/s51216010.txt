Interval removal of right internal jugular vascular catheter sheath with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by worsening predominantly right-sided airspace opacities, potentially due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but infection in the right lung could produce a similar radiographic appearance. Marked improvement in left retrocardiac opacity consistent with decreasing effusion and atelectasis. Right pleural effusion has also decreased in size with associated slight improvement in adjacent right basilar atelectasis.
