A tracheostomy tube is in satisfactory position with the tip in the mid trachea. The lungs are hyperinflated with distortion of the pulmonary vasculature, most consistent with chronic changes of COPD. There is an opacity with air bronchograms in the retrocardiac region. Additionally, there is a focal opacity in the right lower lobe. A small left pleural effusion is present. There is no right pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. Pleural calcifications are noted. Allowing for technique, the cardiac size is at the upper limits of normal. The mediastinal contours are normal.
