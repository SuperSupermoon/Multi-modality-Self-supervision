Compared with the study from earlier on the same date, no significant change in the left apical pneumothorax without evidence of tension. Left-sided chest tube and left subclavian catheter are unchanged in position. The lungs are otherwise clear without effusion or pneumonia. Subcutaneous emphysema over the left chest wall is unchanged. Significant degenerative change at the lateral left humeral head is also unchanged.
