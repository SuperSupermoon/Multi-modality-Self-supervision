AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 10:53 a.m.: Lower lung volumes are even smaller today than earlier in the day. Moderate left pneumothorax has not increased. The pleural effusion on the left is small if any. Greater opacification at the left lung base is probably atelectasis. Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement are exaggerated by low lung volume. Subcutaneous emphysema persists in the left chest wall and the neck.
