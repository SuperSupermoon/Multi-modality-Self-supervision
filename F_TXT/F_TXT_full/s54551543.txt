Patient has been intubated with the tip of the endotracheal tube seen 5.1 cm above the carina. Bilateral predominantly perihilar alveolar opacities are again demonstrated, and are compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. Bibasilar airspace opacities persists. A feeding tube is visualized coursing through the stomach, with tip off the inferior borders of the film. A side port however is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are similar. The heart size remains mildly enlarged. No pneumothorax. Vascular calcifications are again seen in the bilateral axillary regions.
