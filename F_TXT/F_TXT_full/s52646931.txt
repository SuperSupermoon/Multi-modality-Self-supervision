Dependent pleural effusion is probably small and they are still atelectasis at the right base, with the right pigtail pleural drainage catheter unchanged in position. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Left lung is grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax. Transvenous right atrial, biventricular pacer leads are in standard positions continuous from the left pectoral generator.
