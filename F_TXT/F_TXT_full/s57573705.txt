As compared to the previous radiograph, after right lower lobectomy, there is newly appeared substantial pleural effusion. The previously partially collapsed remaining right lung shows signs of increasing collapse. The air collection in the pleura appears to have increased and now extends at the base of the right lung. The chest tube is in correct position. Unremarkable left lung. Unremarkable appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
