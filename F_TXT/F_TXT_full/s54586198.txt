AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Mild pulmonary edema now affects the right lung as well as the left. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular congestion are unchanged. The dual channel left supraclavicular central venous line has been partially withdrawn, tip is in the left brachiocephalic vein. Most proximal side port could be in the jugular vein. Patency and function should be assessed given the re-positioning. Right internal jugular line ends in the upper right atrium. An enteric tube with the wire stylet passes into the stomach and out of view. Small right pleural effusion is presumed. No pneumothorax. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
