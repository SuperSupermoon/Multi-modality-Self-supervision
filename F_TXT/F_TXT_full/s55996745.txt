Right lung is clear aside from likely small pulmonary nodules. There is considerable volume loss in the left lung attributable to left lower lobe collapse. Consolidation in the left upper lung could be due to pneumonia, particularly aspiration, or incompletely re-expanded atelectasis. Possibility of unilateral right intubation during extended surgery should be considered. Heart size is normal. Small left pleural effusion is likely. There is no right pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. There may be pneumo mediastinum, and this should be followed with conventional radiographs. Tracheostomy tube midline. Tubing projecting over the right upper chest and midline cannot be localized. Clinical correlation would be helpful.
