AP chest compared to 2:35 a.m. Feeding tube still ends in the upper stomach. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads, emanating from the left pectoral pacemaker, are in standard placements. A right subclavian remnant lead, fractured as it enters the chest, ends close to the right ventricular apex as well. No pneumothorax. Right lung base is more markedly elevated today than since ___. Some of this is due to at least a moderate subpulmonic pleural effusion, but subdiaphragmatic mass effect should be evaluated clinically. Mild pulmonary edema has improved since earlier in the day. Multifocal pulmonary infection has remained stable since ___. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion on the left is presumed but not large. Moderate cardiomegaly and distention of mediastinal veins are unchanged. A right jugular line ends just above the thoracic inlet and a dual-channel left jugular hemodialysis catheter, newly inserted, ends in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax or attendant mediastinal widening.
