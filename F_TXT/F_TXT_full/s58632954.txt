There continues to be a pigtail catheter entering the right lower chest wall, with the pigtail in the right apical pleural space. A tiny pneumothorax persists along the right apex and along the right lateral chest wall. There is no evidence of diaphragmatic flattening or mediastinal shift. Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal contours and lungs are within normal limits. There is a small amount of right sided pleural fluid.
