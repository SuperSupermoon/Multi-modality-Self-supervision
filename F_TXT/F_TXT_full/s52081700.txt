As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient position has completely unchanged. On this basis, the left hemithorax appears dense and the right hemithorax appears less dense than before. Overall; however, it is likely that the pre-existing multifocal opacities have not substantially changed. Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and moderate left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
