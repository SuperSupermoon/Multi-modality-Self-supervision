AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained on ___. The ET tube tip is approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. The NG tube is in the stomach. The temporal pacemaker lead ends in the expected location of the right ventricle. The heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance, but there is interval progression of interstitial pulmonary edema, mild to moderate with bilateral small pleural effusions. Left retrocardiac opacity might reflect effusion, although atelectasis or infection is another possibility. The left internal jugular line tip is in unchanged position, most likely at the left brachiocephalic vein/SVC junction with tip turned slightly superior.
