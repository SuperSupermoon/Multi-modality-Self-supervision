Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including cardiomegaly. There is slight interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary edema. Left retrocardiac consolidation is unchanged and might reflect developing infection or atelectasis (although the lack of volume loss would be in favor of infectious process).
