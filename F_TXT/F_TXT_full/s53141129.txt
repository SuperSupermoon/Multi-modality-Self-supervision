As compared to the previous radiograph, a pre-existing small right pleural effusion, combined with an area of parenchymal opacity, likely reflecting atelectasis, has slightly increased in extent. No other parenchymal changes are seen. Moderate cardiomegaly with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta persists. No evidence of pneumonia. No pulmonary edema.
