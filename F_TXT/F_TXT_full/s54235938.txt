In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. There is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Bilateral pleural effusions persist, more prominent on the left, with compressive basilar atelectasis. More focal area of opacification remains in the right perihilar and suprahilar region. Retrocardiac opacification again is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
