In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion. Opacification along the right lateral chest wall is again seen, as is an apparent loculated collection of pleural fluid at the upper zone laterally. Continued cardiomegaly in a patient with a dual-channel pacemaker device in place and intact midline wires following CABG. Surgical clips in the left axillary region are again seen.
