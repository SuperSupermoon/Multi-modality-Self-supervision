Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Left PICC tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC. NG tube tip is very difficult to visualize given the technique and cannot be followed below the GE junction. There is no evident pneumothorax. Diffuse left greater than right lung opacities are unchanged. Small right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions are unchanged.
