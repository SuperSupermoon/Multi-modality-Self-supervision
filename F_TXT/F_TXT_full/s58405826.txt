An external monitor traverses the mediastinum and partially obscures the left apex. Lung volumes are low, but the visualized lungs are grossly clear. The right hilus appears prominent which may be due to prominent vascularity or lymphadenopathy. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum are magnified by the projection. Incidental note is made of aortic arch calcifications.
