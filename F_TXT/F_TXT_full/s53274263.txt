In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been removed. Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is no definite vascular congestion. The upper lungs appear clear on the current study. The left hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen and there is some blunting in the costophrenic angle. This suggests small pleural effusion and mild atelectatic changes at the left base.
