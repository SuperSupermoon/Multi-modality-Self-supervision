In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with relatively mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure, raising the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. Opacification in the right mid lung is again consistent with loculated pleural effusion. If the condition of the patient permits, a lateral view would allow better definition of the pleural collection.
