Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained. The lung bases are suboptimally assessed due to lordotic positioning. The previously noted opacity in the right lower lobe is difficult to assess. Consider dedicated PA and lateral views to assess further. In addition, left lung base is poorly assessed. The mid and upper lungs appear well aerated. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Heart and mediastinal contours appear stable. Bony structures are intact.
