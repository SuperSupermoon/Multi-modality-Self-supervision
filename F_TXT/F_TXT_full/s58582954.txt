A newly placed pigtail drainage catheter projects over the right lung base. Despite this, large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis have increased from prior. There is no pneumothorax. Assessment of the cardiac silhouette is limited. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. A rounded opacity at the right lung base is likely atelectasis.
