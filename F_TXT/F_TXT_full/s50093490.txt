Right distal clavicular fracture is a partially imaged on this radiograph. Since the prior study, the endotracheal tube has been advanced, no terminating less than 3 cm from the carina. Left-sided PICC line terminates in the upper right atrium. Enteric tube terminates in the left upper quadrant, as before. Heart size is stable and retrocardiac opacification is unchanged, likely reflecting atelectasis.Small left pleural effusion is no larger than the prior radiograph.
