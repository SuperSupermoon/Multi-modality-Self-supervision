1. Left subclavian PICC line with its tip likely within the proximal to mid SVC. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. There are bilateral layering effusions, left greater than right with associated airspace opacities which likely reflect compressive atelectasis. In addition, there is worsening mild to moderate pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
