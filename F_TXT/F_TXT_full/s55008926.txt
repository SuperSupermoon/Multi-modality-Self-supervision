A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a left chest wall pacer device with the leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle. Lung volumes are low, resulting in prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Opacity at the left base likely represents atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded. There may be trace bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. No pneumothorax is seen.
