Targeted review of a chest CT from ___ referred to new consolidations/atelectasis with surrounding ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe which could represent a focus of aspiration or developing infection, as well as compression fractures of T7-T8, and new left fifth, sixth rib fractures. On the current radiograph, inspiratory volumes are low, with bibasilar atelectasis. The ground glass opacity in the RUL seen on the CT scan is not well appreciated radiographically, but could nonetheless be present. Upper zone redistribution is likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Doubt overt CHF. No gross effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly prominent, but stable. The known thoracic fractures are not well seen, but some loss of vertebral body height is noted in the mid spine.
