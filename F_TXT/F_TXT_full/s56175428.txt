Endotracheal tube tip is slightly low lying, terminating approximately 2.3 cm from the carina. Two enteric tube tips terminate within the stomach. Heart size is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution, which suggests mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Additionally, there is a persistent small right pleural effusion with adjacent right basilar opacity, which may reflect atelectasis. Left lung is grossly clear, however, the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. No large pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
