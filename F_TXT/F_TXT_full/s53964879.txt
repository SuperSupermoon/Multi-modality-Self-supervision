As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right central venous stent. The lung volumes are low. The alignment of the sternal wires is unchanged. Both lungs show relatively extensive perihilar areas of atelectasis. These changes, however, do not fulfill the typical morphological criteria for pneumonia. Standing frontal and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful to further assess the lung parenchyma. Intestinal overdistention is visible.
