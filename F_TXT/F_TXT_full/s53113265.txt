Mild pulmonary edema has worsened in the left Lung. More severe consolidation of the right lung base could be pneumonia exaggerated by the deposition of edema, or alternatively since I do not see preexisting pneumonia on ___, simply very asymmetric edema and no pneumonia. Cardiomegaly is moderate to severe. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusion is presumed, particularly on the right, but not large.
