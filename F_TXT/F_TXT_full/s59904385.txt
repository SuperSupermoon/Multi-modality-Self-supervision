In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a left chest tube remains in place with side-port external to the pleural space within the adjacent soft tissues of the lateral chest wall. Small left apical pneumothorax is a persistent finding as well as a loculated pleural fluid collection just below the site of chest tube entry. Note is made of slight improved aeration in the left retrocardiac region and decrease in extent of subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall, as well as apparent decrease in size of a moderate right pleural effusion. No other relevant change.
