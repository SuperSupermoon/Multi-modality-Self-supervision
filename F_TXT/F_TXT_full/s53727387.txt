AP chest compared to ___. Opacification in the right lower hemithorax is new. Since it is traversed by air bronchograms, I think it more likely consolidation in the middle or lower lobe than pleural effusion, and as such possible pneumonia. Two left-sided drainage tubes project over the cardiac silhouette and left lower hemithorax, terminating at the level of the left hilus, but impossible to localize on a single frontal view. The volume of the heart shadow is not much changed although the shape is different, and this could represent pericardial drainage. There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard placement.
