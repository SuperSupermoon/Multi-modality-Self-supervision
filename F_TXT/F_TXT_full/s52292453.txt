Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval development of large left pneumothorax with no significant mediastinal shift or signs of tension. An endotracheal tube terminates 6.8 cm above the level of the carina. An esophageal tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view. Widespread right lung parenchymal opacities persist, consistent with ARDS. Cystic and linear lucencies in the right lung are likely due to pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE). There is gaseous distension of the stomach.
