As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The lung volumes have slightly decreased and there is a new zone of parenchymal opacity at the left lung bases. In the appropriate clinical setting, this change could reflect pneumonia. No other relevant changes are noted. They opacity in the right upper lobe is constant in severity in extent.
