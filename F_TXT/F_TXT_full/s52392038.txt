The inspiratory lung volumes are low. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is accentuated due to low lung volumes. There is resultant bronchovascular crowding, but no overt pulmonary edema. No evidence of free air beneath the diaphragms is seen. Residual contrast is seen in the renal collecting systems which appears dilated on the right.
