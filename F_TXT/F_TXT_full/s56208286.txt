Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is accentuated by the projection. Right upper lobe consolidation has increased, worrisome for worsening probably pneumonia. Otherwise, diffuse bilateral lung opacities, right greater than left, are grossly unchanged, partially due to a component of pulmonary edema. ARDS cannot be excluded. Presumed moderate right pleural effusion and small left effusion are unchanged. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube is out of view below the diaphragm. Right PICC tip is in unchanged position, probably in the left brachiocephalic vein.
