The ET tube terminates approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. Enteric tube traverses below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film. The bases of the lungs demonstrate mild atelectasis otherwise no focal consolidations, pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are seen. Heart size is normal. Apparent widening of the mediastinum is secondary to mediastinal fat as seen on the CT. Note is made of a subtle nondisplaced fracture of the right lateral 5th rib, better evaluated on the recent CT.
