There are relatively low lung volumes and persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Reticular opacities at the lung bases correspond to chronic interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis as seen on prior studies including PET-CT from ___ however, relative airspace opacities projecting at the left lower lung in bilateral perihilar regions could be due to infection and/or pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
