Given differences in positioning, the moderate-sized bilateral effusions with associated bibasilar airspace opacities favoring atelectasis are likely not significantly changed. However, there has been interval appearance of mild perihilar and interstitial edema. The more rounded opacity in the left mid lung is stable. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged but somewhat difficult to assess due to the pleural effusions.
