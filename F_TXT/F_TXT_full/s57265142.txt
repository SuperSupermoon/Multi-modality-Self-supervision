There has been interval placement of a pigtail catheter in the left upper chest with significant interval decrease in size of left pneumothorax, now small at the left upper hemi thorax. Extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities due to known severe interstitial fibrosis are re- demonstrated. Superimposed pulmonary edema may be present. There may be new left mid lung atelectasis/re-expansion atelectasis.
