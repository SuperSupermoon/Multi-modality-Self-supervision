As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. No evidence of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, parenchymal opacity or decrease in vascularity of the lungs that would suggest the presence of PE. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Minimal apical scarring bilaterally that is unchanged since the prior image. If clinical suspicion of PE persists, however, CT angiography of the thorax should be performed, given the substantially higher sensitivity of this technique.
