Interval increase in opacification of the left hemithorax with only a small amount of residual aerated lung in the left upper lobe. This appears to be due to a combination of partial left lung collapse and enlarging left pleural effusion which appears partially loculated. These findings were communicated by phone with Dr. ___ ___:30 a.m. on ___ at time of discovery. Small right pleural effusion and adjacent basilar atelectasis are unchanged.
