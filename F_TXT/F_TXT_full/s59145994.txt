All of the pulmonary findings could be explained by a moderately severe pulmonary edema and small pleural effusions, both worsened since ___, and new since ___. However there is also a roughly 3.5 cm wide right infrahilar opacity which could be pneumonia or a lung mass,, presumably abscess because it was not present or much smaller on ___. It needs to be followed radiographically, particularly edema improves. Moderate cardiomegaly stable. Small bilateral pleural effusions have increased.
