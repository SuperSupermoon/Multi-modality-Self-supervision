No new central venous line is seen in the chest since the prior study from earlier today, ___ at 14:26. Large bore dual-lumen catheter on the right is stable in position. Partially imaged catheter is seen extending into the left upper quadrant, similar to prior. Bilateral pleural effusions are re- demonstrated, left greater than right, with overlying atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema persists. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain stable with the cardiac silhouette quite enlarged.
