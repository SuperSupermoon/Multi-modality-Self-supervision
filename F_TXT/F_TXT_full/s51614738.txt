In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube has been pulled back so that the tip now lies approximately 2.2 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends at least to the lower body of the stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the image. There are lower lung volumes. Diffuse prominence of interstitial markings reflects a combination of interstitial fibrosis and pulmonary edema.
