AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. There is right subcutaneous air that appears to be overall unchanged. Multiple rib fractures are redemonstrated. There is no clearly seen right pneumothorax on the current examination, but there is substantial progression of the right mid and lower lung consolidations. Minimal left basal consolidation is noted as well. The pneumothorax seen on the prior chest CT obtained the day before can be potentially obscured by the subcutaneous air, thus cannot be entirely excluded.
