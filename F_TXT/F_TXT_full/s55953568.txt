Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The mediastinal contour is similar. A moderate layering left pleural effusion likely accounts for the left perihilar haziness. Dense retrocardiac opacification could reflect compressive atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. Right lung is grossly clear without right-sided pleural effusion. No definite pulmonary edema is demonstrated. No pneumothorax is present. Multiple clips project over the epigastric region. Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
