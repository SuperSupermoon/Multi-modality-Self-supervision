An ET tube terminates 3 cm above the carina. And NG tube passes inferiorly off the image in the expected region of the stomach. The lungs are well expanded. Diffusely increased interstitial markings are again seen, along with engorged pulmonary vasculature and cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. Increased opacity at the left lung base compared to prior likely reflects atelectasis. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no pneumothorax.
