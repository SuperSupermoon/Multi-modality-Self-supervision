A single supine portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating in the cavoatrial junction. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The lung volumes are low, causing crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. The heart size is likely top normal in size and the mediastinal silhouette is within normal limits, allowing for supine portable technique and rotation. Bibasilar atelectasis is present. There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. No large pleural effusion or overt pulmonary edema is identified. Left apical pleural thickening is noted.
