The heart appears mildly enlarged. There is a dense retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms, suggesting pneumonia. There are also more patchy streaky right basilar opacities. In addition, central pulmonary arteries are mildly prominent with upper zone redistribution, suggestive of mild fluid overload. Small pleural effusions are difficult to exclude. There is no pneumothorax. The bones are probably demineralized. There is mild leftward convex curvature centered along the mid lumbar spine.
