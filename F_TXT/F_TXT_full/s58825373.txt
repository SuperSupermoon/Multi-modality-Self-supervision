Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion has increased. Right lower lobe opacity has worsened, consistent with almost complete collapse of the right lower lobe. Small right pleural effusion is probably unchanged. Cardiac size is obscured by left pleuroparenchymal abnormalities. There are low lung volumes. Right PICC tip is not well visualized but appears to be in the low SVC. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
