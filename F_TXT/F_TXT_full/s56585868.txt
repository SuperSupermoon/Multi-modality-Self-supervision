AP chest compared to ___ at 8:53 a.m.: No pneumothorax or change in small to moderate right pleural effusion. I believe a drainage catheter still in place at the base of the right hemithorax. Extent of opacification in the right lung has improved since ___ when there was severe atelectasis and then edema. There is no residual pneumothorax. A large right suprahilar mass, and smaller right lung nodules are still present. Left hemidiaphragm is elevated, perhaps by distention of subdiaphragmatic GI tract. Heart is top normal size.
