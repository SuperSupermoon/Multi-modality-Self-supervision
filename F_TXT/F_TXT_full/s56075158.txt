Despite the history of extubation, an endotracheal tube is present and terminates 1.7 cm above the carina. An enteric tube ends in the esophagus and would need to be advanced at least 10cm to move all the sideports into the stomach. A left subclavian catheter tip terminates in the mid superior vena cava. Orthopedic hardware and a vascular abdominal stent are noted. The lung volumes are low which results in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is prominence of the central vasculature without overt evidence for pulmonary edema. A rounded opacity is seen at the right lung base and is new. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac size in normal. Apparent widening of the mediastinum is unchanged. Dilated air-filled loops of large bowel below the diaphragm. No free air seen on this supine only view.
