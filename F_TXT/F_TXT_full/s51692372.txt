Slightly rotated positioning. Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates slightly low lung volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are unchanged since the prior examination, with mild to moderate cardiomegaly and slight unfolding of the aorta again noted. Increased right paramediastinal density immediately below the right clavicular head likely represents artifact due to patient obliquity. No CHF. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Equivocal tiny right sided effusion. No obvious focal infiltrate and no focal consolidation is identified.
