AP chest compared to ___: Edema has improved substantially on the right, along with decrease in previous moderate right pleural effusion, now small. However, there is worsening of perihilar consolidation in the left lung, presumably dependent edema. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable. There is at least some left pleural effusion, and no evidence of pneumothorax.
