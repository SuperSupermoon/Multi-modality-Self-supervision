A Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the elongated tip in the gastric fundus, which could be advanced further into the stomach. A tracheostomy is in place. A right PICC line is repositioned now with the tip terminating in the mid-to-low SVC. Opacification of the bilateral bases greater on the left than the right is minimally increased from the most recent prior study compatible with small pleural effusions and atelectasis. Diaphragmatic calcifications and pleural calcified plaques are again noted consistent with asbestos exposure. The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The pulmonary vasculature appears engorged but stable.
