The lung volumes remain low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, although it is difficult to resolve the cardiac contour. There is a new perihilar fullness, upper zone re-distribution, and hazy opacity suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion. In addition, the left hemidiaphragm is more obscured suggesting that possibly there is a developing left lower lobe or lingular process. There is no pneumothorax.
