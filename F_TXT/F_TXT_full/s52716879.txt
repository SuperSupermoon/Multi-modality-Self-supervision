1 hr prior to this examination, the patient underwent CT-guided biopsy of the left lobe pulmonary nodule with a trace medial left pneumothorax on post procedure images. No pneumothorax is evident on this examination. Heart size and mediastinal contours appear within normal limits. Diffuse opacity throughout the lungs is consistent with known nodular pulmonary disease. In addition, superimposed nodular densities correspond to macroscopic nodules seen previously at CT. There is no pleural effusion. Osseous structures appear unchanged.
