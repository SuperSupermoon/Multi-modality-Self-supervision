Low lung volumes cause bronchovascular crowding and bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis. Indistinct airspace opacities in the right lung base may represent atelectasis related to low lung volumes or early focal consolidation. There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, or displaced rib fracture. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
