As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen in extent of the known right basal pneumothorax and of the consolidation at the right lung base. Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. The right PICC line continues to project over the right atrium. The line should be pulled back by 2-3 cm if it should lie at the cavoatrial junction.
