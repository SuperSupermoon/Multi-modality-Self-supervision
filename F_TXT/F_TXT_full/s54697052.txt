As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal decrease in severity of the pre-existing evidence for pulmonary edema. However, fluid overload is still clearly visible. The pre-existing pleural effusions have decreased in extent. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged and the shape of the heart could suggest coexisting pericardial effusion. Echocardiography could be helpful. No pneumothorax. No pneumonia.
