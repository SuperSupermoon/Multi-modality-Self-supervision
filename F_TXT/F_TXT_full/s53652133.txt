Low lung volumes are again demonstrated. Chronic interstitial abnormality is again seen as well as more focal opacities within the left lung base, left perihilar region, and right upper lobe which are not significantly changed when compared to the prior exam. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged with marked calcification of the aortic knob. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is demonstrated. The right PICC has been removed. Assessment of the pulmonary vascularity is limited.
