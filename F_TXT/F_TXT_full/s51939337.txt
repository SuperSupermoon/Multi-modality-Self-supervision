No comparison. The lung volumes are normal. No pleural effusions. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. There is mild widening of the mediastinum, likely at the level of the paravertebral soft tissues. The lateral radiograph should be obtained, potentially followed by CT, to exclude the presence of a mediastinal mass.
