AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is new. Exacerbation at the base of the right lung may be due to asymmetric deposition of edema due to the persistent elevation of the right lung base and poor aeration in the lower lobes. The elevation of the right lung base is primarily due to a large chronic right pleural effusion. The elevated and enlarged right hilus, adjacent radiation fibrosis and apical pleural thickening are chronic. A second region of more focal edema in the right upper lobe sitting on the minor fissure is probably due to disturbed lymphatic drainage from the radiated lung. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Small size of nodules in the left lung on chest CTA yesterday, I am surprised at the prominence of such nodules today in the mid lung. It would be prudent to repeat this chest radiograph later in the day to exclude the development of nodular infection. Dr. ___ was paged at 9 a.m. when the findings were realized.
