There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. There is a new opacity at the right lung base which may be asymmetric vascular congestion versus pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Significantly increased size of the cardiac silhouette may partly be due to AP, supine, and lordotic positioning and cardiomegaly in the setting of heart failure however a pericardial effusion may be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
