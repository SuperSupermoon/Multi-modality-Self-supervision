A tiny right apical pneumothorax has decreased in size since the recent chest radiograph. Left chest tube remains in place, with no visible left pneumothorax. Continued improving consolidation in lingula and left lower lobe, probably a combination of contusion and atelectasis in this patient with multiple left rib fractures. Previously present patchy opacity at right base has decreased, with otherwise clear right lung. Left clavicle scapular fracture is again visualized as well as extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall.
