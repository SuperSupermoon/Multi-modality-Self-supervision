Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate slight interval improvement in the right basilar pneumothorax since previous imaging. The rest of the chest radiograph is essentially unchanged from prior imaging. The right basilar opacity is unchanged. The left-sided pleural effusion has not changed since prior imaging. There is no right-sided pleural effusion. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Again seen is the SVC stent, femoral central line with tip in the right atrium, and pigtail catheter at the right lung base.
