Lung volumes are low, which accentuates bronchovascular markings. Subtle bibasilar opacities are not significantly changed, and compatible with known NSIP. There is no new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No overt pulmonary edema. Accounting for portal technique, cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. No acute osseous abnormalities are identified. The Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position with distal tip in the right atrium. Surgical clips are seen within the right axilla.
