Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates well expanded, clear lungs. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation. A pacemaker device is present, with leads terminating in the locations of the right atrium and right ventricle. Again seen is anterior and inferior dislocation of the right humeral head with respect to the glenoid, and fracture through the greater tubercle of the right humerus.
