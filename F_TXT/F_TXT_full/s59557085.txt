Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a left pectoral cardiac pacer with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. The heart is top normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There are increased perihilar streaky opacities, which suggests pulmonary edema. Right suprahilar pulmonary mass is redemonstrated, better correlated on cross-sectional imaging. There is dense retrocardiac probable atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
