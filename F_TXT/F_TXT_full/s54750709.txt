Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The heart remains enlarged, which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. There are likely bilateral layering effusions. Patchy bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. There is cephalization of the vasculature which could be positional, but does raise concern for pulmonary venous hypertension. No overt pulmonary edema is evident. Spinal rods overlying the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine, obscuring detail. There has been a median sternotomy for CABG.
