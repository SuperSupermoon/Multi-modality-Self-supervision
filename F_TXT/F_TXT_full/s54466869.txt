Comparison is made with prior study ___. Widened mediastinum, enlarged pulmonary arteries and moderate cardiomegaly are unchanged. Improved left lower lobe opacities are consistent with improving atelectasis and pleural effusion. Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved. Mild pulmonary edema is grossly unchanged.
