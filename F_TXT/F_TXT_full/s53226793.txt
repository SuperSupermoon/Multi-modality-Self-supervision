As compared to the previous radiograph, the partial right upper lobe collapse has substantially improved. However, there are some remnant minimal opacities in the right upper lobe, probably of atelectatic origin. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and marked hilar enlargements. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube are constant.
