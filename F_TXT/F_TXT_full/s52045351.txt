Compared to the most recent exam, no significant change. Bilateral atelectasis and pleural effusion, right worse than left is seen. There is loculated small amount pleural air at the right base beneath the right lung, likely from pleural restriction. The right lung is not well expanded likely due to thickened pleura. Heart size is difficult to determine due to thickened pleura, though not significantly changed. Bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged. There are 2 chest tubes in the right chest. There is apparent change in the upper chest tube position compared to the prior, with the most proximal port in the intercostal space, previously intrathoracic.
