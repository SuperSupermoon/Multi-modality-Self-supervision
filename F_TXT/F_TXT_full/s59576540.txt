As compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, a left chest tube remains in place with near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax. A vertically oriented lucency lateral to the chest tube persists, and a rounded area of lucency adjacent to the left hilum has increased in the interval. Observed findings are consistent with postoperative left lower lobe collapse in this patient status post left upper lobe resection. Coexisting left pleural effusion is likely but difficult to quantify.
