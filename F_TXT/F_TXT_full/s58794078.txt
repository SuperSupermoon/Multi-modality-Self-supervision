There are new small bilateral pleural effusions as compared to ___ with overlying atelectasis. A retrocardiac opacity is presumably atelectasis, however, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There is prominence of the central venous vasculature without overt evidence for pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The heart is top normal in size. Extensive calcifications are seen within the aortic valve anulus, unchanged. There is kyphoplasty material in the upper lumbar spine.
