In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the image. Continued diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, worse on the right. This again could reflect some combination of progressive edema and infection. No definite pleural effusion.
