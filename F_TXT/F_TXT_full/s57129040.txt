Portable chest radiograph demonstrates multifocal opacities within the left mid and lower lung zones with associated left pleural effusion. There is additional small right-sided pleural effusion. The right lung is grossly clear without a focal consolidation. There is increased density within bilateral lungs as well as increased diameter of pulmonary vasculature, including hilar structures. These findings are consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema. The heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax. Apical right pleural thickening is noted.
