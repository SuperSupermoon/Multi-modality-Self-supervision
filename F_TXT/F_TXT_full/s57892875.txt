Heart size and mediastinum are overall unremarkable. Lung volumes are very low. There is no pulmonary edema. Minimal bibasal atelectasis is noted and potentially left pleural effusion. Overall no findings definitely explaining that she cardiac demonstrated. If clinically warranted, correlation with CT chest preferably after administration of IV contrast is to be considered.
