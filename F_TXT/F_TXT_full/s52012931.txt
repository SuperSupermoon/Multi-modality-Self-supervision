A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a tracheostomy, unchanged in position. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate secondary to opacity in the bilateral lung bases, but appears increased in size. Bilateral diffuse opacities are increased. Bilateral pleural effusions are increased. There is no pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
