Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected position of the right atrium and right ventricle, although the very inferior aspect of the right ventricular lead is not fully included on the image. Moderate cardiac silhouette enlargement persists. Mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement is again seen. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. Mediastinal contours are stable.
