Lung volumes are slightly low with left lower lobe atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Even allowing for the projection, the heart size is mildly enlarged and there is prominence of the bilateral hila consistent with mild congestive heart failure. No definite pleural effusion. No pneumothorax seen.
