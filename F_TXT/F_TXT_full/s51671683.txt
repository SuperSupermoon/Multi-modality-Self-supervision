ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carinal. Tip pacemaker lead terminates in the right ventricle. There is a left mediastinal shift is more pronounced on the prior study consistent with a left lower lung atelectasis. The retrocardiac opacity on the left is corresponding to the finding that there is also 6 seen on the chest CT from ___. Pneumothorax demonstrated on the chest CT is not clearly seen on the current radiograph that can potentially be due to its resolution or superimposed apical opacities. The lung is well expanded with basal opacities. The multifocal opacities might in fact represent widespread infectious process especially giving the appearance on the recent chest CT.
