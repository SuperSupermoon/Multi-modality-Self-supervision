Lung volumes are low which results in limited evaluation of the lung bases. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. Heart size is unchanged and within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar, with prominence of the pulmonary artery suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension as noted previously. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
