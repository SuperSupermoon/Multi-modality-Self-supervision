Lung volumes are within normal limits. Even allowing for the projection, the heart is mildly enlarged and there is mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, particular in the upper lobes consistent with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No frank pulmonary edema seen. No consolidation or pneumothorax seen. No pleural effusion seen. There is a relatively acute scoliotic curve convex the right centered at the thorax lumbar junction, there may be a compression deformity at this level, this is incompletely evaluated on this AP view only. Degenerative changes in the left shoulder.
