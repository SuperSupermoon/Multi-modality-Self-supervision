Compared with the prior film, an OG type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off the inferior edge of the film. ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. The right IJ central line tip overlies the distal SVC. No pneumothorax detected. Note is made of slight pleural thickening at the left lung apex, similar to the prior film There are low inspiratory volumes. Cardiac silhouette unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, with mild blurring, suggesting mild CHF. However, this appearance is likely accentuated to some degree by the low lung volumes . Again seen is patchy increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. No effusion. The upper portion of the patient's IVC filter is noted.
