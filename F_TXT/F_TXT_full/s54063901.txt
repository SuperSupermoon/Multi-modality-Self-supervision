AP chest compared to ___: Moderate right pneumothorax, no smaller and possibly larger today than it was on ___, despite right pleural tube. Orientation of the pleural tube is consistent with but not diagnostic of fissural placement. The lower pleural tube is unchanged in position at the base of the right hemithorax, largely in the air-filled pleural space. Small left pleural effusion is new. Interval increase in heart size and mediastinal vascular caliber suggests increased intravascular volume. Dr. ___ was paged at 12:00 noon as soon as the findings were recognized.
