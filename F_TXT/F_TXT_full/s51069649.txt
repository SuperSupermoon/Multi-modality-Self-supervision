In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is no definite pneumoperitoneum or pneumothorax. Streak of atelectasis is seen at the right base. Opacification at the left base again is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural fluid. No substantial change in the appearance of the neo esophagus.
