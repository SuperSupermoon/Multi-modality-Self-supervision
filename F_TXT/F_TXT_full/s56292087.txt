AP portable supine view of the chest. An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing 4.6 cm above the carinal. A nasogastric tube is seen terminating in the proximal stomach, with the distal side port in the distal esophagus. There is mild pulmonary congestion without overt edema. No supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal contour is prominent likely secondary to technique. Bony structures are intact.
