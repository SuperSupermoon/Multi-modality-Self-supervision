Endotracheal tube, dual-chamber pacemaker and a left PICC line are in satisfactory position. Enteric tube terminates in the distal esophagus and should be advanced by at least 10 cm for better positioning beyond the gastroesophageal junction.Lungs are again hyperinflated with bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Opacification of the retrocardiac region represents left lower lobe atelectasis. Increased opacification of the right lung base may represent developing pneumonia.
