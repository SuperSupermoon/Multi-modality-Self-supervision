Slight interval improvement in patchy opacity at medial right lung base otherwise, no significant interval change. Again seen is patchy retrocardiac opacity with lateralization of the left hemidiaphragm, compatible with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion. Hazy opacity at the right lung base laterally could reflect a small right effusion. There is upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora compatible with CHF. No new infiltrate identified. The ET tube tip lies 3.5 cm above the carina. NG tube tip extends beneath the diaphragm, off film. Again seen is a right IJ line, tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax detected.
