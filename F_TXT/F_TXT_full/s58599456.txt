AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Mild pulmonary edema and mediastinal and pulmonary vascular congestion present on ___ had improved by ___ and have now substantially cleared. Severe cardiomegaly and large mediastinal vasculature are chronic findings. Lung bases are partially obscured, and their evaluation would be helped by a lateral view, but I doubt that there is collapse or substantial pleural effusion on either side. This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus, even to a substantial extent.
