As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube is now well visible, but the tip is not included on the image. The course of the tube is unremarkable. The patient is still intubated. The image shows signs of moderate pulmonary edema, combined to a mild left pleural effusion and subsequent atelectasis. The size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be slightly enlarged.
