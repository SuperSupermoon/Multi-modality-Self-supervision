Comparison is made to previous study from ___. Median sternotomy wires are again seen. There is mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings at the right base consistent with atelectasis. No definite consolidation is seen. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema. There is likely a small right-sided pleural effusion.
