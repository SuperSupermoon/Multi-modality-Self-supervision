AP chest compared to ___:52 a.m.: Enteric tube ends barely in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced 5 cm to be sure that all of the side ports are beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Cardiomegaly is mild and unchanged. There is no longer any pulmonary edema, but mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
