AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 11 hours earlier during the same day. Chest findings are grossly unaltered. Noted is, however, the placement of a NG tube of Dobbhoff type, the tip of which has passed the diaphragm and reaches the fundus portion of the stomach. No gross interval changes of the chest findings in comparison with the previous study.
