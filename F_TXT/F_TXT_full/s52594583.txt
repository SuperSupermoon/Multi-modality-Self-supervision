A left chest wall dual-lead pacemaker remains with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle in unchanged position. Dense opacification of the left lung base with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and the left cardiac contour is likely a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. There is no large right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Increased interstitial markings are consistent with pulmonary edema. Heavy calcification of the aortic knob is again noted. A vascular stent is noted projecting over the right axilla.
