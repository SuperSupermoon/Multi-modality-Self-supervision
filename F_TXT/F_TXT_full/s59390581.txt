There is no pneumothorax effusion or CHF. The left retrocardiac consolidation seen on the CT scan is less well visualized on this AP film. We have no lateral film for additional localization. There are a few faint small densities bilaterally and a dedicated chest CT would be recommended if this would aid in therapy planning.
