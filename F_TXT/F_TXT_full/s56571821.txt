Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged, though there is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Clips are seen within the left breast and axilla. No acute osseous abnormalities are identified.
