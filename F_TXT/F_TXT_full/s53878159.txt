Right basilar pleural pigtail catheter remains in place. There is a tiny right apical pneumothorax. The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable. A left-sided pacer remains in place. There is patchy opacity at the right base which may reflect re-expansion pulmonary edema, although patchy ateclectasis or pneumonia should also be considered. A rounded contour to the right medial lung base may reflect prominent epicardial fat when correlated with abdominal CT studies from ___ and ___, although a medial lung nodule cannot be entirely excluded. This can be re-assessed on followup imaging. No large effusions.
