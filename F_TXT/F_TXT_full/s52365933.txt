Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has increased due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. Lateral view would be helpful in assessing the volume of pleural effusion if any, but small pleural effusions could be present. Vascular deficiency in the upper lungs is due to emphysema. Greater opacification at the lung bases could be due to vascular congestion of heart failure, or perhaps peribronchial infiltration due to aspiration or early pneumonia.
