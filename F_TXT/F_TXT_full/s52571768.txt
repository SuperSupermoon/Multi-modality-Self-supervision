There has been interval removal of right-sided chest tube. The previously seen right apical pneumothorax is reduced in size. There are stable moderately low lung volumes with pleural effusion, essentially unchanged. There is stable cardiomegaly. Swan-Ganz catheter now terminates within the right main pulmonary artery. Endotracheal tube is again seen in place, unchanged in position no less than 3 cm from the carina.
