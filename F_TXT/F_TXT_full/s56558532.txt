AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained 14 hours earlier during the same day. During the examination interval, all the left-sided chest tube has been removed. No evidence of pneumothorax in the left apical area and the lung fields are clear. The patient remains intubated with the ETT in unchanged position. Also, the NG tube remains. The same holds for the right-sided chest tube terminating close to the superior mediastinum in the right apical area. No new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are seen and the lateral pleural sinuses remain free.
