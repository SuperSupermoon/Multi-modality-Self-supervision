Right pleural catheter remains in place, with persistent small right pleural effusion and adjacent worsening right basilar atelectasis as compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier. Left basilar atelectasis and small left pleural effusion have also worsened in the interval. Multiple posttraumatic deformities are again demonstrated, and there are no additional relevant findings compared to the recent study.
