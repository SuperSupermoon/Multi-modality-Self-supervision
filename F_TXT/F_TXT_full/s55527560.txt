AP chest compared to ___, 10:12 p.m.: Large right pneumothorax has increased substantially despite placement of a right pigtail pleural drain at the base of the right hemithorax. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is slightly less severe now than it was earlier. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable but moderate pulmonary edema has improved. This might be an indirect sign of decreased venous return suggesting that the right pneumothorax is hemodynamically significant even though the mediastinum has not shifted. ET tube is in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. Findings were discussed with report of subsequent radiograph available at the time of this review.
