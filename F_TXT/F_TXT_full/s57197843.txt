In comparison to prior radiograph from earlier the same date, bilateral asymmetrically distributed alveolar opacities demonstrate a mixed response, with overall worsening in the left upper lobe and right lower lobe, and improvement in the right upper and left lower lobes. Such rapid fluctuations favor pulmonary edema as the most likely etiology although coexisting aspiration or pneumonia are possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Small to moderate right pleural effusion has increased in size in the interval. No other relevant change.
