Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval worsening of right parenchymal opacities, which may be due to pulmonary edema, atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Left moderate and small right pleural effusions are unchanged. No pneumothorax. Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette. The right PICC, ET tube, and enteric tube are unchanged in position. Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
