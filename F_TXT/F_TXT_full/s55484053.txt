A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a tracheostomy, with the tip in the mid thoracic trachea. There is mild cardiomegaly, possibly accentuated by low lung volumes and patient positioning. There is bibasilar atelectasis, without identification of a definite focal consolidation. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
