Radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessment of a nasogastric tube, which extends at least into the distal stomach. Pre-existing feeding tube remains coiled in the stomach with distal tip directed towards the GE junction. Assessment of the thorax is limited due to marked patient rotation. There has been apparent repositioning of an intra-aortic balloon pump, now terminating 5.9 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. This could be advanced a few centimeters for standard positioning. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Persistent interstitial edema as well as a confluent left perihilar opacity which ___ reflect asymmetrical edema or potentially a secondary process such as aspiration or infection. Left retrocardiac opacity has apparently slightly improved but is difficult to assess on this rotated study.
