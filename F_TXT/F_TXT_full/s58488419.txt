AP chest compared to ___ at 4:40 p.m.: Left lung is clear. There is heterogeneous opacification in the right lower lung that could be recent aspiration and should be followed to detect any developing pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Patient has had right thoracotomy and partial rib resection, so the volume loss reflected in relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm may not be acute. ET tube is in standard placement. An upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach but would need to be advanced at least 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
