Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. Chronic collapse of the right upper lobe and severe multi focal bronchiectasis and scarring is stable. Opacity in the left upper lobe represents engorged vessels and worsening of bronchial impaction. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Small left-sided pleural effusion is new. No pneumothorax. The ICD is in the appropriate position with leads seen in the right atrium and right ventricle. The right-sided Port-A-Cath ends in the right atrium.
