Single portable view of the chest. Endotracheal tube is seen with tip 3.8 cm from the carina. NG tube seen with tip just past the GE junction and should be advanced. Relatively low lung volumes are noted. There is left basilar opacity which silhouettes the hemidiaphragm potentially due to atelectasis with possible area effusion or consolidation also possible. The right lung is grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
