Tracheostomy and Port-A-Cath appears stable in position. Left-sided pleural effusion appears minimally increased in comparison to prior study with increasing atelectasis/consolidation in the left lower lobe. Persistent right small pleural effusion is stable. Mild right basilar atelectasis has minimally improved. Mild pumonary edema is stable. Prominence of the anterior mediastinum is again noted and consistent with hematoma.
