As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of a normal cardiac silhouette with moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, now with plate-like atelectasis at the right lung bases. Otherwise, the lung parenchyma appears normal. There is no evidence of acute changes such as pulmonary edema, pneumonia or pleural effusion. Normal hilar and mediastinal structures.
