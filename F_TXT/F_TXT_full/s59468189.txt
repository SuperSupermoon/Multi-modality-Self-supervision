As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the endotracheal tube, are in unchanged position. There is a new minimal right pleural effusion with subsequent atelectasis at the right lung base. The size of the cardiac silhouette remains large, but no overt pulmonary edema is present. No other relevant changes. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina on today's examination.
