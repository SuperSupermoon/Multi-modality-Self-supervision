As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new nasogastric tube. The other monitoring and support devices, including the right pleural pigtail catheter are in unchanged position. The pigtail catheter shows several areas of kinking along its course. The extent of the right pleural fluid collection is without relevant change. Areas of atelectasis at the left lung bases have slightly increased in extent and severity.
