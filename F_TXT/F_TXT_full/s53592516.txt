Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Heart size is enlarged as well as there is substantial enlargement of pulmonary artery that might be consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Those findings were noted on the CT torso where the main pulmonary artery was demonstrated to be 4 cm in diameter, substantially larger than aorta. Bibasal opacities are minimal, most likely reflecting atelectasis with no evidence of pulmonary edema or consolidations to suggest infectious process. Right PICC line tip is at the level of mid-low SVC.
