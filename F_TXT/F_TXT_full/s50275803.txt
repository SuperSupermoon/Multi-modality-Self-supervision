Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates a left internal jugular central venous catheter, terminating in the upper SVC. A right dual-lumen hemodialysis catheter is unchanged, terminating at the cavoatrial junction. The lungs are well expanded and clear. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace opacity. The heart is mildly enlarged. Otherwise, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
