The patient is status post median sternotomy with multiple metallic closure devices seen. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged with overlying streaky linear opacities compatible with bibasilar atelectasis. Streaky opacities at the left lung base are also similar in appearance to the prior study, compatible with atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this single frontal view. There is no overt pulmonary edema. The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size, but stable. The thoracic aorta is tortuous and partially calcified, as before. There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
