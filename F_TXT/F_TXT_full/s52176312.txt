AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature mildly engorged but the heart is not enlarged. Opacification at both lung bases is probably moderately severe atelectasis. Upper lungs are clear. Heart size normal. Right PIC line ends in the mid-to-low SVC.
