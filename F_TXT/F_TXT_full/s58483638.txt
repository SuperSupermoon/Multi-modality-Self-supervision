CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. A left subclavian PICC line is present, tip over proximal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Compared with ___ at 23:35 p.m. and allowing for differences in technique, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen are opacities at both lung bases, slightly more pronounced at the left base. Also again seen is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. No gross effusion.
