In comparison with the study of 10 9 from an outside facility, there is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with indistinct and engorged pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The hemidiaphragms are not well seen bilaterally, consistent with layering effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases, more prominent on the left.
