The ET tube terminates approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. There is an enteric tube which courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of view from this radiograph. The heart is again severely enlarged overall stable compared to the prior exam. The massively enlarged triangular cardiac silhouette appears overall unchanged compared to the prior radiograph in morphology. There appears to be slight interval improvement in the opacification over the right lung suggestive of mild interval improvement of the large right pleural effusion. The left lung base consolidation appears to be stable compared to the prior exam. The small left pleural effusion is unchanged. The degree of bilateral pulmonary edema is constant. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
