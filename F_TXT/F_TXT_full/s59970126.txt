Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Patchy opacities in the lung bases are re- demonstrated along with a more consolidative opacity within the right upper lobe, findings worrisome for multifocal pneumonia. Previously demonstrated suspicious nodule within the left mid lung field is better assessed on the previous CT. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary vascular congestion is demonstrated. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
