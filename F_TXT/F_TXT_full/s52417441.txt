Again seen is a left IJ central line with tip over proximal SVC . Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. There is hyperinflation, suggesting COPD.

No definite consolidation. No gross effusion. Possible focal mild pleural thickening of the lower left lung base, which is unchanged compared with ___.
