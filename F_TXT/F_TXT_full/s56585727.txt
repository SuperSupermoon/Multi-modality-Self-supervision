there is dense retrocardiac opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. There is also increased opacity at the right base compatible with an infiltrate in that region. Tracheostomy tube is again seen. Compared to the prior study the amount of volume loss or infiltrate at both bases has slightly increased. The right effusion is slightly decreased. The right central line is no longer visualized.
