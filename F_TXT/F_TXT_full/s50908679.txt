Comparison is made with prior study ___. NG tube tip is coiled in the stomach. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. There are persistent low lung volumes with increasing atelectasis, more so on the right. Mediastinal and chest tubes remain in place. Peripheral opacities in the left lung are again noted, mainly in the upper lung, improved from prior study. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or large effusion.
