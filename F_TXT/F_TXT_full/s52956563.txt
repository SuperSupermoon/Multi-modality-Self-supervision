In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there appears to be some increased engorgement of pulmonary vessels consistent with worsening pulmonary venous pressure. The left hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen. This suggests the possibility of atelectasis and effusion, though supervening consolidation cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Extensive mitral annular calcification is again seen.
