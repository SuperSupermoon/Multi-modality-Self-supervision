As compared to chest radiograph from 1 day prior, interval decrease in lung volumes. This decreased may account for the more kinked lower appearance of the right pigtail catheter. Multiloculated pleural effusion has not substantially changed. Known loculated fluid along the fissure and surrounding likely pneumonia has not substantially changed given for differences in technique. Left-sided pleural fluid/thickening slightly increased.
