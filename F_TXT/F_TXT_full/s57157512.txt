Right pleural catheter appears to have been withdrawn by 3 cm but terminates within the chest cage. Small right pleural effusion is less than before. Large left pleural effusion is increased with increased rightward mediastinal shift. The right lung base opacity is probably atelectasis. There is persistent complete collapse of left lower lobe.
