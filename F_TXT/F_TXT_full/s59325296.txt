Single portable view of the chest. Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam. The lungs are grossly clear noting some linear opacities in the left mid lung suggestive of atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips again noted.
