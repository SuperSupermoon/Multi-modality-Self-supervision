AP chest compared to ___, most recently ___ at 2:12 p.m.: Right lower lobe collapse has improved, but the lower lobe is still severely atelectatic and/or consolidated. Interval increase in heart size and vascular calibers in the lungs and mediastinum suggest volume overload or cardiac decompensation. Left pleural tube still in place. No pneumothorax or appreciable left pleural effusion. Small right pleural effusion has increased, despite the right pleural drainage catheter. Tiny right apical pneumothorax unchanged. Tip of the endotracheal tube is still above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 6 cm from the carina and the tube should be advanced 2-3 cm for more secured seating. The upper enteric drainage catheter ends in the very proximal stomach and would need to be advanced 6 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Dr. ___ was paged to discuss these findings.
