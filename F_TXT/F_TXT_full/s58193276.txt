Endotracheal tube is 6.4 cm above the carina. An enteric tube terminates in the stomach. Right internal jugular is within the distal superior vena cava. The dense consolidation within the lingula appears unchanged. Further aeration of the left upper lobe likely reflects resolving edema and mild to moderate pulmonary edema persists. The bilateral small pleural effusions are unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
