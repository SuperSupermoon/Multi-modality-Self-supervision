AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. High-positioned diaphragms are explained by poor inspirational effort rather significant when compared with the previous examination where deep inspiration was accomplished. Heart size cannot be assessed but probably unchanged and within normal limits. No pulmonary vascular congestion is identified and no evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates found. The lateral pleural sinuses are free. Again noted is the rather local and marked scoliosis at the transition between thoracolumbar spine resulting in a right basal prominence could be wrongly interpreted as pulmonary density on the frontal view. This is, however, not the case.
