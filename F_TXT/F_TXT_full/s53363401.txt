There is evidence of the moderate cardiomegaly, slightly worsened compared to the exam from ___ however stable compared to the most recent exam. The previously noted vascular congestion in the upper lungs has improved; however, there appears to be an interval increase in the left perihilar opacification compared to the prior exam, suggestive of worsening aspiration. There are stable small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Heterogeneous opacification of the lung apices is likely secondary to scarring.
