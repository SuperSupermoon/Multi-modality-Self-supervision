Transesophageal drainage tube is still looped in the upper esophagus. Lung volumes are low and there is probably some atelectasis at the base the left lung, and perhaps small left pleural effusion, but this has not changed since earlier in the day. Heart is moderately enlarged. A left PIC line ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax.
