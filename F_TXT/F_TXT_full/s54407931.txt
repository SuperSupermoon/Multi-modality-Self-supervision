In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is extensive opacification in both lower lung zones, consistent with layering pleural effusions and underlying atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size and it is somewhat difficult to assess the pulmonary vascularity in view of the prominent effusions. Monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
