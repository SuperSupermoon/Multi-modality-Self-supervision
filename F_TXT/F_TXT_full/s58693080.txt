Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube. Decrease in extent of pulmonary edema, with residual asymmetrical opacities, now predominantly at the lung bases, right greater than left. This likely reflects asymmetrical edema, but continued followup is suggested to exclude the possibility of basilar pneumonia. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
