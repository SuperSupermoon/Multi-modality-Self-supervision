I might question right hilar enlargement and bilateral infrahilar consolidation, but the chest CT scan performed 4 hr later showed only mild left basal atelectasis. Interestingly it showed mild mediastinal adenopathy, which 1 would not expect to see on conventional bedside chest radiograph. THERE IS MILD PULMONARY VASCULAR CONGESTION INCREASED SINCE EARLIER IN THE DAY AND ANY INCREASE IN BORDERLINE CARDIOMEGALY.
