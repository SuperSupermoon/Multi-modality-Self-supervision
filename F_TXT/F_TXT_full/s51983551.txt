Similar to multiple prior exams, there is relative opacification of the left lower lobe which is partially atelectatic but also in part consolidation without volume loss resulting in the relatively bizarre morphology in the retrocardiac left lung. No further consolidation is noted. There is no superimposed edema. The mediastinum is unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged but stable. There is no effusion or pneumothorax. Degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.
