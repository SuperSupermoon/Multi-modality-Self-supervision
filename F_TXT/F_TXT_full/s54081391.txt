AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 9:02 a.m. A loop of catheter projects over the left diaphragmatic region to the right of the midclavicular line. It cannot be localized anatomically on the single frontal view. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, but I cannot assess pleural fluid volume, which could be small or moderate without a lateral projection: Moderate right pleural effusion is stable since earlier in the day. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly has worsened since ___, but there is no pulmonary edema. Lower lobes are substantially obscured, by the heart on the left and by pleural effusion on the right.
