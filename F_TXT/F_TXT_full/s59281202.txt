AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging: Heart may be slightly enlarged, though the ___ are exaggerated by AP and supine positioning and low lung volumes. Lungs are clear. There is no pleural abnormality. Hilar and mediastinal contours are normal. I see no displaced rib fracture, but conventional bedside chest radiographs are not designed for detection of subtle chest cage injury. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
