Interval decrease in size of a right pleural effusion with residual small to moderate effusion and improved aeration of the right lung. Persistent opacities at the right base which may reflect residual atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. The left lung is grossly clear. No large pneumothorax is seen, although there is possibly a tiny right apical pneumothorax. This can be better assessed on followup imaging. No pulmonary edema. Cervical spinal fusion hardware and a right shoulder arthroplasty are incompletely visualized
