No prior studies are available for comparison. The film is noted. An ET tube is identified 2.8 cm from the carina and is in adequate position. There is cardiomegaly. The mediastinum is difficult to evaluate. It appears widened, which may be due to positioning. The pulmonary vasculature appears somewhat crowded likely due to poor inspiratory effort and there are no definite pleural effusions. An NG tube is identified and is seen with its sidehole in the stomach, although the tip is not visualized.
