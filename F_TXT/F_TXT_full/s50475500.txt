Within the left retrocardiac region, projecting lateral to the costochondral calcifications, there is a 5.6 x 2.8 cm radiodense structure of uncertain etiology, possibly related to summation of normal thoracic structures. The lungs are otherwise clear. The heart is top normal in size. The mediastinal contours are normal. There are no definite pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. Marked dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is noted.
