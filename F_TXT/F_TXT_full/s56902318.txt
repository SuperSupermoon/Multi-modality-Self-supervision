1. Interval appearance of a moderate-sized layering right pleural effusion with associated basilar air-space process which may reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. Left lung is grossly clear. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged, although the right heart border is obscured by the air-space consolidation. No pneumothorax.
