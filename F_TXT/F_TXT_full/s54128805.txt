After discontinuation of the left chest tube, there is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax at the apex. Small loculation of air within the left lung base cannot be entirely excluded. Bibasilar minimal atelectases are noted. Overall, no interval change since the prior study seen. The heart size and mediastinum are stable.
