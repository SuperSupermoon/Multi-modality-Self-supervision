A left-sided pacemaker remains in place. A right upper lobe consolidation with a component of volume loss is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged, left greater than right. An airspace opacity at the left lung base may be due to infection and/or atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Right costophrenic angle opacification could be due to vessels or atelectasis, but the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
