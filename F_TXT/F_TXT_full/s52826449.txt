As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. At very low lung volumes, there is mild cardiomegaly and potential crowding of the vascular and interstitial structures. However, there is no circumscript opacity suggestive of pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. Monitoring and support devices are constant.
