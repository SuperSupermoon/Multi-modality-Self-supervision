A pleural effusion has increased and now the left hemithorax is almost entirely opacified with a small lucent area in the upper left lung as well as a vague lucency at the left lung apex. These findings could be seen with small areas of residual aerated lung, although not well evaluated on chest radiography. Retrocardiac air bronchograms are visible suggesting opacified lung, probably extensive atelectasis. The opacified left hemithorax bulges rightward with substantial new rightward mediastinal shift. However, the right lung remains clear, without pleural effusion.
