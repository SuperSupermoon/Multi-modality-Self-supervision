In comparison to the recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, a confluent opacity in the right mid lung persists and there is now worsening opacity in the right infrahilar region. Aspiration and/or developing infectious pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Within the left lung, patchy and linear atelectasis is slightly worsened in the retrocardiac area. No other relevant change.
