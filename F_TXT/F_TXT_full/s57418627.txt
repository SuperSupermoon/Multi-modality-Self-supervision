Single frontal view of the chest provided. There is a mild atelectasis of the left lung base. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle could be due to a trace right pleural effusion. No focal consolidation, or pneumothorax. There is prominent superior right mediastinal contour, likely from the tortuosity of great vessels as seen on the C-spine CT of the same day. The cardiac silhouette is normal. Imaged bones are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
