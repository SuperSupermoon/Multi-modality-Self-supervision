The lung volumes are extremely low, which cause accentuation of the mediastinum and crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Within this limitation, the heart is likely mildly enlarged. The endotracheal tube ends 2 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube ends in the stomach. Overlying clips from the patient's bra and EKG clips are noted. A square radioopaque device obscure assessment of the medial right lung base. Bilateral lower lobe opacities most likely represent atelectasis; however, infection cannot be excluded.
