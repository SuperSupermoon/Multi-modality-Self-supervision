As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is after first rib resection. There is no convincing evidence of a left apical pneumothorax. A post-surgical drain is in situ. Lung volume on the left is substantially reduced and there might be a small left pleural effusion. A curvilinear opacity paralleling the lower edge of the 2nd rib corresponds to a skinfold.
