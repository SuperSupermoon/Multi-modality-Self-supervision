AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Status post sternotomy, bypass surgery and mitral valve replacement, unchanged as before. Similarly unchanged position of previously described left-sided PICC line. During the latest examination interval, a left-sided VATS procedure has been performed and two chest tubes have been placed. One of these follows the diaphragmatic contour and reaches close to the lower mediastinal area. The second chest tube also advanced from the lower left lateral wall, is directed in cranial direction and terminates in suprahilar position. The remaining left lung tissue remains well aerated and there is no evidence of any significant pneumothorax. The previously present sizeable massive left-sided pleural density has been evacuated. Degree of mediastinal shift towards the right has improved.
