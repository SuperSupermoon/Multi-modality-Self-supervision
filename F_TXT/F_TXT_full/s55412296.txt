1. Interval removal of one of three right-sided chest tubes with two remaining unchanged in position. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Lung volumes remain low with patchy opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. The pulmonary vasculature and interstitium appear slightly more ill defined on the current study raising the possibility of a component of mild interstitial edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given differences in positioning and technique between studies.
