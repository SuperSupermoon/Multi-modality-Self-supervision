Increased opacification of the left lung with leftward mediastinal shift is suggestive of increased left lung collapse from prior exam. Opacity of the right lung base could represent atelectasis, however cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting. Along the lateral border of the right lung, there is again seen a fluid collection adjacent to several rib fractures which are more displaced than on prior exam. This fluid collection is larger than on prior exam and likely reflect ongoing bleeding into the extra-pleural space. There is increased right pleural effusion from prior exam. The cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be well evaluated due to collapse of left lung. Right anterior shoulder dislocation and multiple right-sided chronic rib fractures are again noted.
