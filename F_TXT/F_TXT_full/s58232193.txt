Tracheostomy is in standard position. The right subclavian line ends in the lower SVC. Ill-defined right basilar opacity has increased since ___. Although there is some volume loss suggesting a component of atelectasis, the finding is concerning for recurrent pneumonia. The left lung is clear aside from unchanged linear atelectasis in the left midlung, with interval improvement of left basilar opacity. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are normal.
