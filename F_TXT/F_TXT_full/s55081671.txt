A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The patient is very rotated. Scattered extensive bilateral air space opacities are noted, right worse than left, some of which have a rounded appearance, likely pneumonia. The minor fissure is elevated suggesting right upper lobe atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus may represent a tiny pleural effusion. No left effusion. A small sclerotic focus in the proximal right humerus is incompletely evaluated, probably a bone island.
