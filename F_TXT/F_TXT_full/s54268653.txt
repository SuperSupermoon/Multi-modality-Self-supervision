A portable view of the chest demonstrates some accumulation of a left pleural effusion compared to yesterday's chest radiograph. There are low lung volumes, but the right lung is grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. A left chest tube remains in the left lower lateral hemithorax. A left IJ projects over the origin of the SVC.
