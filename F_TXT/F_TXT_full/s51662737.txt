Status post median sternotomy with intact and aligned sternotomy wires. A left pectoral AICD remains in place. Increased bilateral interstitial opacities are most likely due to worsening pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is also stable. There is no pneumothorax.
