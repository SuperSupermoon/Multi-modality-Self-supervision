Right internal jugular line ends in the mid to lower SVC. Bilateral pleural effusions are moderate volume, increased, and symmetric. I doubt that the right pleural effusion is related to complications of central line manipulations. Mild cardiomegaly has increased. There is no pulmonary edema. Bibasilar pulmonary opacification is probably atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present.
