As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, potentially caused by increased ventilatory pressures. Signs of moderate pulmonary edema still present, but have overall slightly decreased as compared to the previous image. The monitoring and support devices, including the Swan-Ganz catheter are in unchanged position. Moderate cardiomegaly with relatively extensive retrocardiac and right basal atelectasis persist. Minimal left pleural effusion is likely.
