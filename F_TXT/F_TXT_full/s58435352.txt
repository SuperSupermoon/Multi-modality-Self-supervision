Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits except for distention of the azygos vein. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present, but there is no overt pulmonary edema. Lungs are clear except for minimal patchy opacities in the retrocardiac regions, most likely due to patchy atelectasis. Focal aspiration and early site of infectious pneumonia are also possible, and short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard if warranted clinically.
