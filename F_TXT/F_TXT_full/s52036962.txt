An ET tube terminates 5.5 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are generally low, but lungs are otherwise clear. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. No pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. A tube external to the patient, as confirmed by the patient's nurse, projects over the expected course a left-sided IJ might pass through. The patient's nurse confirmed no central excess, only for peripheral IVs.
