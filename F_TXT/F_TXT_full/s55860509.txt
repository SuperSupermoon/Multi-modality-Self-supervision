Cardiac silhouette is enlarged accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion, perihilar haziness and peripheral interstitial edema. More confluent opacities at the lung bases could reflect a combination of dependent edema and atelectasis, but other process such as aspiration and infectious pneumonia is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Small-to-moderate left and small right pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
