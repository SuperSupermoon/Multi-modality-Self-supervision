Portable chest radiograph demonstrates a pleural drain in constant position. There is no pneumothorax. There has been no recurrence of left pleural effusion. Blunting of the right posterior close costophrenic angle is consistent with a small pleural effusion. There is no new focal consolidation. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged in appearance. There is no overt pulmonary edema. A biliary drain and stent is incompletely visualized in the right upper quadrant. When compared to prior films dated ___, there has been no appreciable radiographic change to explain new tachypnea/tachycardia.
