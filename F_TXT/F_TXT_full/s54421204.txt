An AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. There is status post right lower VATS procedure with an approximately 2 x 4 cm parenchymal density in the right lung base in supradiaphragmatic position. A right-sided chest tube has been placed apparently entering in the right lateral lower chest wall and reaching the apical area before it reverses back apparently terminating in the posterior pleural sinus. The right lung appears normally aerated although the volume of the right hemithorax is somewhat smaller than on the left. Also noted is some local chest wall emphysema along the right-sided lateral chest wall. No conclusive evidence for any pneumothorax with a chest tube in place. No other gross abnormalities can be identified on this single view chest portable examination with patient in semi-erect position. Our records do not include a preceding preoperative chest examination for comparison.
