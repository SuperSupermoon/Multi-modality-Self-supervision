Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Large bilateral pleural effusions are stable, are associated with bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side consistent with atelectasis. Asymmetric right mid lung opacity is consistent with enlarging atelectasis in the right middle lobe, better seen on prior CT from ___. There is no evident pneumothorax. Moderate vascular congestion is stable. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position. There are no new lung abnormalities.
