Compared with chest radiograph on ___, a right basilar opacity is slightly worsened, and there has been interval slight increase in pulmonary vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema. There is continued bibasilar atelectasis and small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, similar to prior. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to prior. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6 cm above the carina. A left IJ central catheter terminates in the right atrium. A right-sided central catheter terminates in the low SVC. An enteric tube passes below the level of the diaphragm and terminates in the stomach. Again seen is high density contrast agent over the gastric fundus, may reflect prior sclerotherapy.
