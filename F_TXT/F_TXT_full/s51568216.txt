Lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation of the lung bases, with perihilar atelectasis. Within this limitation, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen. The aorta is tortuous. Heart size is difficult to evaluate in the setting of markedly low lung volumes. A right-sided Port-A-Cath tip projects at the level of the cavoatrial junction, as seen previously. Density in the aortopulmonary window appears similar compared to prior and likely corresponds to calcified nodes, as seen on prior CT. Sternal wires appear intact.
