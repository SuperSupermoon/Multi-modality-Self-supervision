Left-sided PICC terminates in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. There is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggesting small pleural effusion with possibly overlying atelectasis. Right base opacity persists, possibly minimally improved. No large pleural effusion seen on the right. No overt pulmonary edema. Stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes.
