The moderate volume of air loculated in the left lower pleural space, following evacuation of pleural effusion is is probably smaller, compared to ___, but there is probably an increase in the volume of residual pleural fluid, as well as persistent thickening of the pleura that is probably responsible for failure of the largely atelectatic lingula and left lower lobe to re-expand. In the superior division of the left upper lobe mild pulmonary edema persists. There is new atelectasis at the base the right lung. The right upper lung is clear. Pleural effusion on the right is minimal if any. No pneumothorax on that side. Supraclavicular central venous infusion port catheter ends in the mid right atrium as before.
