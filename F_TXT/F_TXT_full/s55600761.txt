Compared with ___ just after midnight, the right IJ catheter has been removed. No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen is a left IJ catheter with tip at the expected confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and SVC. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, bilateral effusions, and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Right midzone lateral calcified granuloma again noted.
