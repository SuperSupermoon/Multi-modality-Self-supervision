AP view of the chest provided. There is near total opacification of the left lung, with residual right upper lobe aeration. There is no contralateral shift of mediastinal structures. Altogether, these findings are concerning for partially collapsed left lung that is most likely due to mucus plugging. There is additional moderate amount of layering pleural effusion on the left. Compared to prior study, the right juxta-hilar region opacity appears much worse, likely reflective of atelectasis however aspiration pneumonia is also certainly a possibility. There is a small to moderate amount of pleural effusion on the right.
