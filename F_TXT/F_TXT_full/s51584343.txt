Comparison is made to prior study performed four hours earlier. ET tube tip is 2 cm above the carina with chin down. There is mild increase in now mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Right lower atelectasis has increased. There is a probably small right pleural effusion. There are persistent low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. NT tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
