Lung volumes have generally improved and the cardiomediastinal silhouette has a normal postoperative appearance. A flame shaped opacity projecting over the left upper lung is more obvious following resolution of previous left-sided atelectasis and decreasing left pleural effusion. It was not present preoperatively. It is either loculated pleural fluid or upper lobe consolidation. Because of this location, I cannot attribute it to atelectasis and pneumonia is therefore the major concern. Right jugular sheath ends just above the thoracic inlet. No pneumothorax.
