There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous line which terminates at the cavoatrial junction. An endotracheal tube is in stable position, and an enteric tube terminates in the distal stomach. There has been interval decrease in the low lung volumes causing crowding of the central bronchovascular structures. There is a left retrocardiac opacity which may reflect atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is stable in size.
