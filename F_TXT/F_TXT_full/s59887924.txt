A left internal jugular dialysis catheter terminates in the distal SVC. A right internal jugular temporary pacing wire is in appropriate position, the tip appears to be in the right ventricle. There is a persistent right pleural effusion. Hazy opacity throughout the right lung is likely due to layering of the pleural effusion, difficult to exclude underlying consolidation. There is moderate pulmonary vascular congestion, similar in appearance when compared to the prior study.
