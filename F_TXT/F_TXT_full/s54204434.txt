Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, accompanied by pulmonary vascular and azygos vein distention. Lower lobe predominant bilateral alveolar opacities are present, and could reflect dependent pulmonary edema or a co-existing aspiration or infectious pneumonia in the appropriate clinical settings. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
