Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip that has been inserted terminates 4 cm above the carina. The catheter continuing from the IVC up towards the right atrium most likely represents hemodialysis access or central venous access through the femoral approach. Left mediastinal shift is unchanged, but there is substantially improved aeration of the left lung after intubation with still present left lower lung atelectasis. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Most likely vascular stent is projecting over the expected location of left brachiocephalic vein as well as additional stent projecting over the expected location of the axillary vein is noted.
