AP chest compared to ___ and ___ at 7:57 a.m.: There has been considerable decrease in the volume of left pleural effusion, now small to moderate, indistinguishable from pleural thickening or loculation. The texture of the newly revealed left lung is of concern for nodules and should be reevaluated after the lung has had the opportunity to fully reexpand. A definite new development is consolidation in the axillary region of the right upper lobe raising concern for new pneumonia, improved slightly on subsequent chest radiograph, performed 7:23 a.m. on ___, available at the time of this review, but also showing greater opacification at the right lung base. This all suggests pneumonia. House staff will be notified. No pneumothorax.
