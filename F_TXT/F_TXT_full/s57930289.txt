Overall, there is improvement in the pulmonary edema. There is still prominence of the perihilar vasculature and mild interstitial edema. The heart remains stably enlarged along with the mediastinal contours. A tracheostomy tube is remains in satisfactory position. Lung volumes remain low. The patient's mandible obscures the lung apices but no obvious pneumothorax is appreciated. No large effusions. No developing airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
