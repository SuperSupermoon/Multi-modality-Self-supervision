Lung volumes are lower and borderline cardiomegaly is new. There is no pulmonary edema. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are continuous from the new or newly repositioned right pectoral generator. The ventricular lead is oriented superiorly, rather than parallel to the floor of the right ventricle. There is no pneumothorax, appreciable pleural effusion, or attendant mediastinal widening.
