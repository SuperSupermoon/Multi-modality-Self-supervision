Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with dense atherosclerotic calcification again seen in the thoracic aorta. The aorta remains tortuous. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Streaky linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Old bilateral rib fractures are noted.
