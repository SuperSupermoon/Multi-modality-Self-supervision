As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right-sided dialysis catheter. The tip of the catheter projects over the lower SVC. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities show no substantial change. The opacities are now predominating at the right and left lung base as well as in the left perihilar areas. The lung volumes have slightly decreased, the size of the cardiac silhouette is clearly enlarged. The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded, given minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus.
