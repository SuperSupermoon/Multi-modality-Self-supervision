AP chest compared to ___, 5:17 a.m.: Previously substantial right pleural effusion is much smaller, effectively resolved. No pneumothorax. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion persists. Elevation of left hemidiaphragm is either due to or reflects left lower lobe atelectasis. 3 cm wide spherical opacity projecting lateral to the left hilus could be a genuine lung nodule, more likely fissural pleural fluid or external artifact related to endotracheal tube. This abnormality should be looked for on subsequent chest radiographs.
