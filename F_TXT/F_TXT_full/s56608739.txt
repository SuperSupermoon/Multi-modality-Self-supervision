Portable AP chest radiograph. Right-sided PICC tip is in the lower SVC. Three biliary stents and surgical clips project over the right upper quadrant. Persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is predominantly due to perihepatic ascites, but a small pleural effusion was also demonstrated on yesterday's CTA. There is no pulmonary edema. Mild atelectasis in the left lung base is also present on prior CT. There is no pneumothorax.
