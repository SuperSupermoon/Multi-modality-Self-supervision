Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and accompanied by distention of the vascular pedicle, and pulmonary vascular distention. Bilateral heterogeneous lung opacities have markedly progressed and are now present diffusely, with more confluent consolidation developing in the right mid and lower lung. Observed findings may be due to asymmetrical edema given clinical suspicion for fluid overload, but superimposed pneumonia should be considered in the right lung, in the appropriate clinical setting, and followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
