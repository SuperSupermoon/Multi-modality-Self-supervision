In comparison with the study of ___, the hazy opacification in the right hemithorax is somewhat less prominent, though this could reflect merely change in degree of upright position of the patient rather than difference in the degree of pleural effusion. There is increased opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Tracheostomy tube remains unchanged.
