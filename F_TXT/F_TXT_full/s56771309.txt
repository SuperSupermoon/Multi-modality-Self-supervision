As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position. There is no visible pneumothorax. The overall density of the lung parenchyma has also increased, which is likely a function of the decreased lung volumes. Mild areas of atelectasis at the lung bases, borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. The heart size should be monitored closely as an increase might reflect pericardial effusion.
