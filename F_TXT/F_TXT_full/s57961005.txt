A left IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is present, tip overlying the distal right pulmonary artery. Clinical correlation is requested, as this lies relatively distal. Allowing for considerable differences in technique, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Upper zone re-distribution and mild vascular plethora is similar. Moderate-sized right effusion, with underlying collapse or consolidation at the right base, and increased retrocardiac density consistent with lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation are essentially unchanged. Extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film, but no gross effusion is identified. No pneumothorax detected.
