There are pre-existing metastatic changes at both lung bases, but more extensive at the left, visualized in almost unchanged manner. Also unchanged is the size of the cardiac silhouette and the appearance of the left pectoral Port-A-Cath. New, however, is the subtle peribronchial pattern of opacity at the right lung bases. The opacity shows subtle air bronchograms. These findings could be suggestive of pneumonia. No evidence of pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
