AP chest reviewed in the absence of a prior chest imaging: Lung volumes are normal and there is no atelectasis, pneumothorax or pleural effusion. A region of increased opacification in the left upper lobe projecting over the second anterior interspace could be a small region of atelectasis. Followup advised to exclude early pneumonia. Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.
