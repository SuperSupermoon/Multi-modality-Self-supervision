No previous images. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and there is evidence of pulmonary edema which is somewhat asymmetric favoring the left. Since this is somewhat unusual, the possibility of aspiration would have to be considered. There is bibasilar opacification consistent with atelectasis and small pleural effusions. This information was discussed with the neurosurgery resident. The patient will be given respiratory toilet and treatment for the elevated pulmonary venous pressure. A repeat study can then be obtained to determine whether there is any residual opacification that could represent aspiration.
