5 cm long Peripheral mass like opacity in the right upper hemi thorax with a convex medial margin, could be infection, infarction, or pleural mass or fluid collection. Conventional chest radiographs might be helpful in making the distinction, but CT or CTA scanning may prove necessary Mild interstitial edema and vascular congestion are evident in the left Lung and is more severe in the right lung. Even greater opacification in the right lung base is a pattern of previous episodes of edema in this patient and need not therefore be due to concurrent pneumonia, even though the upper lung process could be infectious. Heart size is normal. Dependent pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax.
