As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right pleural effusion has decreased in extent. There is re-expansion edema at the bases of the right lung, notably in the middle lobe. A minimal pleural effusion on the left is obviously unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Signs of mild to moderate fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No new focal parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax. The course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged.
