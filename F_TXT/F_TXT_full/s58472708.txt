AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size is normal. Mild dextroscoliosis contributes to the tortuosity of the aorta. Lungs are essentially clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax demonstrated. There is questionable opacity projecting behind the left cardiac silhouette above the diaphragm that potentially might represent posterior hernia, correlation with lateral view is recommended.
