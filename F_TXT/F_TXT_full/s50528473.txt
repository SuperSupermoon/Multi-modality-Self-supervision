The endotracheal tube projects approximately 7 cm above the carina, at the thoracic inlet. Right IJ central venous catheter is at cavoatrial junction. NG tube tip sub- diaphragmatic. Bilateral heterogeneous parenchymal opacities have increased compared to the prior examination and the interval change could be related to increased edema, however, the heterogeneous nodular multifocal opacities seen on the prior radiograph raise suspicion for multifocal pneumonia or septic emboli. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
