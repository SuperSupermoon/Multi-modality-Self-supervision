Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 4.4 cm above the level of carina. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There are bilateral opacities, particularly perihilar, which may be due to underlying fluid overload, although underlying infection is not excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Amorphous calcification is seen projecting over the soft tissue in the left axilla.
