Compared with the prior radiograph, lung volumes are lower, causing crowding of bronchovascular structures. Patient is post CABG with intact median sternotomy wires and unchanged mediastinal clips. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or pneumothorax. A calcified 1.1 cm granuloma, as seen on this chest CT, is noted in the right lower lung. Although chest radiograph is not optimal for evaluation after chest trauma, no acute bony abnormality identified.
