Comparison is made with prior study performed earlier in the morning. There is mild cardiomegaly. The aorta is elongated. Right lower lobe opacities have increased, consistent with increasing atelectasis. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. ET tube is in standard position. The tip is 3.8 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. No pneumothorax. Right pleural effusion is small. There are low lung volumes. Sternal wires are aligned.
