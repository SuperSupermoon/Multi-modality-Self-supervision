Nasogastric tube terminates in region of the gastroduodenal junction. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique, and lungs are clear except for minimal linear atelectasis at the left lung base. Although no free intraperitoneal air is identified below the diaphragm, the right upper quadrant of the abdomen appears relatively lucent. This finding can be associated with free air but may also be technical in nature. Given clinical concern for free intraperitoneal air, an upright or left lateral decubitus view would be recommended to address this question.
