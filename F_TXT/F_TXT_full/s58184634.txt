Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Prominence of the pulmonary artery is redemonstrated, consistent with pulmonary hypertension. No interval change in the small amount of pleural effusion is noted. There is no pneumothorax. There is mild vascular engorgement, but no overt edema seen and overall, no change since prior examination noted.
