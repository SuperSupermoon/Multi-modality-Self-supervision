As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pigtail catheter was removed from the pleural space. There is a small apical lateral right-sided pneumothorax, limited to the apical lateral parts of the hemi thorax. Close radiographic monitoring should be performed. No other relevant changes are noted. The other monitoring and support devices are in constant position. Moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral parenchymal opacities at the lung bases persist.
