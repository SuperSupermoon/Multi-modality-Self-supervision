Opacities in the right lung base may be due to mild pulmonary edema but concurrent infection cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting. The heart size is mildly increased compared to same day outside exam, although still top normal in size. No pneumothorax. Surgical clips are seen in the right axilla.
