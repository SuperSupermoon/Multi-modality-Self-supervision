ET tube is seen with tip approximately 3 cm from the carina. Enteric tube passes below the inferior field of view. Low lung volumes are noted. Parenchymal opacities are seen bilaterally, right greater than left likely due to edema, infection or aspiration not excluded. Layering effusion would be difficult to exclude. Left lateral rib fractures are suspected. No obvious pneumothorax on this portable film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly within normal limits.
