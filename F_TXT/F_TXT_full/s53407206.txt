Diffusely increased parenchymal opacities, cardiomediastinal and hilar enlargement and indistinctness is consistent with new mild pulmonary edema. A small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Asymmetric increased density of the left base may be due to asymmetric edema, though pneumonia is possible in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no pneumothorax.
