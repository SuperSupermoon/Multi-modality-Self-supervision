1. Interval removal of a right internal jugular central line. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which has its tip within the stomach, although the side port is near but just below the gastroesophageal junction. It would be prudent to advance the tube somewhat to minimize the risk of aspiration. The right lung is grossly clear. There continues to be patchy opacity at the left base which does not appear to be significantly changed since ___ may reflect an area of atelectasis, aspiration, early pneumonia or possibly asymmetric edema given the fact that there is pulmonary venous hypertension and a suggestion of mild interstitial edema. Correlation is advised. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Calcifications in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. No pneumothorax.
