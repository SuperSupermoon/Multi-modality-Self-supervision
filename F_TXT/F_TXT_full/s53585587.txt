1. Tracheostomy tube, nasogastric tube, left internal jugular central line remain in place. Lung volumes remain low with a bilateral airspace process which appears to have worsened since the prior study given differences in technique between the images. Findings would favor worsening pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia, but clinical correlation would be advised. Likely small bilateral layering effusions. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
