Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier. There are low lung volumes with increasing bibasilar left greater than right atelectasis. There has been interval mild worsening of widespread parenchymal opacities, reflecting worsening infectious/inflamatory process. I doubt the presence at this time of pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal contours are obscured by the lung abnormalities. There is no evident pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.
