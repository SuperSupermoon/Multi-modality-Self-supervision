As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain low. However, the bilateral areas of basal opacities have decreased in extent. A plate-like atelectasis is now seen at the right lung bases. Mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. Mild cardiomegaly. The left PICC line is unchanged.
