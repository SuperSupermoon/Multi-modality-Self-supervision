In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is an placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends at least to the upper stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the image. Central catheter from the right IJ approach has its tip in the region of the midportion of the SVC. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged without definite vascular congestion. Again there are pleural effusions bilaterally with underlying compressive atelectasis, more prominent on the right.
