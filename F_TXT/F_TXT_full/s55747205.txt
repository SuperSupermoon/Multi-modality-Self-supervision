Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right internal jugular central venous catheter in unchanged position. As compared to prior chest radiographs from earlier today, there is interval worsening of mild to moderate pulmonary edema. Opacity abutting the minor fissure could reflect aspiration. No large pleural effusion noted. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
