As compared to the previous radiograph, the drain on the right has been removed. The esophageal stent is in unchanged position. Unchanged left PICC line. Minimal bilateral pleural effusions and minimal areas of bilateral atelectasis. A 2 mm pneumothorax is seen at the right lung apex. No evidence of tension. However, the change should be followed with short-term radiographs.
