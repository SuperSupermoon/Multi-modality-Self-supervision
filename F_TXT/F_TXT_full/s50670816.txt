In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is probably little change in the degree of apical pneumothorax. Fluid is seen in the pleural space at the base. There is suggestion of some increased prominence of pulmonary vessels, consistent with some worsening pulmonary vascular engorgement. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists.
