AP chest compared to ___: Very extensive infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has not changed since ___. In the right lung, it is confluent centrally but at the periphery and throughout the left lung very heterogeneous, with suggestion of cystic lucencies and nodules which point to disseminated infection rather than simple pulmonary edema. This process has been present since a CT of the chest performed ___ at ___. Interestingly, the patient had a similar though less severe pulmonary abnormality documented on the chest CT performed ___, which subsequently improved. Either she had widespread infection at that time, in which case the current pathogen should be the same, e.g., fungus, or she has a recurrent inflammatory condition such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or therapy responsve nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. Correlation of current conditions and imaging with previous clinical findings and concurrent imaging should be extremely helpful.
