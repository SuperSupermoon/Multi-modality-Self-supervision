The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with moderate cardiomegaly. Right basilar opacity is likely a reflection of pleural effusion and atelectasis, increased compared the prior study, although underlying consolidation is not excluded. There is no significant left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Right upper paramediastinal density appears smaller compared to prior and is likely related to prior VATS. Pulmonary edema is worsened compared to the most recent prior study and is moderate to severe. Left chest wall dual lead pacemaker defibrillator is present with tip terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle as expected.
