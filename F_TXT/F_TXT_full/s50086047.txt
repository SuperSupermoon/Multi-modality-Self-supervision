There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter which terminates in the low SVC/ cavoatrial junction without evidence of pneumothorax. Mild basilar atelectasis is seen without definite focal consolidation. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
