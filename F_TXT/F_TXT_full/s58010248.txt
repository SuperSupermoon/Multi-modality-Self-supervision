Since the recent radiograph, the patient has been intubated, with tip of endotracheal tube terminating about 2.8 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is in placed, and terminates below the diaphragm. Otherwise, the appearance of the chest is relatively similar to the recent radiograph of one hour earlier except for slight improved aeration at the lung bases.
