Again seen are 2 right-sided chest tubes. Allowing for differences in technique, no gross change is detected compared with ___ at 14:55. Again seen is the large right effusion, likely with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. The degree of opacification may be very slightly worse, but is likely accentuated by technical differences. No right-sided pneumothorax is detected. Mild vascular plethora in the upper zones is again noted. There is minimal increased retrocardiac opacity, but the left hemi diaphragm remains readily visible. No gross left effusion. Marked cardiomegaly with sternotomy wires again noted, similar to the prior film. Left-sided central line again noted, with tip over proximal/mid SVC.
