As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, potentially due to increased ventilatory pressures. The size of the cardiac silhouette is still enlarged, but areas of bilateral basal parenchymal opacity have decreased in severity and extent. Minimal fluid overload is still present. Remaining right lower lobe atelectasis. No larger pleural effusions. No newly appeared parenchymal changes.
