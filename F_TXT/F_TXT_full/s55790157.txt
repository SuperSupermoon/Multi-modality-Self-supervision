Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities may relate to vascular crowding, although infection or aspiration is not excluded. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to overlying soft tissue, although a trace pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
