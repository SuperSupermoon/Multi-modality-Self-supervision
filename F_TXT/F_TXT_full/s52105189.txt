As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left-sided pigtail catheter. The left lung appears substantially better expanded than on the previous films. Remnant left opacity likely reflects re-expansion edema. A small portion of apical medial pneumothorax is seen just above the aortic arch. There is remaining pleural fluid obliterating the left costophrenic sinus. No evidence of tension. Unchanged appearance of the multiple displaced rib fractures. Known mild cardiomegaly. Unchanged appearance of the right hemithorax.
