Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate endotracheal tube in position with tip 4.4 cm above the carina, essentially unchanged from previous imaging. There is some opacification at the left lung base again seen, which likely represents atelectasis but cannot rule out an effusion. Opacification in the right lung base may represent atelectasis; however, in appropriate clinical setting, could also be concerning for pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or other complication seen. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
