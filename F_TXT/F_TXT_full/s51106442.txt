A right-sided dialysis catheter enters the right atrium. A left pectoral AICD remains in place with lead placement reflecting variant anatomy, including a persistent left SVC. The layering left pleural effusion has decreased, and is now small. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Unchanged retrocardiac opacification is due to unchanged left lower lobe collapse. The right lung remains clear.
