Support lines and tubes are unchanged in position. The nasogastric tube tip sideport is still at the GE junction and could be advanced a few cm for more optimal placement. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Small bilateral effusions are seen. There are vague opacities at the bases suggestive of atelectasis or developing infiltrates. This is stable. No pneumothoraces are seen.
