Endotracheal tube in standard placement, tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC. Lung volumes remain quite low. Interval increase in caliber of the mediastinum at the level of the aortic arch is probably due to mediastinal venous engorgement. No pneumothorax.
