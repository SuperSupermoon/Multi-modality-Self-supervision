Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Small to moderate partially layering left pleural effusion has slightly increased in size whereas a small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Worsening bibasilar lung opacities most likely represent atelectasis, although coexisting aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia are also possible in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no detectable pneumothorax. Diffuse haziness in the imaged upper abdomen corresponds to the presence of ascites on separately dictated CT of the abdomen of the same date.
