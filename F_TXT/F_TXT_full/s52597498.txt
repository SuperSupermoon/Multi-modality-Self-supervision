In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary congestion and bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the right. The possibility of supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. Obliquity of the patient makes it difficult to compare the size of the mediastinum, though no definite widening is appreciated. If clinically warranted, repeat study without obliquity could be obtained for comparison with the prior examination. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
