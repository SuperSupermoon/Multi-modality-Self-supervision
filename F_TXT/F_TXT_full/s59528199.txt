The lungs are hypoinflated. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is new. More focal confluent opacity in the left lower lung field, which partially obscures the left heart border is noted as well as vague opacification of the right lung base. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present. There is no pneumothorax. A tortuous aorta is again seen and unchanged from prior. Cardiac size is slightly enlarged, stable. Bony structures are unremarkable.
