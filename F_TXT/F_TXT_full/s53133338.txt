In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion. Left chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is again widening of the superior mediastinum. This could well represent merely postoperative changes in a patient of this size. However, if there is any clinical suspicion for mediastinal hemorrhage, CT would be the next imaging procedure. Mild opacification at the left base is consistent with small effusion and atelectatic changes.
