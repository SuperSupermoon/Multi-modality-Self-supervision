Comparison is made to the previous study from ___. There has been removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter. There is a right IJ central line with the distal lead tip at the proximal right atrium.

There is atelectasis at the left lung base. There is mild pulmonary interstitial prominence. No pneumothoraces are present.
