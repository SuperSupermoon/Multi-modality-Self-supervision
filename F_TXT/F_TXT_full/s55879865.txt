Endotracheal tube tip is low lying, terminating approximately 1.9 cm from the carina. Enteric tube tip and side port terminate within the stomach. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Lung volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular structures. There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution which may be due to supine positioning. Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases, possibly atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Contrast is noted within the collecting systems bilaterally as well as within the left colon possibly from recent CT examination.
