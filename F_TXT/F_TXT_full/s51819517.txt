Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen, with the tip at least to the level of the gastroesophageal junction, and off the inferior borders of the film. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with evidence of mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral layering pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified.
