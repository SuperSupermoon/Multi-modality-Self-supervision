Mildly kyphotic positioning slightly limits assessment. The patient is status post median sternotomy. There is moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette which is unchanged. The aorta is tortuous, similar compared to the previous study. No pulmonary edema is seen. Linear opacities within the lung bases are compatible with subsegmental atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. Multiple clips are seen projecting over the right axilla. Remote right-sided rib fractures are re- demonstrated.
