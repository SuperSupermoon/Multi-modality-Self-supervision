1. Left subclavian PICC line with its tip in the mid-to-distal SVC. Endotracheal tube has its tip 4.5 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular large-bore catheter has its tip in the right atrium, unchanged. Gastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 2. Bilateral pleural pigtail catheters are again seen and are unchanged in position. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in this postoperative patient status post median sternotomy with mitral valve annuloplasty. Increasing opacity at right lung base and the costophrenic angle which could represent accumulating fluid or an area of evolving pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities at left base likely reflects atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
