A single portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was obtained. Heart is mildly enlarged. Calcifications are present in the aortic arch. Deviation of the trachea to the right is probably due to an enlarged thyroid. There are diffuse bilateral opacities with perihilar distribution and more prominent in the lower zone, consistent with moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are also present. The degree of pulmonary edema limits assessment for focal consolidation. There is no pneumothorax.
