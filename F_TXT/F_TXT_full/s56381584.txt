The previously large left pleural effusion has significantly decreased and is now moderate in size. The right lung and left upper lung are well aerated and clear. Dense opacity continues to overlie the left lower lung representing a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours appear normal. The left cardiac contour remains incompletely evaluated due to overlying opacity. A left pigtail catheter terminates in the inferior hemithorax, and there is no evidence of apical pneumothorax. Surgical clips in the right chest wall may be due to prior breast sugery.
