1. ET tube tip 9 mm above the carina pointing towards the right mainstem bronchus. Clinical correlation regarding slight retraction, approximately 1 cm, is requested. (Please see subsequent CXR showing ETT has been removed.) 2. Patchy but diffuse bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities, considerably progressed compared with ___, with layering left effusion and continued left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. This could represent asymmetric CHF with pulmonary edema. The possibility of infectious infiltrates should also be considered. At least some of this could represent sequela of prior aspiration.
