Pulmonary edema has substantially cleared in the upper lungs. Left lower lobe remains densely consolidated, presumably collapsed,, and there is probably substantial atelectasis in the right lower lobe as well. Volume of pleural effusion is difficult to assess, but probably not large. Mild cardiac enlargement is new. No pneumothorax. ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements and a esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Upper abdominal drains noted.
