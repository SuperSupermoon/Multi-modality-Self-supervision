Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position. Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures.

Worsening bibasilar opacities are present and may reflect a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, but underlying infection is also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
