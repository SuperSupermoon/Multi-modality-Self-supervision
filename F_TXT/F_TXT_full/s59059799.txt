AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates stable cardiomediastinal silhouette. No definitive pneumothorax is noted on the current study. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal consolidations are noted. Overall, no definitive focal consolidation which could be new and explain the patient's symptoms is demonstrated but bibasal or unibasal pneumonia is a possibility.
