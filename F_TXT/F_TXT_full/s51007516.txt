Single AP semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.6 cm above level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen, coursing below the level of the diaphragm, to the expected location of the stomach, although the inferior aspect is not fully included on the image. Three rounded radiopaque structures are again seen projecting over the left cardiac silhouette. There is minimal left base streaky retrocardiac opacity, most likely relates to atelectasis, although underlying aspiration would not be excluded. No large focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified.
