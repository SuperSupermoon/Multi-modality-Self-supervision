In comparison with the study of ___, there has been some improvement in the bilateral pulmonary opacifications, most likely reflecting decreased pulmonary vascular congestion. Bilateral layering effusions persist with opacification in the retrocardiac region consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. The right jugular catheter has been removed. The left subclavian line extends to about the level of the cavoatrial junction.
