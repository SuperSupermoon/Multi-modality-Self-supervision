AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding previous chest examination dated ___. The patient is now intubated and ETT seen to terminate in the trachea 3 cm above the level of the carina. A right internal jugular approach central venous line is now present again noted to terminate in the right-sided upper mediastinal structures at the level of the carina. This corresponds to the mid portion of the SVC. An NG tube has been placed seen to pass below the diaphragm including the side port. The tip of this line escapes the lower border of this chest image. In comparison with the previous examination, there is marked increase of pleural densities surrounding the left lung and completely obliterating the diaphragmatic contours in the left hemithorax.
