ET tube is seen with tip approximately 8.2 cm from the carina. Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities are again noted, most dense in the left mid lung and in the retrocardiac region silhouette the descending thoracic aorta, new from prior. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged likely exaggerated by portable technique and low lung volumes. No acute osseous abnormalities.
