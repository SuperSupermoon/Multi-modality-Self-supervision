AP chest compared to ___, ___:15 p.m.: Tip of the new intra-aortic balloon pump ends slightly above the upper margin of the left main bronchus and the anticipated location of the aortic knob which is obscured by a large lung mass. Lung volumes have improved and there is much better aeration at the right lung base, presumably improvement in dependent edema and atelectasis, but the left lower lobe remains consolidated or collapsed. An ascending flotation catheter ends in the right pulmonary artery. There is no pneumothorax. Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
