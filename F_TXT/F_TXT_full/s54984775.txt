1. Right subclavian central line and endotracheal tube are unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There are bilateral layering effusions with patchy airspace process at both bases, essentially without significant interval change. In addition, the pulmonary vasculature appears less well defined on current examination, likely reflecting superimposed pulmonary and interstitial edema. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged. No pneumothorax. Left subclavian PICC line unchanged in position.
