As compared to the previous radiograph, the PICC line has been pulled back. The line is now in correct position, with the tip projecting over the inflow tract of the right atrium. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, with small lung volumes, moderate cardiomegaly, atelectasis at both lung bases, left more than right, and likely small left pleural effusion.
