A tracheostomy tube is in place. The right IJ central line is again noted, with tip overlying the proximal SVC. Previously seen left IJ line has been removed. Better seen on today's exam is tubing or catheter overlying the right lung base extending along the right side of the mediastinum. No pneumothorax detected. Cardiomediastinal silhouette, with widened superior mediastinum, is grossly unchanged. Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes again noted. Again seen is vascular plethora, and CHF, possibly slightly more pronounced. There is increased opacity at both lung bases, with probable right and possible left effusion, also similar to the prior study. Balloon from GI tract tube noted in left upper quadrant.
