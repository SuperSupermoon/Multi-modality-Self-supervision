There is slight diffuse hazy opacification of the lungs along with mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and cardiomegaly. These findings suggest mild pulmonary edema secondary to cardiac decompensation. The lungs are hyperinflated. There is no pleural effusion. An 8mm right upper lobe opacity could be a lung nodue. Recommend followup imaging with CT. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
