In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5.2 cm above the carina. Right subclavian catheter tip is in the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. The opacification at the left base is less prominent, consistent with a combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid at the left base. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. The atelectatic changes at the right base are somewhat less prominent.
