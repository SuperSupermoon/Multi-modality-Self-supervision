One AP portable view of the chest. A left-sided pigtail catheter has been pulled back and the tip now ends in the mid-to-lower hemithorax. No pneumothorax is identified. There are low lung volumes. There is slightly more fluid in the minor fissure on the right. Previously seen left lower lobe contusion is unchanged.
