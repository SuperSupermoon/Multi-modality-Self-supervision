Single portable view of the chest. Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam with secondary to crowding of the bronchovascular markings. The lungs are clear of confluent consolidation or large effusion. Calcific density again projects over left mid lung. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but given differences in technique and inspiratory effort has not changed. Increased fullness with an unusual contour again seen at the left hilum.
