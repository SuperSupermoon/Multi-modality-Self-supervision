There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube with the tip terminating approximately 6.1 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube tip courses below the diaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film. Study is limited due to patient rotation. Worsening opacification of the right lung base is noted and may be attributable to patient rotation. There may be a small right pleural effusion. The left costophrenic angle is not included in this exam. Streaky left basilar opacity also persists. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No pneumothorax is identified.
