Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates the patient to be rotated to the left. The heart is top normal in size, but likely accentuated by AP technique. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is dense retrocardiac opacity which could represent dependent atelectasis, accompanied by a small left pleural effusion. The right base similarly demonstrates streaky opacities, likely atelectasis. There is also a small pleural effusion on the right. There is no pneumothorax.
