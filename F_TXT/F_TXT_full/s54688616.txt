Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There continues to be perihilar opacity with some improvement in aeration in the right upper and lower lung suggestive of radiation fibrosis making superimposed infection less likely. Two right basilar chest tubes remain in place. There is a small right apical pneumothorax. Subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral chest wall is again seen. No pulmonary edema. No large effusions. Hardware overlying the mid to lower cervical spine.
