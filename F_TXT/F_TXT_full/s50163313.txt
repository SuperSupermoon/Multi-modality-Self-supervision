The endotracheal tube in the low trachea approximately 2 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube can be traced to the mid chest, but cannot be traced further. The lung volumes are low. There is vascular engorgement and diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities, most consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. There is no definite pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal contour is widened, which may be due to technique, although acute aortic dissection is a consideration. The heart size is mildly enlarged.
