The endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina. A left subclavian CVL terminating at the upper SVC is unchanged in position. There is a new orogastric tube coiled within the stomach, which is now less distended. A left thoracostomy tube is unchanged in position. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The lung volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. Bibasilar atelectasis is again seen, slightly worse on the left.
