Lung volumes are substantially lower today following extubation increasing mediastinal widening to some extent, although there is still reason to consider mediastinal hemorrhage. Mild pulmonary edema is exaggerated by exceedingly low lung volumes and reflected in severe left lower lobe atelectasis. Bilateral pleural effusions are small. No pneumothorax. The left pleural drainage catheter and midline drains are still in place. Right subclavian line ends in the right atrium. No evidence of pneumothorax. Left PIC line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
