Right-sided subclavian line has been pulled back with the tip in the low SVC. In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little overall change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with a dual-channel pacer with leads extending to the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle. No change in the degree of pulmonary edema and the bilateral layering pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases, worse on the right. The right rib fractures are difficult to see on this study, but there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
