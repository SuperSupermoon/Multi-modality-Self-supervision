Increased, moderate left pleural effusion shifts the mediastinum rightward and obscures some of the left lung base, but atelectasis if any, is secondary to, not the cause of the effusion which could be empyema, other exudate, or under the appropriate circumstances, hemothorax. Mild edema is present in the left lung, but there is no appreciable right pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette is larger and a pericardial effusion might be present.
