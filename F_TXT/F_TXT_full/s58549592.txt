The inferior aspect of the left hemithorax is not fully included on the image. Given this, small bilateral pleural effusions are difficult to exclude, as is left basilar atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and not fully imaged. The mediastinal contours are stable. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
