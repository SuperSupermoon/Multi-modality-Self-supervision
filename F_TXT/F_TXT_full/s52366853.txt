Comparison is made with prior study of ___. ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes. The cardiac size is top normal. Bibasilar opacities are a combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis. These are better seen in prior CT from ___. Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved. Mild pulmonary edema has improved. New right upper lobe opacities are consistent with atelectasis, attention in this area should be paid to exclude developing lung abnormality/infection.
