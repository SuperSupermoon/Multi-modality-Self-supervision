Left PICC terminates at the level of the right tracheobronchial angle, approximately 5 mm from the expected junction with the superior vena cava. The catheter makes a more tortuous course within the previously present left PICC line within the brachiocephalic vein. Additional lateral CXR view may be helpful to determine the precise location and to exclude malpositioning within alternative vascular structures. However, upon phone communication with IV therapy nurse ___ at 3:25 pm on ___, it was revealed that the PICC has been replaced and has been re-evaluated by a new CXR that is dictated separately under clip ___. Pre-existing right-sided vascular catheter is unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Interval resolution of right pleural effusion and adjacent basilar atelectasis, as well as partial clearance of left retrocardiac atelectasis. Persistent small left pleural effusion.
