Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient positioning. There is patchy retrocardiac opacity with associated air bronchograms which may represent an area of pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage given the patient's history of hemoptysis. Clinical correlation is advised. There is possibly a small left effusion. Right lung is grossly clear. No pneumothorax.
