In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the IABP tip lies just above the left mainstem bronchus. There is increased opacification at the left base most likely consistent with atelectasis and effusion, however, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. The nasogastric tube extends at least to the lower stomach, where it crosses the inferior margin of the image. There is a right Swan-Ganz catheter that extends beyond the mediastinal confines. It could be pulled back several centimeters. Endotracheal tube remains in good position and the stimulator device remains in place.
