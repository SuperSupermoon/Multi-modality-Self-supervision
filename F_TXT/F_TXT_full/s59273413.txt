Single AP upright portable view of the chest is obtained. Midline tracheostomy is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. There has been interval decrease in previously seen bilateral opacities with possible mild left base atelectasis/residua. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. A left-sided PICC is seen, distal tip not well seen but likely in the region of the low SVC/cavoatrial junction. What appears to be dense contrast is seen projecting over the gastric fundus.
