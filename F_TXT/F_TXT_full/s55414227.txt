There are no more pronounced right upper lobe changes when compared to the prior radiographs, probably reflecting interval improvement in the other areas relative than any worsening in this area. There remains some bronchial wall thickening, mild widening of the right paratracheal stripe suggested some localized lymphadenopathy and patchy changes in the left base in particular. There are no effusions and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
