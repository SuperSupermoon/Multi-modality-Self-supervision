The thoracic aorta is tortuous and calcified. Direct comparison to previous radiographs is somewhat limited due to positional changes, but the lateral aspect of the aortic knob contour appears further displaced from the aortic intimal calcifications compared to previous studies. This is nonspecific but may be associated with aortic dissection. Given the clinical suspicion for this entity, further evaluation with dedicated chest CTA is suggested as communicated to Dr. ___ by telephone on ___ at 4:45 p.m. at the time of discovery. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable in size. Left hemidiaphragm is elevated with adjacent atelectasis and small pleural effusion. Questionable small right pleural effusion.
