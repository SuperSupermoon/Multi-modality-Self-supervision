Right PICC has been re-positioned, now terminating in the lower superior vena cava. Stable radiographic appearance of cardiomediastinal contours. Improved aeration at left lung base with near resolution of left basilar atelectasis, and persistent small left pleural effusion. However, a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has increased in size with adjacent increasing opacity that likely reflects atelectasis.
