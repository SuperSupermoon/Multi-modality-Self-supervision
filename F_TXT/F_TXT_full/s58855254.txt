Comparison is made with prior study ___. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. Right PICC tip is in the right atrium, can be withdrawn 1-2 cm for more standard position. New right lower lobe opacities are a combination of small effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Given the clinical suspicion of aspiration, this cannot be totally excluded. Left lower lobe opacities consistent with a large area of atelectasis and small effusion are unchanged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged.
