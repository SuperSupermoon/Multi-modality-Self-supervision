There is markedly improved aeration of the left lung, which was previously completely collapsed, with some residual partial left lower lobe atelectasis remaining. Bilateral moderate layering pleural effusions result in veil-like opacities in the mid and lower lungs, and there is associated adjacent atelectasis at the bases. Relative hyperlucency of the upper lobes is consistent with known emphysema documented on previous CTs. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, which continued cephalad position of feeding tube tip in the proximal stomach.
