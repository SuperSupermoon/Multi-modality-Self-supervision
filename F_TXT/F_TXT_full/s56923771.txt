Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. A right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter is seen terminating at the cavoatrial junction/right atrium. Large left pleural effusion is again seen, grossly stable compared to prior study given differences in patient position. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with the left aspect of the cardiac silhouette not well assessed due to the large left pleural effusion. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The right lung is similar in appearance.
