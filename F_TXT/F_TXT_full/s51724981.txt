Compared to the previous radiograph, there is an improvement in lung volumes and a decrease in extent of the pleural effusions. The changes might reflect a combination between the true clinical improvement and increased ventilatory pressure. The size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally decreased. The monitoring and support devices are constant. No evidence of pneumonia. No overt pulmonary edema.
