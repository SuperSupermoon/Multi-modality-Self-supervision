Compared with earlier the same day, a right-sided pigtail catheter is now seen at the base of the right lung. No gross right-sided effusion is identified -- the previously suspected effusion is significantly decreased in size. No obvious right pneumothorax is detected. Minimal linear atelectasis at the right base is now visible, without other evidence of right base consolidation. On the left, the small effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation remains present. Some platelike atelectasis at the junction of the left middle lower zones is new. No pneumothorax is detected. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is either stable or slightly decreased in size, allowing for significant differences in degree of the patient rotation.
