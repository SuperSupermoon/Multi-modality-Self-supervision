Two left-sided chest tubes are unchanged in position. Right-sided PIC line terminates in the right atrium and if the location to be desired is the mid SVC, must be pulled back 2-3 cm. There appears to be slight interval increase in the bilateral areas of opacification at the lung bases, left greater than right. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
