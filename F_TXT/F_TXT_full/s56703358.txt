Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Moderate vascular congestion is stable. Bibasilar opacities have increased on the left. This could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Probably small effusions are unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Lines and tubes are in unchanged position.
