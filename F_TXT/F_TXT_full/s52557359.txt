There is a known right upper lobe mass with subsequent extensive parenchymal opacity. Loss of the paratracheal stripe suggests a mediastinal adenopathy. On the current image, there is no convincing evidence of pneumothorax. Loss of structure in the left upper lobe suggests pulmonary emphysema. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, no pleural effusions. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
