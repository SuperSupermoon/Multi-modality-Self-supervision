As compared to previous radiograph from earlier today, the left hemi thorax is now nearly completely opacified, likely due to worsening near-complete collapse of the left lung as well as a known coexist existing left pleural effusion with pigtail pleural catheter in place. Interval placement of right-sided chest tube with near resolution of right pleural effusion and development of a small lateral right pneumothorax. Large mass in the right apex is unchanged and has been more fully evaluated by a recent chest CT.
