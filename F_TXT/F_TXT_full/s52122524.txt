Cardiomegaly, enlarged main pulmonary trunk, and diffuse right greater than left lung opacities, findings favor moderate to severe pulmonary edema. Given asymmetry in lung opacity, pneumonia cannot be excluded. Followup PA and lateral radiographs are recommended after diuresis to evaluate for underlying infection and to reassess mediastinal and hilar contours to help differentiate engorged vessels from lymphadenopathy he sought.
