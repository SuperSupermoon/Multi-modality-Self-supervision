An endotracheal tube tip lies 3.1 cm above the carina. An enteric feeding tube courses below the diaphragm, out of field of view. A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter tip projects within the right atrium. There are persistent low lung volumes with worsening bibasilar atelectasis/partial collapse. There are no large pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable demonstrating a left ventricular configuration of the heart. The heart is within the upper limits of normal in size. Pulmonary vascularity is not increased. An endovascular aortic graft is demonstrated projecting over the mid upper abdomen.
