There are no old films available for comparison. The ET tube is 5 cm above the carina. The NG tube is in the stomach. There is a large amount of subcutaneous emphysema predominantly in the right lateral chest wall but also extending in the left neck. There is obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm with a large amount of volume loss to the right lower lobe and probable right middle lobe as well. There is hazy ill-defined vasculature suggesting an element of fluid overload. Increased lucency along the cardiac and mediastinal silhouette suggests an element of pneumomediastinum. The amount of lateral subcutaneous emphysema suggests that a pneumothorax is also present although one is not visualized.
