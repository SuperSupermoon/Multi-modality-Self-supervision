Compared to the prior study and allowing for differences in positioning, there is a small right to moderate pleural effusion which has probably increased in size, in with underlying atelectasis. There has been interval obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm. The right lung base catheter is again noted, though its relative position is difficult to evaluate. Increased retrocardiac density at the left base has increased, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion is also slightly larger. Doubt significant CHF. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged allowing for differences in positioning. Right upper quadrant TIPS catheter noted.
