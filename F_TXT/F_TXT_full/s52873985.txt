As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. Pre-existing signs of fluid overload are minimally less severe than on the previous image. The multifocal parenchymal opacities, notably at the lateral bases of the right upper lobe, in the right lower lobe and in the perihilar left-sided areas are unchanged. Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis persists.
