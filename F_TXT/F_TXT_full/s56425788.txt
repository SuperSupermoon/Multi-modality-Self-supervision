There are low lung volumes and a suboptimal inspiratory effort. Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits. Diffuse, centrally predominant interstitial opacities are consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no focal lung consolidation. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
