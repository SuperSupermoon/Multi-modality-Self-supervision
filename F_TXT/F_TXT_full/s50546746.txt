Again appreciated is a left subclavian dialysis catheter with the tip in an unchanged location in the right atrium. The cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouette is unremarkable. There is minimal left sided atelectasis and trace right sided pleural effusion. An IVC filter projects over the mid abdomen.
