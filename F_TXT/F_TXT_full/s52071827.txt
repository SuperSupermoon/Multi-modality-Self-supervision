Moderate left pleural effusion has enlarged since ___. Other findings in the chest are stable since ___. Small right pleural effusion or pleural thickening is stable, probably with a fissural component, despite the right basal pleural drain, which showed projects to the left of midline. I do not see any pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Tracheostomy tube is tilted slightly in rotated, but unchanged over the past several days. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC. Contrast agent is still present in the stomach, without clearing over at least 4 days.
