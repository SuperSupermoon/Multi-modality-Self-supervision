Lung volumes are low. The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with unfolding of the thoracic aorta again noted. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Mild atelectatic changes are noted within the left lung base. Cervical spinal fusion hardware and right shoulder arthroplasty are incompletely assessed on this exam. Previously noted right PICC has been removed.
