Widening of the upper mediastinum is shown to be due to increased mediastinal fat (mediastinal lipomatosis) and tortuous vessels on recent neck CT ___ ___. Heart size is normal. Hazy opacity in left cardiophrenic angle region probably represents an enlarged cardiac fat pad in the setting of mediastinal lipomatosis. Adjacent linear opacity at the left lung base favors atelectasis. Consider a standard PA and lateral chest x-ray to exclude the possibility of a small left pleural effusion when the patient's condition permits. Right lung and pleural surfaces are clear.
