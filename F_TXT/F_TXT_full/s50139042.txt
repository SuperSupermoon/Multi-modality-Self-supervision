ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Right IJ catheter tip is in the cavoatrial junction. There is no evident pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Bilateral left greater than right peribronchial consolidations are better seen on prior CT probably unchanged. Large right and small left pleural effusion associated with adjacent atelectasis and multiple bilateral lung masses and nodules were better evaluated on prior CT as well as multiple bone lesions (patient has known multiple myeloma).
