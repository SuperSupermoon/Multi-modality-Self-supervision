Right upper and lower lobe opacities are new since the prior day, with indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels, suggesting pulmonary edema. However, concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded, in the correct clinical setting. The right PICC line terminates in the lower SVC, and the ET tube terminates 4.5 cm above the carina. Unchanged calcified pulmonary granulomas in the left lung. No pneumothorax. Stable cardiomediastinal borders.
