As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung parenchyma shows no relevant change. The distributions, severity and extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities is constant. Also constant is the size and shape of the cardiac silhouette. The monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position, except for the Dobbhoff tube that has been advanced by approximately 10 cm. The second feeding tube appears to be in unchanged position. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
