Lung volumes are low. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. No focal consolidation. No pneumothorax. There is moderate central vascular congestion without evidence of overt pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis, as well as volume loss in the right upper lobe with ipsilateral tracheal deviation, consistent with prior right upper lobe VATS wedge resection. Mediastinal silhouette is widened, owing to an unfolded descending thoracic aorta. There is heavy calcification of the ascending aorta and aortic knob. Heart size is likely enlarged, though cannot be accurately assessed in the presence of bilateral effusions.
