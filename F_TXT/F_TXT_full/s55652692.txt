Compared with ___ at 01:19, the overall appearance is similar. Again seen is cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution. Also again seen is tenting of the left hemidiaphragm, with patchy retrocardiac opacity. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is slightly better seen, but also probably unchanged. Incidental note made of a probable subchondral cysts in the left glenoid and well corticated tapering of the distal right clavicle.
