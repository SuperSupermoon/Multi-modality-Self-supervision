1. Right internal jugular central line, nasogastric tube and an endotracheal tube are likely unchanged in position. There is persistent consolidation in the right upper lobe, left upper lobe and left lower lobe.

These findings more likely favor an acute infectious process given the change chronologically since ___. Cardiac and mediastinal contours cannot be assessed due to the presence of the bilateral airspace disease. No pneumothorax.
