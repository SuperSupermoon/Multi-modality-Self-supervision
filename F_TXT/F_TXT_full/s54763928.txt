Tracheostomy tube and feeding tube remain in place. Right subclavian catheter has been removed with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Dense left retrocardiac opacity with associated inferior displacement of hilum appears unchanged and most likely represents collapse of the left lower lobe. Adjacent small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is present. Linear atelectasis in the right perihilar region is present but remainder of right lung is grossly clear.
