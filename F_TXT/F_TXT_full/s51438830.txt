Comparison is made with prior study performed 10 hours earlier. There is no evident pneumothorax after right thoracentesis. Of note, evaluation of pneumothorax is limited in this supine portable view. If any, there is a trace residual right effusion. Moderate left effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged. Opacity medially located in the upper lobes bilaterally, right greater than left, is most likely due to atelectasis , attention to this area should be paid to exclude developing superimposed infection .
