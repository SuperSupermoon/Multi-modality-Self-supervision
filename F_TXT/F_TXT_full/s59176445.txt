The lung volumes are low. The heart is normal in size. The aortic arch is partly calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Streaky linear opacity projecting over the left mid lung suggests minor atelectasis or scarring that is unchanged. There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified. No rib fracture is identified in this single limited view. Mild-to-moderate rightward convex curvature is again centered along the lower thoracic spine.
