This examination is limited by low lung volumes and underpenetration. Given these limitations, there is likely mild pulmonary edema. There is blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally which relates to small bilateral pleural effusions. No focal consolidation is identified in the upper lobes. The cardiac silhouette cannot be fully evaluated.
