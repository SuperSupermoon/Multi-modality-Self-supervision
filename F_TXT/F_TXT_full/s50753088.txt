Two right-sided pulmonary lesions are again demonstrated. The suprahilar lesion measures approximately 2.4 x 2.7 cm. The infrahilar lesion measures 3.1 x 2.1 cm. Nodularity along the left lung base is likely due to atelectasis. Moderately-sized right pleural effusion. No sizable pleural effusion on the left. No pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. No evidence of subdiaphragmatic free air. Degenerative changes are noted in both shoulders.
