AP chest compared to ___:50 a.m.: Consolidation in the left mid lung has improved substantially, presumably atelectasis. Eversion of the left anterior diaphragmatic recess accompanied by subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall is good evidence of anterior pneumothorax. Left anterior rib fractures are demonstrated to better advantage on subsequent chest radiographs. Right lung is clear. Heart size normal. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes to the distal portion of the nondistended stomach.
