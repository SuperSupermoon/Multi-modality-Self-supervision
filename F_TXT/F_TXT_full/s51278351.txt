Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. A stent within the aortic valve and aortic root is again noted. Lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation. As seen previously, there is diffuse ground-glass opacity within the lungs which could reflect the presence of pulmonary edema, though given findings on recent chest CT, differential includes chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. There is no pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures appear intact.
