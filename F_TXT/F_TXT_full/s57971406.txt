There appears to be interval improvement of the moderate right-sided pleural effusion. There is also evidence of a right-sided fissural loculation of pleural fluid. There is also improvement of the left-sided atelectasis. No new focal consolidations are noted. Again seen is the large pleural calcification which obscures the upper right lung. There is no pneumothorax. The Dobbhoff tube terminates below the diaphragm in the upper stomach. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. The hilar and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
