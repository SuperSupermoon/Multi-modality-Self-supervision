I am not sure whether projecting just above the level of the left axillary generator there is a left pneumothorax or an obliquely oriented margin of denser lung inferiorly due to previous left pleural drain, since removed. Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall is unchanged. Small left pleural effusion or pleural thickening is presumed. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic but there is no longer any vascular congestion. A large band of slowly resolving consolidation persists in the right lower Lung. No right pneumothorax or appreciable right pleural effusion. Transvenous right atrial and left ventricular pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in standard placements, continuous from the left axillary generator.
