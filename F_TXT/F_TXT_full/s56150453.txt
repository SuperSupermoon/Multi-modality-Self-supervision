No previous images. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with substantial pulmonary edema. In the appropriate clinical setting, widespread pneumonia or even ARDS could present a somewhat similar appearance. The tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to this stomach, with the side port at or just distal to the esophagogastric junction. The right IJ catheter probably extends to the upper portion of the right atrium. No evidence of pneumothorax.
