Comparison is made with prior studies ___. Widened mediastinum with evidence of neo-esophagus is unchanged. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated, is obscured by lung opacity in the right base. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities larger on the left side consistent with atelectasis are stable. There is mild vascular congestion. Right subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC. NG tube tip is below the diaphragm. Right chest tubes are in unchanged position. There is no evident pneumothorax.
