I do not see a radio-opaque pericardial drain, presumably removed since ___. Large cardiac silhouette is slightly larger, whether that is due to interval recurrence of pericardial effusion or worsened cardiomegaly is radiographically indeterminate. Substantial increase in opacification of the lung bases could be due in part to pleural effusion, moderate on the right small on the left, but raises concern for concurrent pneumonia in either lower lobe. Pulmonary vasculature is more engorged indicating a component at least of cardiac decompensation. No pneumothorax.
