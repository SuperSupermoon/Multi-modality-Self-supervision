Central venous catheter remains in a standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and without change. Bibasilar confluent opacities persist, involving the left lower lobe to a much greater degree than the right. Considering relatively rapid development and distribution, this most likely represents an aspiration pneumonia. A component of coexisting atelectasis is likely as well. As compared to the recent study, opacities have slightly worsened at both bases with associated increased obscuration of the hemidiaphragms, with complete lack of visibility on the left. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has also apparently increased in size.
