Comparison is made to prior study from ___. The Port-A-Cath, left IJ central line, left subclavian line, endotracheal tube, and feeding tube appear unchanged in position. An aortic stent is also seen. There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities throughout both lung fields, more confluent within the lung bases and within the right upper lobe. These appear stable. There are no pneumothoraces identified.
