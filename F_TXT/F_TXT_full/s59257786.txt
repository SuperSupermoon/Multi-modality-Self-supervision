The endotracheal tube terminates 5.4 cm from the carina, in satisfactory position. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and terminates within the stomach, however the side port is approximately at the level of the GE junction. This should be advanced 4-5 cm for optimal positioning. Single-chamber pacemaker lead projects in expected location. Bilateral interstitial opacities could represent volume overload or infectious process. Suggestion of nodularity in the right upper lung is better evaluated by same day chest CT. There is no pneumothorax. There may be a trace left pleural effusion.
