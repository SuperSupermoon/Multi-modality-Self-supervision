In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 6.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends into the stomach, with the side hole just distal to the esophagogastric junction. Another tube extending from at least the neck to the mid abdomen could represent a type of ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Increased opacification of the left spaces consistent with volume loss left lower lobe and small pleural effusion. The right lung is essentially clear. No evidence of vascular congestion.
