1. A single-lead right-sided pacer remains intact with the leads terminating over the expected location of right ventricle. There is increasing vascular congestion likely reflecting worsening mild pulmonary edema. In addition, there are likely layering small effusions, left greater than right, with some associated patchy airspace process likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. A superimposed infectious process would be less likely. No evidence of pneumothorax. There is a slightly asymmetric right apical pleural thickening which is unchanged since ___ and therefore likely reflects post-inflammatory changes. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
