Left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates at the right atrium, without evidence of pneumothorax. Left greater than right basilar reticular opacities could be due to atypical infection, but pulmonary hemorrhage is not entirely excluded given patient history. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
