Since the radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there has been a small amount of improvement in aeration of the mid left lung and at the large, mid left lung opacity corresponding to the patient's known mass is better appreciated. The small, loculated, left pleural effusion appears grossly unchanged. Bilateral interstitial edema has decreased. There is no pneumothorax. Subcutaneous emphysema of the left chest wall and left neck has decreased. The left-sided pigtail catheter and left lower lung pleural drainage catheter are unchanged in position.
