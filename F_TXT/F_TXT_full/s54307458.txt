Comparison is made with prior study performed one day earlier in the morning. Multifocal opacities in the right lung are unchanged, the component of atelectasis in the right base has minimally improved. The density of the left lung has minimally increased. This could be due to pleural effusion or a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Otherwise, the appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette that is shifted towards the left side, the left hilar mass and the postobstructive consolidations is unchanged. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
