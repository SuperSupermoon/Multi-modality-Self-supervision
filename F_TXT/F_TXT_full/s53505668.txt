Lung volumes are slightly lower, particularly on the right. Left chest tube is unchanged. Left perihilar consolidation is increased since the prior study, likely reflecting atelectasis. Previous moderate left pleural effusion is smaller and the heterogeneous opacity at the left lung base is likely a combination of atelectasis and edema. Increasing opacities at the right lung base may reflect a developing pneumonia.
