In comparison with the study of ___, there are improved lung volumes. The endotracheal and nasogastric tubes have been removed, as has the Swan-Ganz catheter, which has been replaced with a right IJ sheath. Bibasilar atelectatic changes are again seen, with obscuration of left hemidiaphragm consistent with substantial volume loss in left lower lobe. No evidence of pneumothorax. Little change in the appearance of the mediastinum. However, if there is serious clinical concern for hemorrhage postoperatively, CT would be the next imaging procedure.
