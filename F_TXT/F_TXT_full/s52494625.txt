1. Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position. There are postoperative changes in the right upper and mid lung. Overall, there is some interval improvement in aeration in both lower lobes suggesting that pulmonary edema is improving. There are persistent bibasilar opacities, however, which either reflect persistent pulmonary edema or an infectious process. Multiple calcified hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are seen, consistent with prior granulomatous infection. Biapical pleural thickening with left apical pleural calcifications are stable. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient positioning. Small layering bilateral effusions. Lung hyperinflation consistent with underlying emphysema. The heart remains enlarged. No appreciable pneumothorax.
