Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis appear stable. There is central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt edema. A right PICC terminating at the lower SVC, right IJ catheter terminating at the mid SVC, endotracheal tube terminating 6.3 cm above the carina, and orogastric tube extending to at least the level of the stomach are unchanged in position. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stable since ___.
