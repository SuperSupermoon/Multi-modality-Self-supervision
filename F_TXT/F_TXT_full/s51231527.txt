Moderate right and small left pleural effusions with pulmonary vascular redistribution consistent with decompensated congestive heart failure. Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. No rib fracture is seen, although the technique is quite limited. If there is further clinical concern, please obtain dedicated a rib series.
