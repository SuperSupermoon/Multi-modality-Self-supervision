A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates surgical sutures and volume loss in the right upper lobe, consistent with the patient's prior history of lobectomy. The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD. The lungs, however, are clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The aorta is stably tortuous, and the heart size is normal. Pulmonary vascularity is normal, and there is no pulmonary edema.
