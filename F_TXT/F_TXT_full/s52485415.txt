Since the prior study there has been no change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette including cardiomegaly and mediastinal widening but there has been interval development of interstitial pulmonary edema, moderate. There is no substantial increase in pleural effusion. No interval development of pneumothorax is present. Slightly more asymmetric appearance of the edema involving left lower lung more than the right lower lung might be consistent with coexisting infection but reassessment after diuresis is required.
