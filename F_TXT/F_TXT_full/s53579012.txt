The cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Linear opacities within the left lung base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
