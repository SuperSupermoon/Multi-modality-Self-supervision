New collapse of the left upper lobe around a large, obstructing, left hilar mass explains leftward shift of the mediastinum and elevation of the left lung base though subpulmonic pleural effusion is probably also present, and aeration of the left lower lobe is poor, probably also due to bronchial obstruction. Patient has had right upper lobectomy. There may be a small right pleural effusion. There is no evidence for pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
