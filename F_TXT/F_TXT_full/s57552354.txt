1. Tracheostomy tube, left subclavian PICC line, feeding tube and left chest tube remain unchanged in position. 2. Persistent left lower lobe airspace consolidation is essentially stable but may reflect atelectasis versus pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. Left lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is essentially unchanged. No definite pneumothorax is seen although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
