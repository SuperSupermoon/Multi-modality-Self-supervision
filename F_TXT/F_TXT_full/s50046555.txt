In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the IABP again is at the superior aspect of the transverse arch of the aorta. It would be necessary to pull it back approximately 3 cm to be at 8 point midway between the transverse arch of the aorta and the left mainstem bronchus. The left hemidiaphragm is not well seen medially and there is increased opacification in the retrocardiac region, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. Otherwise, little change.
