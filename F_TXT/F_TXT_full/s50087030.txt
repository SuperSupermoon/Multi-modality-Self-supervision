CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with the earlier film, I doubt significant interval change. Heart size is borderline or slightly enlarged. There is hazy opacity along the left lung, more pronounced peripherally, and subsegmental atelectasis at the right base, similar to the prior film. No gross effusion is identified. Advanced degenerative changes of both shoulders is suggested.
