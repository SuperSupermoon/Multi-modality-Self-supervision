Right-sided chest tubes are again seen. There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Right upper chest region of loculated gas is again seen, grossly stable in extent. There has been interval increase in adjacent right upper lung opacity which may be due to underlying pleural effusion and consolidation with possible component of collapse without shift of the mediastinum. The left lung is grossly clear aside from minor basilar atelectasis. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the right aspect difficult to fully assess due to the right-sided opacities. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is again seen tracking along the right chest wall and into the right neck.
