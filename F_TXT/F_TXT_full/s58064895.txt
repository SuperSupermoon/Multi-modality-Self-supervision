Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. A large bore right-sided central catheter is seen terminating in the proximal right atrium/cavoatrial junction. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Left base opacity is seen, with obscuration of the diaphragm concerning for a pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. There is also hazy opacity at the right lung base, which could relate to layering effusion with atelectasis; however, consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting in either lung base.
