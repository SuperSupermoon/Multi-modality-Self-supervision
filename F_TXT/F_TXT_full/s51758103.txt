Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained. No pneumothorax is seen. The lungs appear well expanded with right infrahilar mass redemonstrated. Thin linear density projecting within this lesion may reflect the fiducial marker though it is not well seen. Cardiac size and tortuous aortic contour are unchanged.
