A new endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, approximately 4 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. The lung volumes are low, accentuating the bronchovascular structures. There is no large airspace opacity, pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
