As compared to the previous radiograph, the opacity, likely of infectious origin, located in the left lower lobe, has increased in density but not in extent. There is increasing accompanying atelectasis of the left lower lobe. The right lung base appears slightly denser than on the previous radiograph, which, might be caused by partial atelectasis of the middle lobe, given a deviation of the minor fissure. No pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
