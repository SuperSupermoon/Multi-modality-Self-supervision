Clips in the right axillary region are compatible with prior dissection. Endotracheal tube tip sits between the clavicular heads. Two endogastric tubes course inferiorly into the stomach and out of field of view. A right-sided IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip sits in the main pulmonary artery. Left-sided IJ central venous catheter sits at the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC. Midline sternotomy wires and prosthetic valve as well as mediastinal clips appear unchanged. The cardiomediastinal contours are large but stable compared to prior study. The lungs demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis as well as increasing pulmonary edema, moderate. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also likely present. There is no pneumothorax.
