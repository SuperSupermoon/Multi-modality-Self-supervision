Frontal chest radiograph is markedly rotated to the right side. Thoracic scoliosis also limits the study. Extensive pleural calcifications throughout the right hemithorax are of unknown chronicity. Additionally, a pleural effusion is likely present on the right, but the size is difficult to determine due to positioning. The left lung is clear and there is no pneumothorax. Heart size is not well evaluated due to patient positioning. Superior subluxation of the right glenohumeral joint is noted.
