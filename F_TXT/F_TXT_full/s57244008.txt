AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. The patient remains intubated, the ETT terminating in unchanged appropriate position. Also unchanged are the previously described right-sided subclavian approach central venous line, a left-sided internal jugular approach wide-bore catheter terminating in the superior SVC and unchanged position of NG tube. The heart size appears unchanged. The pulmonary vascular pattern has not undergone any significant interval change. What we see now evidence of right-sided pleural effusion occupying the pleural space along the lower right lateral chest wall. Increased of diffuse haze over the right lower hemithorax suggests that the pleural effusion extends also in the posterior compartment. The amount of right-sided effusion appears to have increased in comparison with the next study of ___, but appears to be about the same as observed on chest examination of ___.
