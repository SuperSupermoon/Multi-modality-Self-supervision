Overall cardiac contour appears somewhat smaller than on previous study in this patient status post pericardiocentesis for a pericardial effusion. There continued to be layering bilateral effusions with associated bibasilar airspace opacities, which most likely represent partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There is cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension but no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Overall mediastinal contours are stable.
