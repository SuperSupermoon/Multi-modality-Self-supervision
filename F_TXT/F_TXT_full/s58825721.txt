The heart is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable within limitations of technique. There is no evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a hazy right basilar opacity, possibly developing pneumonia versus atelectasis. Projecting over the left mid lung are two suspected small discrete nodules. Streaky basilar opacities may be due to minor atelectasis. The bones appear demineralized.
