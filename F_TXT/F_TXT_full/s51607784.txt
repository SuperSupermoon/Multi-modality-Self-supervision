There are new reticular markings diffusely throughout both lungs likely reflecting pulmonary interstitial edema. There are increased right basilar opacities as well as a stable opacification in the right upper lung zone which likely corresponds to the previously described right upper lobe mass. No left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax identified. The size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
