Lung volumes are low with bronchovascular crowding. Retrocardiac opacity with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm and left costophrenic angle may reflect atelectasis and/or infection in the appropriate clinical situation. A left pleural effusion is small. Right lung is clear except for minor atelectasis at the base. Aortic knob calcifications are moderate. No pneumothorax.
