There has been interval placement of bilateral chest tubes. A small left-sided pneumothorax is noted. The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right-sided central venous catheters are in unchanged position. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There is significant improvement in pulmonary edema with near resolution of left mid lung opacity. Post chest tube placement, bilateral pleural effusions have decreased significantly in size.
