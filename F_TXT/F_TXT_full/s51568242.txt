As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Low lung volumes. Unchanged position of the left internal jugular vein catheter and the endotracheal tube. Small bilateral pleural effusions with retrocardiac and right basilar atelectasis. Coexisting pneumonia, however, cannot be excluded. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No new parenchymal opacities.
