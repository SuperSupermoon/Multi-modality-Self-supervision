AP chest compared to ___: Lungs were clear on ___ but on ___ showed large scale multifocal consolidation, particularly pronounced in the left lung, worsening over the course of the day. Subsequently, the consolidation has not improved, presumably multifocal infection, but a mild component of pulmonary edema has decreased. There is no substantial pleural effusion. Hyperlucency projecting over the left diaphragmatic region should be investigated on upright chest radiograph when feasible to exclude anteriorly collected pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged at 10:45am as soon as the findings were recognized.
