There is moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly that is increased compared to the study from earlier the same day with pulmonary vascular re-distribution, perihilar haze and some alveolar infiltrates, lower lobe greater than upper lobe. There is a small left effusion. It is difficult to tell if a right effusion is present. There is dense retrocardiac opacity. The overall impression is that of CHF that has worsened in the interval.
