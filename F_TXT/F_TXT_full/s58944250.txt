There are both wide-bore and small-caliber pigtail catheters projecting over the left hemithorax, corresponding to pleural drainage tubes. Despite their presence, however, there is rightward shift of mediastinal structures and a lucent appearance to the lower left hemithorax suggesting the presence of a persistent pneumothorax. The patient is intubated with the endotracheal tube terminating approximately 4 cm above the carina. A orogastric tube passes into the stomach, including its sidehole, while its distal course is not well visualized. Medial right lower lung opacity suggests extensive atelectasis which may contribute to rightward shift of mediastinal structures, which is substantial. There is a suspected pleural effusion about the apex of the right lung or perhaps pleural thickening. A small quantity of left lateral subcutaneous emphysema is noted in conjunction with presence of chest tubes. There is no definite fracture visible on radiography.
