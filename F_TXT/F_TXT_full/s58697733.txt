An endotracheal tube, nasoenteric catheter, and left subclavian central venous catheter are in standard expected unchanged position. Linear opacities within the lung bases are unchanged and consistent with plate-like atelectasis. There is new mild pulmonary vascular congestion and new blunting of the right costophrenic angle, worrisome for mild volume overload. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax.
