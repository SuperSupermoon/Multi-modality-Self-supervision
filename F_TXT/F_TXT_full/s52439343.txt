Study is limited by lordotic positioning. Lung volumes remain low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Minimal patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
