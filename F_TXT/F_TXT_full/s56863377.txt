As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been advanced, the tip is not projecting approximately 4 cm above the carinal. The other monitoring and support devices, including the left chest tube, are in unchanged position. The millimetric pre-existing left pneumothorax is no longer visible. Atelectatic parenchymal opacities, both at the left and the right lung base are not substantially changed. Minimal left pleural effusion causes blunting of the left costophrenic sinus. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
