A right basilar pigtail catheter remains in place. No pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi erect technique. There continues to be more focal nodular opacity in the right mid to lower lung as well some lateral pleural thickening, which when correlated with the CT dated ___, appears to predominantly correspond to a multiloculated pleural fluid collection and combination of atelectasis and pneumonia. Lung volumes remain low. Linear opacity in the left base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
