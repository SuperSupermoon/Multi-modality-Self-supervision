Portable chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral low lung volumes with interval resolution of pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis is evident as well as bandlike atelectasis in the right upper lobe and retrocardiac region. Cardiomegaly is stable. The appearance of widened mediastinum is decreased compared to prior study and is likely exaggerated by low lung volumes.
