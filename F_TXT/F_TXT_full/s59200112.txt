The new right PICC tip projects in the proximal right atrium, 7.8 cm below the carina. It should be withdrawn approximately 2-2.5 cm for optimal placement. Tracheostomy tube and left subclavian catheter tip are unchanged in position. The large layering left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and right lower lobe atelectasis are unchanged from the prior study. There is probably a small right pleural effusion. The heart appears mildly enlarged. No new focal consolidation or pneumothorax detected.
