In comparison with the study of ___, the tracheostomy and right subclavian catheters are unchanged in position. The Dobbhoff tube appears to have shifted, with it extending into the lower body of the stomach, then coiling back on itself so that the tip lies several centimeters below the esophagogastric junction and pointing upward. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist. The left hemidiaphragm is now not seen, consistent with worsening volume loss in the left lower lobe and possible pleural effusion.
