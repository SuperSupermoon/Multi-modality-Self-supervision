A Dobbhoff catheter is not seen on this image. An enteric catheter with the appearance of a standard nasogastric tube courses into the left upper quadrant with side port projecting just distal to the expected location of the gastroesophageal junction. Tracheostomy is in standard position. Moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and small left pleural effusion persist. Heart and mediastinal contours are stable. Left PICC appears similarly positioned. No pneumothorax is evident. Lung volumes are low with bibasilar atelectasis. Clips and other hardware project over the upper and mid-abdomen.
