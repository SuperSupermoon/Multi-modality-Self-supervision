Left PICC has been removed. The lungs are clear aside from bibasilar atelectasis with right greater than left pleural effusions which appears more conspicuous on the right though this could be due to positioning. Heart size is mildly enlarged with calcification of the aortic knob noted. Cholecystectomy clips and plastic CBD stent are noted in the upper abdomen but incompletely assessed.
