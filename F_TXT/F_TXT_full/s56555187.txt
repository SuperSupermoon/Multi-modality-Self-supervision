Lung volumes are low. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is present. Compared with prior chest radiograph there is a new confluent opacity in the right lower lung, obscuring some portions of the right hemidiaphragm margin. The left lung is clear. There may be a small layering pleural effusion in the right and chronic pleural thickening is redemonstrated. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Severe S type scoliosis is again seen and not significantly changed from prior. Cardiac size cannot be assessed in this AP view but appears stable compared with ___.
