In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is a large loculated left pleural effusion. Perihilar airspace opacity persists on the left, consistent with re-expansion edema. Mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure is seen in this patient with substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. There may be a small residual left apical pneumothorax.
