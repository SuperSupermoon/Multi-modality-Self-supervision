As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have minimally decreased. Nevertheless, the right lung bases is better ventilated than on the previous image.

Short-term radiograph followup should be performed to rule out developing pneumonia. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. Unchanged course of the left-sided PICC line.
