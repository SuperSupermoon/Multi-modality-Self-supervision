In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the lower body of the stomach. The tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 2.6 cm above the carina. Continued low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Little if any vascular congestion. Some retrocardiac opacification is most consistent with atelectatic changes and possible small effusion.
