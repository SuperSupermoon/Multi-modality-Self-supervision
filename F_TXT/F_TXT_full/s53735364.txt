Left lower lobe collapse and moderate bilateral pleural effusion has both probably improved since earlier in the day. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic and pulmonary vascular engorgement is persistent. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube ends at the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 2 cm from the carina, but probably 3 or 4 cm above the carina, distorted by patient position. Right central venous line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. Nasogastric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
