Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate well-expanded lungs. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle due to some pleural thickening and likely small pleural effusion. Chest radiograph is otherwise essentially unchanged from prior imaging. There is some slight atelectasis at the right base. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is again seen. There is mild cardiomegaly which is stable.
