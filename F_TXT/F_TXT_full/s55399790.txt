Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day at 3:50 p.m. The left chest tube has been slightly repositioned. There is interval substantial decrease in the subcutaneous air, which is still sizable. The tracheostomy tip is approximately 4 cm above the carina. There is questionable pneumothorax, difficult to assess in the presence of subcutaneous air. Left lower lobe consolidation appears unchanged.
