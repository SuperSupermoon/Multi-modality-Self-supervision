Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.8 cm from the carina. Enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm and into the stomach, with tip off the inferior borders of the film. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is demonstrated. Mediastinal contour is prominent superiorly, likely due to supine positioning and low lung volumes. Bilateral perihilar opacities, more pronounced on the right, suggests moderate pulmonary edema. More focal opacity in the right upper lobe could reflect infection or aspiration. Layering right pleural effusion is also noted and there is likely a small left pleural effusion.No displaced fractures are demonstrated.
