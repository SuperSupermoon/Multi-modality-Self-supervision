1. Left subclavian central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. There is a nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. A second tube parallels the course of the first one and could reflect a second nasogastric tube with its tip overlying the stomach or may be extrinsic to the patient. Clinical correlation is advised. A catheter is also seen overlying the right mid abdomen. There continues to be bilateral effusions, right greater than left, and patchy airspace disease throughout both lungs. Overall, there has been improvement in aeration suggesting improving pulmonary edema. There continues to be a more consolidative process in the left base which could be related to the pulmonary edema or possibly represents partial lower lobe atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Continued followup imaging would be helpful. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax is appreciated. A somewhat elliptical opacity in the right mid lung may reflect loculated fluid within the horizontal fissure.
