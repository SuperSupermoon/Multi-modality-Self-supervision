Interval improvement but persistent mild pulmonary edema. There is more focal airspace consolidation at the left base which could reflect persistent lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered. There are layering bilateral effusions, left greater than right. Given patient's marked rotation, assessment of cardiac and mediastinal contours is not possible on the current examination. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
