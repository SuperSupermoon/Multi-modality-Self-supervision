There has been an increase in the bilateral pulmonary edema status post extubation as evidenced by increased dense opacification, which is now nearly confluent consistent with severe pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to evaluate given intervening pulmonary edema opacity, however appears unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. There has been complete obscuration of the costophrenic angles suggestive of bilateral pleural effusions. Right IJ catheter is unchanged in position and ends in the upper SVC. Sternotomy wires are unchanged in position, aligned along the midline with no evidence of sternal dehiscence.
