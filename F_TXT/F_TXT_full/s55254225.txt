Interval placement of a second left sided pleural catheter with introduction of some air within the pleural space consistent with a hydropneumothorax but no substantial change in opacification of the left hemithorax. Given the lack of improvement and when correlated with the CT dated ___, this likely reflects left lung collapse given the presence of debris filling the left mainstem bronchus on the recent CT study. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Bronchoscopy may be helpful. Patchy opacity at the right base is stable and could reflect an area of aspiration, pneumonia or atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. Right chest tube in place with stable small right apical pneumothorax. Status post median sternotomy with valve replacement. Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours, however, is difficult given the opacification of the left hemithorax.
