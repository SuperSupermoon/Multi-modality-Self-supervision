The nasogastric tube has migrated slightly more proximally with the sideport just at the GE junction. This could be advanced a few cm for more optimal placement. The left-sided Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position. There remains contrast material within the colon. There is unchanged mild cardiomegaly. There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Right upper lobe opacity may represent loculated fluid. There remains mild prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings. There are no pneumothoraces.
