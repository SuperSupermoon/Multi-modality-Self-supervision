Right subclavian central line, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right chest tube are unchanged in position. Lung volumes remain low with streaky opacities at both bases likely reflecting atelectasis. There is been decrease in the amount of right lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema, although there is now lucency within the right paratracheal region which may reflect pneumomediastinum or possibly a loculated medial pneumothorax. This can be better assessed on followup imaging. No pulmonary edema.
