AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained six hours earlier during the same day. Tracheostomy cannula remains in unchanged position. The same holds for multiple other devices and unchanged position is noted of the CoreValve typical grid structures in the left ventricular outflow tract-aortic valve area. Cardiac contours, sternotomy wire, and anterior chest wall stabilization device are unchanged. Left-sided pleural effusion obliterating diaphragmatic contour is unchanged. The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion is as before. No significant remaining pneumothorax can be identified on either side.
