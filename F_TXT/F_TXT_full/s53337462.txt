AP chest compared to ___: Changing contour of the right lung base is presumably an indication of decreased right pleural effusion due to interval thoracentesis. There is new focal opacity in the right upper chest at the level of the first anterior interspace. This could be loculated pleural fluid seen on the chest CTA ___. I don't see the region well enough to exclude pneumothorax, and therefore when feasible, conventional chest radiographs should be obtained. Heart is normal size. Left hemithorax unremarkable aside from mild basal atelectasis. The right lower lobe lung lesion, probably focal atelectasis, seen on the chest CT is also barely visible.
