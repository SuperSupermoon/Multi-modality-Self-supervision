NG tube can be followed up until mid esophagus, but its distal end is not clearly seen in this patient with known hiatal hernia. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are unchanged with bibasilar atelectasis. NG tube ends 2.5 cm above the carina. There is a new line coming from the abdomen, going to mid mediastinum.
