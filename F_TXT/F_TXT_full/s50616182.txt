There are diffuse bilateral airspace opacities. There is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, suggestive of a trace pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Mild perihilar vascular congestion is noted. Otherwise, hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is normal. There is thickening of the right minor fissure. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
