The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea. Two tubes extend to the gastric body. Low bilateral lung volumes. There are perihilar and diffuse airspace opacities as well as a more confluent opacity projecting over the peripheral left mid to lower lung zone. Right upper zone opacification is less confluent compared to prior. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. Heart size is unremarkable allowing for projection.
