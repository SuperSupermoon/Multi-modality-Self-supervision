Right internal jugular catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Heart is enlarged, and diffuse mediastinal and hilar widening are present, likely due to a combination of distended vessels and lymph node enlargement. Pulmonary nodules and masses have rapidly grown since the prior PET-CT with a dominant mass in the left lower lobe now measuring approximately 9 cm in diameter. New confluent opacities in the right perihilar and basilar region probably represent a combination of airspace disease and solid masses. . Note is also made of small bilateral pleural effusions which are apparently new from the prior PET-CT.
