Right hilar and suprahilar confluent opacity is nonspecific and could reflect an area of infection though underlying neoplasm cannot be excluded. Mild cardiomegaly is noted. Diffuse calcifications of the aorta is present. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. No large pleural effusion is noted, though a trace right pleural effusion may be present.
