AP chest compared to ___: The right hemidiaphragm became elevated between ___, even more pronounced today. Some of this could be due to subpulmonic pleural effusion but I would investigate either phrenic nerve palsy or complete right lower lobe and perhaps middle lobe collapse. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable with the mediastinum midline. A large cervicothoracic mass presumably a goiter displaces the trachea to the left. Left lung is clear. A left PIC line ends roughly at the origin of the SVC.
