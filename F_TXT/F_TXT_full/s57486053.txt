Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mediastinal contour is unchanged, with widening of the right paratracheal stripe compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy, not substantially changed in the interval. Hilar contours are obscured though likely enlarged due to lymphadenopathy. There is near-total opacification of the right lung, perhaps minimally increased compared to the previous radiograph, reflecting a combination of pulmonary metastases, right middle lobe collapse, and lymphangitic spread of tumor. Similar findings are also noted in the left lung, but are less pronounced, and this asymmetry again may be due to the presence of superimposed infection. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
