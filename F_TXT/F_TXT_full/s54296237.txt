AP chest compared to ___: Left lung base has been severely consolidated for days, presumably collapsed. Concurrent pneumonia is not excluded, of course. Lung volumes remain quite low and atelectasis would explain right infrahilar consolidation as well. Pulmonary vascular congestion and mediastinal venous engorgement attest to mild cardiac decompensation, probably worsened since ___. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. Right PIC line ends in the upper-to-mid SVC, transvenous pacer lead tip in the apex of the right ventricle. Aortic endoprosthesis in place from the arch to the level of the diaphragm. Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
