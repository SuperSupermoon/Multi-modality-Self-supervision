Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 05:00. There has been no interval change. Neither pneumothorax nor pleural effusion is evident in the right chest, with 2 apical thoracostomy tubes in place, despite severe subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall. Moderate right basal atelectasis persists in this patient with very severe emphysema. Nevertheless there is rightward mediastinal shift suggesting volume loss in the right lung is more severe ; the atelectasis appears to be entirely in the right lower lung.
