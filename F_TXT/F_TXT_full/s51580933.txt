The lung volumes are low, the lungs however are clear. Apparent cardiomegaly is likely secondary to low lung volumes. No pleural effusions. The newly placed enteric tube tip terminates in the expected location of the stomach in the left upper quadrant. There is persistent diffuse dilation of small and large bowel loops. Limited evaluation for free air on this single radiograph.
