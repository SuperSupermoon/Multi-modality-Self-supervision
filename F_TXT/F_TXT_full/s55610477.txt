A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes, with exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Even allowing for this, there is at least moderate cardiomegaly. Bilateral opacities are likely related sella mild to moderate vascular congestion and pulmonary edema, as well as atelectasis. This is similar to slightly increased compared to ___. Dense retrocardiac consolidation is likely related to edema, but superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded. There is no appreciable pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
