AP chest compared to ___: Substantial improvement in opacification in both lungs is due to at least decrease in moderate pulmonary edema. The heterogeneous almost nodular abnormality in the right lung is probably residual of pneumonia and when compared to ___, before the patient was in pulmonary edema, is somewhat better at the lung base, less so in the right mid and upper lung zones. Small bilateral pleural effusions have improved. Heart is normal size but pulmonary vasculature is still severely engorged. Transsubclavian right ventricular pacer lead is sharply angulated, an unusual orientation due to marked left ventricular enlargement and rotation counterclockwise of the interventricular septum.
