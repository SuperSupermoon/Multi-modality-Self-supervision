Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Again seen is an opacity in the right lower lung, which is similar to slightly improved from the prior study, and likely represents a combination of pleural effusion and pneumonia. Increased opacification at the left base is also concerning for pneumonia. Mild pulmonary edema is stable.
