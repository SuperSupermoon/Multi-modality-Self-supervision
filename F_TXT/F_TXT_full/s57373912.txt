A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. A chest tube overlies the right hemithorax. There is a tiny right basilar pneumothorax. Subcutaneous air in the right chest wall is expected after pleuroscopy and chest tube insertion. Volume loss and fibrosis in the right upper lobe are unchanged. The hyperexpanded right lower lobe and left lung are clear. No pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
