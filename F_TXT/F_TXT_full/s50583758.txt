Heart size is normal. The aorta demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications and unchanged mild tortuosity. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise within normal limits. Lungs remain hyperinflated with mild emphysematous changes again demonstrated. Small left pleural effusion appears not substantially changed in the interval with left basilar opacity likely reflective of compressive atelectasis. No large right pleural effusion is demonstrated, and no pneumothorax is detected. Dextroscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is again noted. Marked degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints as well as a narrowed right acromiohumeral interval is suggestive of rotator cuff disease. Remote right-sided tenth rib fracture is again noted.
