The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appears unchanged. There is an unchanged moderate pleural effusion on the right with associated right basilar atelectasis. A small pleural effusion on the left side also appears unchanged. Multifocal areas of reticulation are also similar to the prior study. Metallic stents project over the right upper quadrant.
