A new endotracheal tube ends at the right mainstem bronchus. A nasogastric tube terminates off of the radiograph. The right lung is clear. Near complete opacification of the left lung represents a combination of atelectasis and a small amount of pleural fluid. No pneumothorax is identified. There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm. Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal borders is limited due to the partial left lung collapse.
