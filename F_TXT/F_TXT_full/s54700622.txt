Severe pulmonary edema which worsened postoperatively has improved only slightly in the left upper lobe, persistent on elsewhere. Lung volumes are lower. Pleural effusions are larger, at least small, perhaps substantially larger. No pneumothorax. Heart is probably not enlarged. Widening of the upper mediastinum is probably due to venous engorgement. Indwelling ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach would need to be advanced several cm to move the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the main or proximal right pulmonary artery. Indwelling mediastinal and pleural drainage tubes unchanged in positions.
