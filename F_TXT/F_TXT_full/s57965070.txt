Given differences in projection and position with patient rotated the left, there has been no significant interval change. Degree of pulmonary edema which is moderate is unchanged. There is likely superimposed at least small right pleural effusion with blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle. Moderate cardiomegaly is similar compared to prior. No displaced fractures.
