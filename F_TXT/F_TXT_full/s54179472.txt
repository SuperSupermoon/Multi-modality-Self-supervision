A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates unchanged cardiac size. Increased diffuse bilateral opacity suggests mild pulmonary edema superimposed on known underlying interstitial lung disease. No definite focal consolidation is identified, although difficult to evaluate given overlying opacity. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Surgical clips project over the left axilla.
