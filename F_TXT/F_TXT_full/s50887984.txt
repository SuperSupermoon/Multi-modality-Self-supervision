The lungs are hyperinflated as on prior. Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggests small effusions as on prior. Coarse interstitial markings are seen throughout, likely due to chronic underlying lung disease. Calcified granuloma projects over the right upper lung medially, unchanged. There is no evidence of focal consolidation. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
