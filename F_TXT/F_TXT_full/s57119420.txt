There is no right pneumothorax or increase in the moderate residual and presumably loculated right pleural effusion following removal of the right basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter. Left pigtail pleural drainage catheter still in place. Left pleural effusion is small and there is no left pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascular congestion persists but previous mild pulmonary edema has improved. Cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged and bibasilar atelectasis persists, more severe in the left lung. Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. Feeding tube passes into the moderately distended stomach and out of view. Left jugular catheter ends at the origin of the SVC.
