Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is due to the presence of a right subcapsular complex hepatic fluid collection as seen on the CT. Small right pleural effusion is also demonstrated with associated mild right basilar atelectasis. Minimal left basilar atelectasis is also present. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement. There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
