1. Right internal jugular large-bore dual-lumen catheter with the most distal tip in the right atrium, right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip in the pulmonary outflow tract, and left-sided pacer unchanged. The heart remains enlarged despite marked patient rotation. There is increasing perihilar vasculature which is suggestive of worsening perihilar edema. There is likely layering left effusion. At least one old left-sided rib fracture is appreciated. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
