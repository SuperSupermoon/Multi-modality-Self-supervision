1. Interval increase in subcutaneous emphysema involving the neck soft tissues and right lateral chest wall. There is also a lucency in the left mediastinum raising concern for pneumomediastinum. Overall, there has been improved aeration at the left upper and mid lung, although there is persistent consolidation at the left base which may represent a partial lower lobe collapse versus pneumonia. Streaky opacities at the right base are likely unchanged since ___ and therefore may reflect scarring or subsegmental atelectasis. Right-sided remote rib fractures are again seen. A right internal jugular central line remains in place with its tip in the distal SVC. A right chest tube remains in place. No definite pneumothorax is seen. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
