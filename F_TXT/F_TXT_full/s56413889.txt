The NG tube has been advanced and is now in the stomach. There is an opacity in the right mid lung that is more apparent on the current study than on priors. It is unclear if this represents overlapping shadows, area of scar tissue, a new infiltrate or less likely a mass. Attention should be paid to this area on followup.
