Diffuse interstitial prominence with moderate cardiomegaly is consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. More linear area of focal consolidation within the right lower lobe is unchanged and is thought to reflect scarring/atelectasis. There is chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. While the patient has known mediastinal lymphadenopathy, this and mediastinal lipomatosis, are better appreciated on the prior CT. Clips within the left upper abdomen are unchanged.
