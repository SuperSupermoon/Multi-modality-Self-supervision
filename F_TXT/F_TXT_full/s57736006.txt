AP chest compared to ___: Tip of the right PIC line is at a level approximately 7.5 cm below the carina and could be withdrawn 3 cm for positioning low in the SVC. Bibasilar opacification is probably a combination of small pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis but one cannot exclude early pneumonia. Stomach is moderately to severely distended with air and fluid. Heart is borderline enlarged, but upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.
