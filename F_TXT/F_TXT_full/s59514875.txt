AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in comparison with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. Moderate cardiac enlargement similar as before. Comparison of the frontal views suggests that the mild blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses has regressed. No evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates can be found, and there is no pneumothorax in the apical area. Interval regression of mild pleural sinus blunting suggestive of regression of previously described CHF. Single view portable chest examination does not permit evaluation of pleural effusions that may remain in the posterior dependent pleural sinuses. No evidence of new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates is present. No pneumothorax is seen.
