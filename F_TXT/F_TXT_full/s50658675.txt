There is minor basilar atelectasis. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Mediastinal contours are sharp. Again, there is right paratracheal opacity without mass effect on the aorta, likely representing prominent vasculature. Degenerative changes are seen at the shoulder joints but not optimally evaluated on this study.
