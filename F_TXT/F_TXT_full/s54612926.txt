AP chest compared to ___: Severe widespread pulmonary consolidation has improved minimally radiographically, but since lung volumes are greater, the apparent improvement may reflect increased positive pressure ventilation, rather than clinical improvement. Mild cardiomegaly persists. Widespread pulmonary opacification likely non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is still quite severe. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. ET tube and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements. No pneumothorax.
