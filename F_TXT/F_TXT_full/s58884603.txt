Compared to the prior study, and allowing for technical differences, I doubt significant interval change. Low lung volumes are again present. Again seen is a tracheostomy tube, with considerable prominence the cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular plethora. Possibility of pericardial effusion has been previously raised. Probable increased retrocardiac density, similar to the prior film, though this is likely accentuated by underpenetration. No gross effusion.
