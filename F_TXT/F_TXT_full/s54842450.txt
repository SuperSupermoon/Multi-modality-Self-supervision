As compared to the previous image, no relevant change is seen. Moderate cardiomegaly, with the cardiac shape potentially suggesting pericardial effusion. Echocardiography could confirm this suspicion. The extent of the right basal parenchymal opacity and of the right pleural effusion is constant. No new parenchymal changes.
