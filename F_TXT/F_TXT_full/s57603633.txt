Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Widespread reticular and nodular opacities appear similar to the prior study, and have been more fully characterized on recent CT of one day earlier. A more focal opacity at the right lung base has slightly improved. Subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall is also slightly decreased.
