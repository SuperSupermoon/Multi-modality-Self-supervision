The patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach. The heart is probably at the upper limits of normal size, perhaps with a left ventricular configuration. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. The lung apices, particularly on the left, are partly excluded, but visualized lung fields appear clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
