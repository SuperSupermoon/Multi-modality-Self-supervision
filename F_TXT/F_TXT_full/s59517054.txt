The patient remains intubated, the ETT terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is incompletely visualized however the tip lies below the diaphragm. A right-sided PICC terminates in the distal SVC. The trachea is central, lung volumes remain slightly low. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged compared to the prior study. There has been progression of the atelectasis at the left lung base with a more linear appearance on the current study. Mild prominence of the pulmonary vascular likely reflects a degree of fluid overload. No pleural effusion seen. No pneumothorax seen.
