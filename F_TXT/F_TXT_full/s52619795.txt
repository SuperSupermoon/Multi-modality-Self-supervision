Lung volumes are low. The cardiac silhouette size remains mild to moderately enlarged. The mediastinal contour is stable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
