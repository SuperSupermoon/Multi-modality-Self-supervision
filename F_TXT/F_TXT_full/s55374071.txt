There is a right pectoral cardiac device with its leads in stable position projecting over the right atrium, right ventricle and left ventricle. The cardiac silhouette continues to be enlarged, and there is a left retrocardiac opacity, reflecting atelectasis and/or pleural effusion. Lower lobe opacities reflect worsening edema. There are surgical clips along the right neck.
