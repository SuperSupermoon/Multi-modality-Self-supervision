A chronic moderate right pleural effusion with probable associated atelectasis appears unchanged from prior examination. Diffuse interstitial opacities are stable and likely reflect chronic mild edema. Unchanged minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests a small left effusion as well. There is no pneumothorax. Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal contours is unchanged. The pacemaker generator and leads appear in standard position terminating in the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle.
