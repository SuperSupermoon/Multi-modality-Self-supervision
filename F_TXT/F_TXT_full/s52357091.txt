AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Previously identified right-sided PICC line remains in unchanged position terminating relatively low and apparently entering the upper portion of the right atrium. The heart size is unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested. Previously present Dobbhoff line has been removed. Considerable gas distended large bowel loops are seen in the left upper quadrant, a finding which existed already earlier. No evidence of free subdiaphragmatic air on either side on this portable chest examination. No pneumothorax in the apical area.
