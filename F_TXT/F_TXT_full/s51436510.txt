1. The nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube are no longer present. The right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter continues to have its tip in the right pulmonary artery. Improved aeration although persistent layering bilateral effusions with associated bibasilar airspace opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. The pulmonary vasculature now appears somewhat more ill defined and full suggesting a component of overlying perihilar edema. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with the heart being mildly enlarged. The aorta remains unfolded and tortuous. The stomach is distended with air.
