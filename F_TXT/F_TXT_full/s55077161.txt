In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung volumes. The left subclavian catheter is been pulled back to about the level of the cavoatrial junction. Otherwise, there is little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Opacification at the right base medially above the elevated hemidiaphragm could reflect crowding of vessels or atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered. Comminuted fracture of the right clavicle is again seen, as is a fusion device in the cervical spine.
