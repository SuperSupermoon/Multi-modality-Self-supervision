AP chest compared to ___: Although there is subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral chest wall and axilla, traversed by the left pleural tube that ends in the apex of the left hemithorax, I see no definite pneumothorax. New left rib fractures are presumably related to surgery. Increased caliber cardiomediastinal silhouette probably a combination of supine and AP positioning. Atelectasis at the right lung base moderately severe. Patient has had median sternotomy and mitral valve replacement.
