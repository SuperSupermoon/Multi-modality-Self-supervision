AP chest compared to ___, 9:07 a.m.: New endotracheal tube, tip no more than 12 mm above the carina. Overlying insufflation bulb should not be mistaken for a second internal device. Previous edema in the left lower lobe has improved. There is either very distended lower esophagus or hiatus hernia projecting to the left of the descending thoracic aorta, and perhaps to the right of the cardiac silhouette as well, although this could alternatively be a collapsed right lower lobe, as well as small right pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette is chronically severely enlarged. No pneumothorax.
