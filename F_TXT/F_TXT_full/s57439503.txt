Substantial worsening predominantly right-sided consolidation most readily explained by pneumonia. Mild edema has also developed, best appreciated in the left lung. . A second focus of pneumonia could be in the left lower lobe partially obscured by cardiac silhouette. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. No pneumothorax. Heart is top-normal size. Upper enteric drainage tube passes least as far as the distal portion of the nondistended stomach.
