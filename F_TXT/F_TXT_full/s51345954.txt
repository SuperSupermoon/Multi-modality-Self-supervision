1. Interval decrease in size of a left pleural effusion presumably related to recent thoracentesis. Clinical correlation is advised, however, as the requisition's clinical history said that the thoracentesis occurred on the right side. No pneumothorax. Improved aeration of the left base with residual streaky linear opacities suggestive of subsegmental atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Heart remains upper limits of normal in size. Mediastinal contours are stable.
