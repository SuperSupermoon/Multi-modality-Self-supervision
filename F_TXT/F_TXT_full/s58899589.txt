There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter with tip terminating at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. No pneumothorax is identified. Lung volumes remain low. Heart size remains moderately enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures remains. Patchy opacities in the lung bases are slightly worse in the interval and may reflect worsening atelectasis. No pleural effusion is present.
