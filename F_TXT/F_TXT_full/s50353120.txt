As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is noted. The bilateral, right more than left, parenchymal opacities, predominating in the mid and lower lung zones, are unchanged in extent and severity. No new opacities have occurred in the interval. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. The size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be at the upper range of normal but no evidence of pulmonary edema is seen. The monitoring and support devices, including the endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube, and the left subclavian access line are in unchanged normal position.
