Between ___, when the patient's chest radiograph showed multiple lung nodules and blastic bone lesions, and ___, the patient developed severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality accompanied by moderate bilateral pleural effusions. This might have been due entirely to pulmonary edema from heart failure, but disseminated carcinoma could mimic this appearance. The pulmonary process has progressed since ___, and the moderate pleural effusions are slightly larger, even though heart is normal size and there is no mediastinal vascular engorgement. In addition there are small fluid-filled spaces in the lung which could be bullae filled with fluid or cavitated nodules either malignant or infectious. Blastic metastasis is widespread in the chest cage.
