CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison. Possible hyperinflation/COPD. Mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration. Upper zone redistribution with mild vascular plethora, but no other evidence of CHF. Minimal atelectasis at both bases. No frank consolidation or gross effusion. Right paratracheal soft tissue density likely represents vascular structures, consistent with the findings on the ___ CT scan.
