Right internal jugular central line remains in place. Interval removal of the left chest tube and mediastinal drains. Interval improvement with near complete resolution of mild pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity remains at the left base likely reflecting atelectasis. No large pneumothorax is seen, although the patient was imaged in the semi-erect position lowering sensitivity for detection. Stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy.
