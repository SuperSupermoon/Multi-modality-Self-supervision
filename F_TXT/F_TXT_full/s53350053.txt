There are bilateral perihilar opacities, worse from yesterday. There is a new small to moderate left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are normal. Two vague opacities are appreciated in the left upper lung. The more conspicuous of which measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm, while the other measures at least 3 cm.
