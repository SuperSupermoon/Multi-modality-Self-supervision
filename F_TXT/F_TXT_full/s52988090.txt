AP chest compared to 3:23 a.m.: Right pneumothorax is moderate, decreased substantially since 3:23 a.m. following insertion of an obliquely oriented right pleural tube that extends from the lung base laterally to the hilus and mediastinum. Middle and lower lobe have partially reexpanded. The apical pleural tube is unchanged in position. ET tube, left internal jugular, right internal jugular catheters, and a nasogastric tube are in standard placements. Subcutaneous emphysema is extensive but probably improved. Heterogeneous opacification scattered in the left lung could be edema due to redirected blood flow but should be carefully monitored to exclude developing pneumonia, particularly at the base.
