In comparison with the study of ___, the hemidiaphragms are less well seen bilaterally, consistent with layering pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.

Increased opacification is also suggested in the right perihilar region. The cardiac silhouette is stable and there is no definite vascular congestion. Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
