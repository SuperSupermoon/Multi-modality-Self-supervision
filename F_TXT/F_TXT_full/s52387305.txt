Lung volumes are low, exaggerating cardiac silhouette and causing crowding of the bronchopulmonary vasculature. Heart size is normal with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. There is engorgement of the central pulmonary vasculature with increased interstitial lung markings compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. There is no clear focal consolidation suggestive of pneumonia. Pleural surfaces are clear without large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
