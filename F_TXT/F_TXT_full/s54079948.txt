The lung volumes are normal. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild bilateral basilar atelectasis. There is minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinuses, potentially caused by overlying soft tissues. However, a lateral radiograph would be helpful in excluding small pleural effusions. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
