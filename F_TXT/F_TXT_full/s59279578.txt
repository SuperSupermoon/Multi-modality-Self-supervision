An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position, terminating 2.1 cm from the carina. However, a right Swan Ganz catheter tip is malpositioned, located too far within the right lung periphery. Proximal repositioning by at least 4-5 cm is recommended. An intraaortic balloon pump is a little high and could be pulled back ~2 cm. An enteric catheter courses below the diaphragm, although the tip is incompletely imaged. There is complete left lower lobe collapse with an associated moderate left effusion. A small right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, though no overt interstitial edema. Enlargement of cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appears similar to prior examination. No pneumothorax is evident.
