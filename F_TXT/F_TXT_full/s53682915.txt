A single portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained. A new right internal jugular line terminates in the upper SVC/SVCbrachiocephalic junction. Indistinctness of the hilar vasculature has minimally increased since 8:50 am. A thin line at the right apex may represent a small pneumothorax. There is no consolidation or effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal.
