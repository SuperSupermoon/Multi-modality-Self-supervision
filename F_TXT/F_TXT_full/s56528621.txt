Following thoracentesis, there is no evidence of a substantial pneumothorax. Right pleural effusion has apparently resolved. Catheter overlying the right upper quadrant of the abdomen may potentially be in the lower pleural space, but a lateral chest radiograph would be helpful in this regard if warranted clinically. Again demonstrated is a large cavitary right upper lobe mass with associated mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy as well as distal post-obstructive changes. Hyperexpanded lungs are demonstrated with associated upper lobe predominant emphysema. Nonspecific opacities at the left base probably represent atelectasis.
