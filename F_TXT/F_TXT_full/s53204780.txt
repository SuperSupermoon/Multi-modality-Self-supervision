AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained two days earlier. On the present examination, the patient is aligned in frontal projection whereas on the preceding study was somewhat rotated towards the right. On previous report expressed concern for increased mediastinal widening can therefore be alleviated. Moderate cardiomegaly as before. Unchanged position of previously described dual-lumen dialysis line inserted via left internal jugular approach. Right-sided shunt line as before. An NG tube has been advanced and reaches well below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. There are no new pulmonary abnormalities, and specifically there is no evidence for left lower lobe pneumonia. The lateral pleural sinuses remain free.
