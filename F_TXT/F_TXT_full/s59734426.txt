The lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. However, there is a radiolucent region overlying the left hemidiaphragm which appears separated from the inferior aspect of the heart. This region is incompletely evaluated due to multiple external monitoring devices.
