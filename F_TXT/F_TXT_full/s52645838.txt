In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Opacification in the left mid zone again suggests atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. Opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small effusion. No definite pulmonary vascular congestion. The dilatation of the gas-filled stomach seen on the previous study is no longer apparent.
