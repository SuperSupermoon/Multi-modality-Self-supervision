Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Mild cardiomegaly persists. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Hilar contours are stable. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle is likely due to overlying soft tissue, though very trace effusion would be difficult to exclude.
