An endotracheal tube is in-situ. The carina is difficult to visualize and the precise level of the endotracheal tube is therefore not clear. This is at approximately the level of the sternoclavicular joints however. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid to distal SVC. There is a moderately large left pleural effusion, this appears to have increased compared to the prior study although this is likely due to the dependent layering of the fluid. This limits assessment of the left lung parenchyma. The right lung appears grossly clear although lung volumes remain low. No pneumothorax seen.
