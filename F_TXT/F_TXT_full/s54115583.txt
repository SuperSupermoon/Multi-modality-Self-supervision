The heart remains moderately enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is moderate pulmonary edema, similar compared to the prior exam, with a small to moderate left pleural effusion, also relatively unchanged. Probable small right pleural effusion is likely present. No pneumothorax is identified. Left basilar opacification likely reflects compressive atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or acute osseous abnormality.
