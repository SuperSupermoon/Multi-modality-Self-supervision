The patient is rotated to the right, somewhat limiting the evaluation. Lungs are low in volume but clear. Heart size is exaggerated by AP technique but likely normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are poorly evaluated but grossly unremarkable. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
