1. There is a small-to-moderate-sized right apical lateral pneumothorax which appears increased in size since ___, but when compared to a CT of ___, likely is not significantly changed and more likely is related to differences in patient positioning. However, followup imaging would be advised. There is also a moderate amount of pneumoperitoneum beneath both hemidiaphragms which was not previously appreciated on the plain radiograph, possibly due to differences in positioning and again this finding was present on the CT of ___. Clinical correlation would be advised. Lung volumes are low. Patchy opacities at both bases likely reflect atelectasis. A right subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip in the distal SVC. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.
