Compared to immediate prior exam, there has been little interval change except for interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube with the majority of the tube is coiled within the cervical esophagus and the tip terminating just proximal to the GE junction. There is otherwise stable positioning of a right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter. Positioning of endotracheal tube is difficult to ascertain with multiple loops of coiling of the Dobbhoff tube within the cervical esophagus. There is otherwise unchanged cardiomediastinal silhouette, bilateral layering pleural effusions and moderate pulmonary edema.
