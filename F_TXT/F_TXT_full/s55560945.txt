A chest tube has been advanced somewhat and projects over the right hemithorax appropriately. There is an abrupt turn at the side hole marker. This examination depicts a trace pleural effusion on the right, but a small pneumothorax is no longer apparent. A small quantity of subcutaneous emphysema is noted. The left lung remains clear. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.
