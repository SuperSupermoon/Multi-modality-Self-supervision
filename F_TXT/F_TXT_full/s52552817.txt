The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the upper parts of the right atrium, the line should be pulled back by approximately 2 cm to ensure of position in the mid to lower SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise the radiograph is unchanged.
