Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes. Previously seen right PICC is no longer identified. There is also removal of a previously seen nasogastric tube. There are likely bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, with overlying atelectasis, there is also perihilar vascular prominence, more so on the left than the right, raising concern for asymmetric pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess due to the bibasilar opacities. Mediastinal contours are slightly less prominent as compared to the prior study.
