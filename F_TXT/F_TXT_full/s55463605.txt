AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided. There is a dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine. There is a large retrocardiac opacity which could in part reflect the tortuous thoracic aorta, though a hiatal hernia cannot be excluded. The heart is mild to moderately enlarged. No effusion or pneumothorax. No signs of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Bony structures appear intact. A calcific density is seen in the right shoulder inferior to the glenohumeral joint, of unclear etiology.
