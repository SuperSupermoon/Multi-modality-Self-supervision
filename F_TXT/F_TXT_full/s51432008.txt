Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.4 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, coiled in the expected location of the stomach, portion not included on the image. A right-sided chest tube is seen projecting over the mediastinum. There is diffuse, extensive subcutaneous emphysema bilaterally throughout the thorax. Numerous rib fractures are seen, particularly on the right, which are displaced. It is difficult to exclude left-sided rib fractures. Known right-sided pneumothorax is difficult to identify. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is prominence of the right hilum, which could be due to underlying consolidation/contusion. However, underlying atelectasis from pneumothorax is not excluded. There are also subtle opacities projecting over the left lung base as well.
