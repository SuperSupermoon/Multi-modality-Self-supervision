When compared to prior, there has been slight interval improvement in the degree of pulmonary edema. Blunting of the lateral costophrenic angles suggests small bilateral effusions, likely decreased from prior. Streaky retrocardiac and right basilar opacities are likely atelectasis. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is similar compared to prior. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aorta. Right chest wall tunneled venous catheter is noted as well surgical clips of the upper mediastinum on the left. No acute osseous abnormalities.
