There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately 1.5 cm above the level of the carinal, recommend withdrawal by approximately a 1-2 cm for more optimal positioning. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. In the interval since the prior study, there has been significant in bilateral opacities worrisome for severe/pulmonary edema, underlying aspiration not excluded. No large pleural effusions are seen although trace pleural effusions are difficult to exclude. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
