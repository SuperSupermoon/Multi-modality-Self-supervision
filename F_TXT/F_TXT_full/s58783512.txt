Compared with ___ at 11:39 a.m. and allowing for technical differences, no definite change is identified. Again seen is patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region and at the left base (previous chest x-ray suggested in the left lower lobe). Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. No new focal opacity is detected. No pneumothorax is identified. Densities in the upper abdomen likely relate to prior embolization.
