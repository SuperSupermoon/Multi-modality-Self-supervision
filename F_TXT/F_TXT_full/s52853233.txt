Redemonstrated are chronic findings of bilateral parenchymal opacities, most notable within the right upper lobe and left mid lung, which are grossly unchanged from prior examination. The background lung parenchyma appears grossly clear without evidence of acute superimposed process. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Metallic densities again project over the left lung apex.
