There has been no change since the prior chest x-ray. The position of the tracheostomy tube and the hemodialysis catheter is unchanged. The position of the PICC line is less easy to determine but is probably slightly retracted since the prior chest x-ray and now lies at the junction of the SVC and left innominate vein. Costophrenic angles are clear. The lungs are clear.
