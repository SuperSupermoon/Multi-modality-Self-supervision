Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to a prior study obtained the same day earlier. The right chest tube is in place. There is a right apical pneumothorax demonstrated, small but slightly increased as compared to prior examination. The left chest tube is in place with no apparent left pneumothorax. The mediastinal and cardiac contours are unchanged including the aortic stent.
