Patient is rotated to the left. The patient's hand overlies the lateral left mid to lower hemithorax, partially obscuring the view and limiting evaluation. Given this, no large focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable grossly stable.
