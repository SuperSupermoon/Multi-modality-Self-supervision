The lung volumes are low. Faint bilateral nodules and peribronchial opacification are confirmed by images of the upper chest on the subsequent Cervical Spine CT. Bibasilar atelectasis is mild. There may adenopathy in the paratracheal mediastinal stations. The heart is not enlarged but exaggerated by low lung volumes and AP technique. There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature but no pulmonary edema. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
