As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line has been removed. Status post thoracoplasty with reduced lung size on the left and associated areas of pleural thickening. The right lung continues to show signs of minimal fluid overload. No larger pleural effusions. Mild atelectasis at the right lung bases. A 1-2 cm tubular structure projects over the right axillary region. The structure has the same diameter than the cables of the ECG leads that are also visualized. Nevertheless, the structure could represent the tip of the PICC line that was pulled back. Clinical correlation should be performed.
