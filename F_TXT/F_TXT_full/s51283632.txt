In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and hyperexpansion of the lungs. Bibasilar opacification could reflect small pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. Markedly dilated and tortuous thoracic aorta again was better seen on the prior chest CTA.
