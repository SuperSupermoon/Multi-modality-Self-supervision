Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular central line, and left-sided pacer are unchanged in position. There is a nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with tip not identified. The left internal jugular central line now has its tip either abutting the lateral wall of the superior vena cava or possibly heading slightly superior into the right subclavian vein. Repositioning may be helpful. The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG and mitral valve replacement with stably enlarged cardiac and mediastinal postoperative contours. There is persistent retrocardiac consolidation with an associated effusion likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. A right medial lung base patchy opacity is again seen which also may reflect atelectasis, although an infectious process cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema.
