Again seen are three chest tubes in the left lung. The appearance of the left lung is grossly unchanged, with extensive opacity, most pronounced in the mid and lower zones, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. No ptx detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured, but likely prominent and unchanged. There is mild diffuse prominence of markings in the right lung -- some of this appearance is likely accentuated by diffuse sclerotic metastasis projecting over the right lung. No right-sided effusion.
