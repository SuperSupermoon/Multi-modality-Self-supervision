Allowing for differences in technique and projection, there has been little change in the appearance of the chest since the recent study. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Lung volumes are increased. Chronic elevation of right hemidiaphragm is present. Apparent blunting of left costophrenic sulcus may be projectional, or could reflect a small pleural effusion.
