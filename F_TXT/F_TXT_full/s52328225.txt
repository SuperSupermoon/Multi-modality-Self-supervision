Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Tracheostomy tube is in a standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Left chest tube remains in unchanged position. Extensive subcutaneous gas in bilateral upper abdomen, chest, and neck is unchanged; this limits the evaluation of the lung parenchyma. Left upper lobe consolidations with cavitations are better seen in prior CT. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacities have increased. This could be due to increasing atelectasis or infection. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Pneumomediastinum is better seen in prior CT. Right PICC tip is in the upper SVC.
