Right-sided PICC terminates in the cavoatrial junction. The endotracheal tube is 1.5 cm above the carina. The enteric tube extends beyond the GE junction with tip out of view. The nasogastric tube extends beyond the image and loops back with tip terminating in the stomach. Lung volumes are low. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, unchanged compared to prior study. Bibasilar atelectasis is present. The small right pleural effusion persists. Increased hazy opacity overlying the left lung likely represents layering of the left pleural effusion posteriorly with the patient in the supine position. No pneumothorax.
