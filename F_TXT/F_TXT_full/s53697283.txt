In comparison with the study of ___, there is now a pigtail catheter in place at the right base with removal of some pleural fluid. There is continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour with some atelectatic changes above it. The upper lungs and left base are essentially clear. The suggested opacification in the left upper zone is again seen and of uncertain etiology. This would require CT for definitive evaluation.
