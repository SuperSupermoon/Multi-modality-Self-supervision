Enteric tube is seen in the mid stomach with the stylet pulled back 3.0 cm from the armored tip. The ET tube is in standard position. Right PICC terminates in the mid SVC, unchanged from prior. Left chest tube is at the apex. The heart size is accentuated by lordotic view, though unlikely enlarged compared to prior. The pulmonary vessels are mildly engorged without evidence of pulmonary edema. There are rounded opacities in the right lung partially overlying the anterior ribs, which may represent pneumonia or healing rib fractures. Left upper lung appears improved in aeration compared to prior. Again seen is small left apical pneumothorax smaller and extra pleural or loculated pleural hematoma in the left upper chest, unchanged from prior. No significant pleural effusion is seen. Multiple left rib fractures are unchanged.
