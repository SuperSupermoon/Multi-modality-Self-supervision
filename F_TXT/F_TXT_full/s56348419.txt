As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have improved, reflecting improved ventilation. This is particularly true at the lung bases, where parts of the pre-existing pleural effusions and areas of atelectasis have resolved. The left PICC line is now correctly positioned. Moderate cardiomegaly and mild fluid overload persists.
