Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates unchanged exam. As before there is mild hyperinflation with relative hyperlucency of the bilateral upper lungs and paucity of vessels suggesting underlying emphysema. Stable retrocardiac opacification likely represents atelectasis though cannot exclude infection in the correct clinical setting. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the aortic arch. Prominence of the right pulmonary artery suggests a degree of pulmonsry arterial hypertension. Heart size is not enlarged.
