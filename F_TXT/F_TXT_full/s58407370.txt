As compared to the previous radiograph, the cardiac silhouette continues to be substantially enlarged and signs of mild to moderate pulmonary edema still present. The atelectatic changes in the right lung have minimally decreased, reflecting improved ventilation. The probably atelectatic opacity at the left lung base is constant in appearance. No new parenchymal opacities. No larger pleural effusions.
