CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW Compared with ___ at 10:01 a.m. and allowing for technical differences, left-sided confluent opacities may be slightly improved. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is the tracheostomy, diffuse bilateral opacities, and enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette, with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
