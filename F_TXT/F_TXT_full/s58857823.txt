Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable. Bibasilar opacities have improved due to improving lung expansion and improved atelectasis. Small-to-moderate right and small left pleural effusions are grossly unchanged. Lines and tubes are in standard position. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has minimally improved. The opacities in the lower lobe that have improved could be due to atelectasis , but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
