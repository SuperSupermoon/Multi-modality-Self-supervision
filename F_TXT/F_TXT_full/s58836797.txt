AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: The patient is rotated to the right. Nevertheless, there is no appreciable cardiomegaly. Lungs are grossly clear, and pleural effusions are minimal, if any. Caliber of the mediastinum is difficult to assess, however, because of rotation. There could be distention of the azygos and other mediastinal veins. If that determination is important to make regarding the presence of pericardial effusion, then a repeat film should be obtained with careful attention to proper positioning.
