The tip of the nasogastric tube is not optimally seen and does not appear to extend below the GE junction. There may be a loop within the distal portion of the catheter with it being redundant within the distal esophagus. Would recommend repeat images for further evaluation. There is a left dual-lead pacemaker which is stable. Aortoiliac stent material is seen within the upper abdomen. Heart size is enlarged but stable. There is tortuosity of thoracic aorta. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or signs for overt pulmonary edema.
