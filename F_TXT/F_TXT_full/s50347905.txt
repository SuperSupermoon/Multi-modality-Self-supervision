Study is slightly limited due to patient rotation and low lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly is present, and the size of the heart is likely accentuated due to low lung volumes. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates calcifications of the aortic knob. While there is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, no overt pulmonary edema is seen. Minimal streaky bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Degenerative spurring in the left acromioclavicular joint is present. Assessment of the right lung apex is slightly limited due to the patient's neck soft tissues projecting over this region.
