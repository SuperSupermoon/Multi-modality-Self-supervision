1. Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 3.8 cm above carina. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm and the tip projects over the expected location of the stomach. The heart is upper limits of normal in size given portable technique. There has been interval reduction in lung volumes with suggestion of layering bilateral pleural effusions and patchy left basilar airspace disease which may reflect compressive atelectasis in this study with no evident effusion, although aspiration or early pneumonia cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity of detecting pneumothorax has diminished given supine technique.
