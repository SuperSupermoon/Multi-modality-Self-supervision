1. Interval removal of the left chest tube. There is a persistent small left apical pneumothorax. Continued close interval followup would be advised given the fact that the pneumothorax appeared after the chest tube had been placed on waterseal. Right internal jugular dual-lumen catheter is unchanged in position. Stable cardiac enlargement status post median sternotomy. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. Bibasilar opacities and associated layering effusions likely representing compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration could have this appearance. Interval improvement in the interstitial appearance suggestive of resolving pulmonary edema.
