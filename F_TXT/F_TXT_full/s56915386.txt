1. Bibasilar opacities, worse on the left than the right worrisome for pneumonia or possibly aspiration. Opacities are partly nodular in character so pulmonary nodules including the possibility of malignancy are not excluded. If findings are compatible with pneumonia clinically then short-term follow-up radiographs are recommended to show complete clearance; otherwise chest CT, preferably with contrast if possible, should be considered. 2. Findings suggestive of vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
