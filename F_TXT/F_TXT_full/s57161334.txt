Comparison is made with prior study performed 11 hours earlier. Aeration of the lower lobe has improved. Still there are bibasilar and left perihilar opacities. Right basilar opacities have almost resolved. There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Lines and tubes are in unchanged position.
