AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day at 6:17 a.m. Since prior study, there is interval increase in the cardiac silhouette, most likely consistent with interval development of cardiomegaly, although pleural effusion cannot be excluded. There is substantial progression of multifocal parenchymal opacities that might represent a combination of pulmonary edema and pulmonary infarct. Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
