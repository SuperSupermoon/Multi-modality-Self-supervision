Frontal radiograph of the chest is poorly positioned and much of the right lung is not visualized on this radiograph. A new enteric tube is seen along the expected course of the esophagus and then is not well visualized projecting over the mediastinum, however, it appears that the tube crosses the spine at the level of the T10 vertebra and projects to the right, several centimeters in the expected position of the stomach. Repeat radiographs are recommended to confirm this position.
