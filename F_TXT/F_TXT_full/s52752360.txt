Portable supine AP view of the chest provided. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 1.3 cm above the carina. Retraction by at least 1-2 cm would result in more optimal placement. The NG tube descends into the left upper quadrant. There is scattered subsegmental atelectasis, most confluent in the left lower lobe. The possibility of aspiration or pneumonia difficult to exclude in the left lower lobe. There is likely a small left effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
