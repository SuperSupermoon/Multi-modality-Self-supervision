The lungs are well inflated. Bibasilar linear atelectasis is noted. Retrocardiac opacity is likely related to gastric pull through, but previously seen superimposed pulmonary consolidation cannot be optimally evaluated for without a lateral view. Mild cardiomegaly and aortic tortuosity are unchanged. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable otherwise. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Again seen are three bone islands projecting over the anterior left second rib.
