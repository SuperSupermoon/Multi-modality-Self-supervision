Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates tracheostomy in standard position and intact median sternotomy wires. Multiple surgical clips in the right upper lung base compatible with history of right upper lobectomy for squamous cell carcinoma. Configuration of near complete opacification of the right lung with a large pleural effusion and elements of loculation in the right upper lobe and in subpulmonic location appears similar as compared to one day prior, with a small area of somewhat better aerated lung in the mid right hemithorax. The left lung is better aerated, with persistent left basilar atelectasis and small effusion. There is no discernable pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits allowing for semi-upright positioning and AP technique. There is evidence of posterior thoracotomy with disruption of posterior ribs.
