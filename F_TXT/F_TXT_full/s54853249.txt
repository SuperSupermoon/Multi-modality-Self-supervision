ET tube tip is 6.6 cm above the carinal. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Left subclavian line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal consolidations are overall unchanged. The only area that appears to be slightly worse is in the left lower lung where a layering pleural effusion versus developing consolidation is a possibility, attention to this area on the subsequent studies is required. There is no evidence of pneumothorax
