As compared to the previous radiograph, there was interval retraction of the endotracheal tube. Tip of the tube now projects about 6.5 cm above the carina. The tube should be advanced by approximately 2 cm. The orogastric tube is in the distal part of the stomach or the proximal duodenum. Unchanged course of the right internal jugular vein catheter. Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions. Overinflation of the stomach is no longer present.
