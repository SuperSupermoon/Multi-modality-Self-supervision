Minimal bibasilar opacities correspond with atelectasis seen on concurrent CT abdomen and pelvis. No confluent consolidation is identified. There is no large pleural effusion. No pulmonary vascular congestion or interstitial edema is evident. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal acontours are within normal limits and unchanged from prior. Mild prominence of the hila bilaterally is likely secondary to large underlying vasculature.
