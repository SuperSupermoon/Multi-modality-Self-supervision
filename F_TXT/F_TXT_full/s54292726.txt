As compared to the previous radiograph, the mediastinal diameter, in the light of the known aortic pathology, is constant. The pleural effusion and left atelectasis as well as minimal left apical cap is also unchanged. On the right, a previously seen small nodular opacity projecting over the middle rib is no longer visible. There is no right pleural effusion. No deviation of the mediastinum. No pneumothorax.
