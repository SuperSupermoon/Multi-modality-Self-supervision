Very small left apicolateral pneumothorax is identified, and is probably unchanged allowing for differences in technique between the two studies. Left chest tube remains in place. There remains partial left lower lobe atelectasis. Right lung is grossly clear, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance compared to the prior study. There is a persistent questionable small left pleural effusion.
