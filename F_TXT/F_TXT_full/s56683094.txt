As compared to the previous radiograph, the severity in extent of the pre-existing diffuse parenchymal opacities has slightly increased. Also increased is the diameter of the pulmonary vasculature. These progression suggests a combination of mild to moderate pulmonary edema, together with a diffuse parenchymal process, likely infectious or inflammatory in nature. Potential differential causes could be pneumocystis, pulmonary hemorrhage, or hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
