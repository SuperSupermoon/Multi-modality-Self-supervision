Again, a left internal jugular catheter terminates deep within the right atrium and could be pulled back approximately 6 cm to reposition in the low SVC. An endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina and is in appropriate position. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contour is stable. A previously seen right upper lobe opacity is smaller. Vascular congestion is improved. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumothorax.
