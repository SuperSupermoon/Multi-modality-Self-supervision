Single frontal views of the chest were obtained. The lungs remain hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are bibasilar opacities, likely due to atelectasis/scarring. Relative lucency of the upper lobes suggests underlying pulmonary emphysema. No definite focal consolidation is seen. The aorta remains somewhat tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. There are few chronic-appearing rib deformities along the posterior lateral lower left ribs.
