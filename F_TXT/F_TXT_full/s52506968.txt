The patient is status post sternotomy. The heart is normal in size. Patchy calcifications are noted along the aortic arch. There is also mild unfolding of the thoracic aorta. A mildly bulging contour along the lower left mediastinum suggests hiatal hernia. The right hemidiaphragm is moderately elevated. Streaky overlying opacities at each lung base suggest minor atelectasis. The upper mediastinum has mildly widened appearance, although this is probably within normal limits for the technique applied.
