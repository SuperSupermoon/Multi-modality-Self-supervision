In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes that accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Dense opacification at the left base with less prominent opacification on the right would suggest layering effusion volume loss in the lower lobe on the left, though a similar ground-glass appearance of the lower chest on an abdomen CT in ___ was concerning for an alveolar forearm of lung carcinoma. The pulmonary vessels are engorged and indistinct, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure that has increased since the previous study.
