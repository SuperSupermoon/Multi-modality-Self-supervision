Compared to the prior study, there has been interval placement of right-sided catheter with partial interval decrease in the size of the loculatedpneumothorax at the right lung base. The right hemidiaphragm remains somewhat depressed, but apparently much less so. A small component of the pneumothorax is again seen in the right paratracheal region, also decreased in size. A rind of increased density along the lower edge of the right lung is again noted, similar to the prior study-- question related to compressive atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is near midline, with only minimal residual right ward shift. Possible small amount of right pleural fluid. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged in size in contour. Linear lucency seen adjacent to the descending aorta is unchanged and likely represents artifact as there is no suggestion of pneumomediastinum in this area on the CT images from ___. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion are also grossly unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, but doubt overt CHF.
