AP chest compared to 4:01 a.m. on ___: Small bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right, unchanged since earlier in the day. Feeding tube with the wire stylet in place ends low in the stomach. Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC. Tracheostomy tube is oriented horizontally, probably because of drag on the ventilator tubing and should be evaluated clinically to see that its position is acceptable. Upper lungs clear. Heart size top normal. No change.
