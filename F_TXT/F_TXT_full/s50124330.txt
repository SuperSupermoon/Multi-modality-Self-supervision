Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 4.8 cm above the carina, and a right internal jugular vascular sheath terminates in the region of the right brachiocephalic vein near the junction of the superior vena cava. A small amount of soft tissue gas is present near the insertion site in the right side of the neck. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and apparent asymmetrical pulmonary edema pattern which is worse on the right than the left. On the right, there is also an apparent layering pleural effusion on the semi-upright examination. Improved left lower lobe atelectasis is demonstrated as well as a persistent small left pleural effusion. Linear atelectasis in left mid lung has slightly worsened.
