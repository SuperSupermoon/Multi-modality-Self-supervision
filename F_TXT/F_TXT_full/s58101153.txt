In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with the tip approximately 6.5 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube appears to extend well into the stomach, then coiled back on itself so that the tip lies in the region of the esophagogastric junction. The areas of increased opacification at the right base are less prominent on this study. Retrocardiac opacification persists.
