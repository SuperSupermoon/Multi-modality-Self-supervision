As compared to the prior radiograph from earlier today, a left pigtail pleural catheter is been placed. There remains near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax with only a small amount of residual aerated lung in the left suprahilar region. Known central mass in the left hemi thorax has been more fully evaluated by CT and is known to result in bronchial obstruction. Considering only minimal improvement in the degree of left hemi thorax opacification following pigtail pleural catheter placement, CT may be helpful to determine whether the tube is optimally placed and may also help determine the relative contributions to left hemi thorax opacification by post obstructive atelectasis and pleural fluid.
