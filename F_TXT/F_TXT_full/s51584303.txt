AP chest compared to ___: A new catheter is coiled over the right lower hemithorax, and is presumably responsible for decrease in right pleural effusion, previously largely fissural. Because of the nature of pleural fluid distribution, subsequent radiographs should be compared to frontal and lateral views whenever feasible. Small left pleural effusion and medial loculation of pleural air are unchanged, left pleural tube crosses the left base and ascends to the level of the left hilus, but cannot be localized more precisely on a single frontal view. Left subclavian infusion port ends in the right atrium. Heart size normal. There may be very mild pulmonary edema. I do not see clear consolidation.
