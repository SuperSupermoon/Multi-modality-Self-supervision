The distal end of the right-sided hemodialysis catheter is partially looped, unchanged from prior radiographs from ___ and ___. Tip of endotracheal tube ends 6.5 cm above the carina and is appropriate. Patient is status post medial sternotomy with intact sternal sutures. Orogastric tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach, however, the distal end is beyond the radiograph view. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, moderately enlarged heart, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Increased retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung atelectasis is new. Mild right infrahilar atelectasis has minimally worsened.
