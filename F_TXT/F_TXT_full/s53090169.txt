1. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. A right subclavian PICC line ends in the distal SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip coiled within the stomach. There continue to be bilateral layering effusions with bibasilar patchy opacities which may represent compressive atelectasis, although a bibasilar pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. There is a developing opacity in the right peripheral mid lung, which would be concerning for aspiration or early pneumonia. This can be better assessed on followup imaging. There has been interval improvement in the pulmonary edema with residual mild interstitial edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to marked patient rotation on the current examination. No definite pneumothorax is seen on the current examination. Marked degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints unchanged.
