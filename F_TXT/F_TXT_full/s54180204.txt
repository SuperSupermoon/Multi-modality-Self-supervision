New opacities raise the possibility of multifocal infectious infiltrates. Worsening CHF with interstitial edema and fluid in the minor fissure. Possible small bilateral effusions. Please see report of prior ___ chest x-ray which identified nodular opacities abutting the posterior inferior chest wall on the lateral view for which (nonurgent) CT scan with contrast was recommended. These are not directly visualized on this AP-only examination.
