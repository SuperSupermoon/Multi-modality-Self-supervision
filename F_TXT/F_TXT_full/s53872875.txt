As compared to the previous radiograph, there is marked improvement in ventilation of both the left and the right lung bases, particularly of the right base. However, the retrocardiac lung areas still show a relatively extensive atelectasis. Mild bilateral pleural effusions are now visualized. No new opacities. Mild cardiomegaly persists. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
