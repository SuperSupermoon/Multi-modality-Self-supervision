Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Bilateral asymmetrically distributed heterogeneous lung opacities appear relatively similar compared to the prior study, and continue to affect the right lung to a greater degree than the left. Left upper lobe is relatively spared by this otherwise diffuse process. Findings may represent a combination of asymmetrical pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
