In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, a right pleural catheter has apparently been removed. A new curvilinear interface is identified in the periphery of the right upper hemi thorax, in could reflect either a skin fold or a hydropneumothorax. Moderate to large, multiloculated right pleural effusion is similar to the prior study. Heterogeneous opacities in the right lung persist, with some improved aeration at the right lung base. No other relevant change.
