There appears to be interval improvement of the left large pleural effusion; however, this may be secondary to differences in positioning. Again seen is bibasilar atelectasis. There has been an interval increase in vascular congestion bilaterally. There is no pneumothorax. A right-sided PICC line appears to terminate in the mid SVC. The heart and mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.
