In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a right IJ catheter that extends to the mid portion of the SVC. Other monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Retrocardiac opacification is again consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the right base. There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, suggesting some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
