The endotracheal tube is in good position at 5.1 cm of the carina. However, the right subclavian line has been repositioned since the last exam. It is crossing the midline and its distal end is pointing downward on the left, which is unusual in a patient who does not have a left persistent superior vena cava. The exact location of the line cannot be assessed with this exam. It could be in any structure, and it does not follow the course of the normal venous system. The distal end of the TNG is not included in this exam, but probably in a good position. Amelioration of the bilateral opacities compatible with mild edema. Deterioration of retrocardiac opacity compatible with atelectasis. Slight deterioration of the mild pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
