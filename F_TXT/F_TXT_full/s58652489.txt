Monitoring and support devices are in standard position and unchanged from the prior examination. Again seen is a large retrocardiac opacity which obscures the left heart border and likely represents left lower lobe collapse and moderate left pleural effusion. Additionally, there is a new leftward mediastinal shift. The right lung is clear. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
