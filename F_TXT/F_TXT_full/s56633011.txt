Loss of volume and consolidation have increased at both lung bases, suggesting aspiration, leading to pneumonia and atelectasis. The upper lungs are clear. Borderline enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is attributable differences in radiographic technique and lower lung volumes rather than developing cardiomegaly. Mediastinal vasculature however is probably distended responsible for increased caliber of the supra cardiac mediastinum. Ascending thoracic aorta and aortic arch are heavily calcified but not clearly dilated. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely. No pneumothorax. Esophageal drainage tube ends in the upper stomach.
