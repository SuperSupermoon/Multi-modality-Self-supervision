In comparison with the study of ___, there is improved inspiration, but otherwise little change. Left pleural catheter remains in place with some residual retrocardiac opacification, but no evidence of post-procedure pneumothorax. Continued area of opacification in the right lung apex. If the condition of the patient would permit, a lateral view would be most helpful to better assess the previous loculated effusion.
