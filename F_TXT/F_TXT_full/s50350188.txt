Since the study of ___, there are substantially lower lung volumes with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. This is most likely related to the slightly increased transverse diameter of the heart and prominence of the aorta. A thick band of opacification runs vertically in the right upper zone, most likely related to atelectatic change. No definite vascular congestion or acute pneumonia.
