An accessed right pectoral MediPort terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. Mild prominence with increased density of the right hilus as compared to ___ may be due to mild pulmonary artery dilatation or lymphadenopathy. A faint nodular opacity projecting at the superior aspect of the left hilus may be a small nodule. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged. Background parenchymal changes consistent with emphysema are unchanged.
