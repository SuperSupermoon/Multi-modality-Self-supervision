Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is bibasilar atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. There is right paratracheal opacity without indentation of the adjacent trachea which may be due to prominent right-sided vascular structures and/or mediastinal fat; however, recommend further evaluation with a nonurgent chest CT or chest PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
