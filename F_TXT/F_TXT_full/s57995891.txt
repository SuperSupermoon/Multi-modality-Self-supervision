Single frontal view of the chest. Bilateral pleural pigtail drains and 3 leads of a left chest wall pacer are in stable position. Mild interstitial edema persists with a new elliptical opacity in the right mid lung region, possibly represent a new area of loculated fluid given its incomplete margins. Right effusion is otherwise unchanged. Left-sided pleural effusion has slightly enlarged with increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable
