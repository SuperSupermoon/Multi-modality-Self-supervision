In comparison with the study ___ ___, the chest tube is been placed on water seal. There is a small pneumothorax on the left with the distance from the superior aspect to the upper rib measuring about 2 cm. In retrospect, a similar curvilinear pleural line can't be seen in the previous study. The patient has taken a better inspiration and the opacification at the right base medially is less prominent. There is again pleural fluid with atelectatic changes at the left base.
