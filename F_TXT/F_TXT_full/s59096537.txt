Tip of endotracheal tube is about 7 cm above the carina and could be advanced slightly for standard positioning. Other indwelling devices remain in standard position. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Bilateral asymmetrically distributed alveolar opacities are again demonstrated, with interval improvement since the prior study, particularly in the left upper and both lower lobes. A confluent opacity in the right upper lobe shows only minimal improvement. Questionable small rounded lucencies are seen in the right mid lung region at the level of the eighth posterior rib. Attention to this area on followup radiograph would be helpful to exclude the possibility of necrotizing pneumonia in this region. Small right pleural effusion has not appreciably changed, but a left pleural effusion has apparently slightly decreased in size since the recent radiograph.
