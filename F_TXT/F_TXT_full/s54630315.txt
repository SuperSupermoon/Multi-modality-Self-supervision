Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina, Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the proximal descending left pulmonary artery, and an intra-aortic balloon pump tip terminates 9 mm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. This could be withdrawn slightly for standard positioning. Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach, and an esophageal probe is seen in the cervical esophagus lateral to the nasogastric tube. Heart is normal in size, and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and diffuse bilateral airspace disease with ___- and infrahilar predominance and relative sparing of the lung periphery. Observed findings are most suggestive of pulmonary edema and are accompanied by bilateral pleural effusions. No visible pneumothorax.
