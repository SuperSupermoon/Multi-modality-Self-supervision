Large scale opacification of the right lung has worsened, consistent with progressive pneumonia or aspiration or hemorrhage. Relative sparing of the left midlung is the reason I do not call this asymmetric pulmonary edema. New endotracheal tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach but would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are smaller. See the report of the subsequent chest radiographperformed at 15:33, dictated previously.
