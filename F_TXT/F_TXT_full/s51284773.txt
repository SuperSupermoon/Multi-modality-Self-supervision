There has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube, with distal radiopaque tip seen straddling the approximate location of the GE junction. This will require repositioning. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. There is persistent retrocardiac opacity as seen previously on prior examination, with overall grossly unchanged lungs. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or effusion.
