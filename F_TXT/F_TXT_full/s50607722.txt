In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing opacification in the right hemithorax consistent with worsening pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis involving the right lower lobe. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with some volume loss in the left lower lobe. Small effusion is seen on this side. Irregular opacification in the right paratracheal region is consistent with lymphadenopathy as seen on the prior CT. Central catheter remains in place.
