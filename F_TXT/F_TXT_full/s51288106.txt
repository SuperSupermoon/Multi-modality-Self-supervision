As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion has slightly increased. As a consequence, there is more right basilar atelectasis than on the previous image. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Unchanged small retrocardiac atelectasis. A nasogastric tube has been placed in the interval. The tube is coiled in the stomach. The tip projects over the fundus. No pneumothorax.
