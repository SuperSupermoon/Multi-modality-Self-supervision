AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___. Permanent pacer with single intracavitary electrode and right-sided Port-A-Cath system advanced via internal jugular approach are unchanged. No pneumothorax has developed. The previously described scattered patchy parenchymal infiltrates with most marked prominences in the right upper lobe, the central portion of the right lower lobe and scattered in the periphery in the left hemithorax remain rather unchanged. The interspersed nodular densities seen bilaterally again suggests strongly presence of secondary pulmonary metastases. The heart size is not significantly changed and it is doubtful that the observed pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates could be related to cardiac failure and pulmonary venous congestion. Evidence of small amount of pleural effusion on the left base appears unchanged and absence of right-sided pleural effusion is noted as before. The torso CT examination that was obtained during the recent two days' examination interval (___) is reviewed and the present findings on the portable chest examinations are compatible with the observed findings which appear stable presently for the short-term. No pneumothorax is identified.
