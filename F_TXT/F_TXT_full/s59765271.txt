AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Lung volumes are lower today than generally. Greater opacification in the left lung could be edema or pneumonia, and should be reevaluated at a deeper inspiration if that is possible. Right lung is grossly clear. There is no good evidence for pleural effusion. Heart size is indeterminate given severe anatomic distortion by marked scoliosis. Right jugular infusion port ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax.
