The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with the heart size appearing top normal. Focal contour abnormality at the level of the aortic arch corresponds to the known pseudoaneurysm which was better depicted on the previous CT. Calcified hilar lymph nodes are re- demonstrated. Architectural distortion with traction bronchiectasis and fibrotic changes are noted in both upper lobes, right greater than left, likely related to prior granulomatous infection. Patchy opacity in the right lower lobe peripherally was present on the prior CT, and again may reflect an area of infection. Patchy retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded, and there are small bilateral pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is detected.
