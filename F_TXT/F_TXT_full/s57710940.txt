The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 4 cm above the level of the carina. A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the low SVC. An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly. Bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right, is slightly increased. Lung volumes are low. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not significantly changed. Small pleural effusions are not excluded. There is no pneumothorax.
