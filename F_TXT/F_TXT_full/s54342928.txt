In comparison with the study of 217, the right PICC line has been repositioned so that the tip extends to the lower portion of the SVC. Other monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. There is increasing opacification at the left base with hazy appearance of the lower chest, consistent with volume loss in left lower lobe and layering effusion. Some displacement of the mediastinal structures towards the left. In view of the pulmonary changes, especially at the left base, it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia.
