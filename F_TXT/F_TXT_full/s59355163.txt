Endotracheal tube has its tip 2.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube and left internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. The heart remains stably enlarged. Lung volumes are low with worsening perihilar edema and persistent left lower lobe collapse. There are likely layering effusions. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
