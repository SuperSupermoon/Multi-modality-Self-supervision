Increasing opacification in the left lower hemi thorax is most likely increasing moderate left pleural effusion. On the right there is greater opacification at the lung base medially, difficult to distinguish between redistribution of moderate right pleural effusion for an increase in accompanying right lower lobe atelectasis. Pulmonary vascular congestion persist but there is no pulmonary edema. The heart is normal size. The apparent bulging mediastinal contour in the region of the ascending thoracic aorta could be right hilar adenopathy instead. ET tube and left PIC line are in standard placements respectively. No pneumothorax.
