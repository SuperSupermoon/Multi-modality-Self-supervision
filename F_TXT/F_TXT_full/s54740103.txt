There are bilateral interstitial opacities with a basilar predominance and pulmonary vascular engorgement. Near-complete opacification at the left lung base silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm and left heart border compatible with focal consolidation. A small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated but likely remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are prominent but stable with mild tortuosity of the aorta and calcification of the aortic knob.
