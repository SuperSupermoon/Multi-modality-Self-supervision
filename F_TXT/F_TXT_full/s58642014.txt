The endotracheal tube is in unchanged position. Unchanged evidence of a large left hilar mass, mild right mediastinal enlargement with stent in the brachiocephalic vein as well as abnormal right mediastinal contours. Minimal peribronchial opacities in both lower lobes, potentially reflecting a subtle infectious process. No larger pleural effusions. Unchanged atelectasis at the left lung base.
