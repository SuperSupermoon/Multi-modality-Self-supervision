As compared to the previous radiograph, the volumes of the lungs have substantially decreased. There is now mild pulmonary edema and areas of bilateral basal atelectasis. In addition, blunting of the left costophrenic sinus is visualized, potentially reflecting a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly.
