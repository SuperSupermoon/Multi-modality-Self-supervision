Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, as also seen previously, with blunting of the left costophrenic angle, similar in appearance to the prior study from ___. Mitral annulus calcification is seen. There is mild right base atelectasis. Subtle right base opacity most likely relates to atelectasis, although an early infectious process is not entirely excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
