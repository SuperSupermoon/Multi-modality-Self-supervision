Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size is top normal but it might be exaggerated by the portable and lordotic nature of this study. The mediastinum appears to be slightly widened again projectional and due to the manubrium of sternum projecting over the upper mediastinum. Lungs are essentially clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
