As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right internal jugular vein catheter. The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip of the catheter is difficult to visualize, given that it projects over the pacemaker leads. The tip appears to be located in the mid to lower SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The other monitoring and support devices are constant.
