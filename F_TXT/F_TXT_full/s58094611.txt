Endotracheal, enteric, and left basilar chest tubes remain in unchanged positions. Lung volumes remain low. Heart size is moderately enlarged but likely exaggerated due to low lung volumes. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour is unchanged. There is improved aeration of the left lung with continued opacity in the retrocardiac region likely reflective of residual atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is also likely present. Aeration of the right lung base also appears slightly improved with residual atelectasis. Known right-sided rib fractures are not well assessed on this exam.
