Endotracheal tube is in standard position at the thoracic inlet. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Very low lung volumes exaggerate mild enlargement of the heart and borderline interstitial edema. Left infrahilar consolidation could be acute aspiration, atelectasis or even pneumonia. No pleural abnormality is present.
