AP chest compared to ___, 5:28 p.m.: There has been substantial improvement generally in severe consolidation that previously involved all of both lungs, but most marked improvement has occurred in the right upper lung. Right lower lobe on the other hand has grown more consolidated. This suggests more than one concurrent condition, particularly possibility of right lower lobe pneumonia. Heart, never enlarged, is still normal sized, and mediastinal veins are attenuated, rather than dilated with fluid. One cannot make an argument for either volume overload or cardiac decompensation, and the interval improvement argues against ARDS. On the examination of 5:28 p.m. on ___, we might have been seeing residual edema from intraoperative fluid loading or reaction to intraoperative medication. Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles with the chin pointed down, no less than 7.5 cm from the carina, and it should be advanced 4 cm for more secured seating. Upper enteric drainage catheter is looped in the upper stomach. Right jugular line ends in the mid-to-low SVC and dual-channel left supraclavicular catheter also ends at the thoracic inlet. No pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged and I discussed the findings by telephone with the physician who responded.
