Single portable chest radiograph is provided. A pigtail catheter is present within the right mid pleural space. There has been reexpansion of the lung with essential resolution of the large pneumothorax with a small residual pneumothorax remaining. Opacity in the right mid-lung may represent atlectasis. The left lung is clear except for left lower lobe atelectasis. Median sternotomy wires are noted. The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. Right basilar opacity is likely atelectasis.
