Left-sided PICC terminates in the proximal SVC. An endotracheal tube terminates 3.9 cm above the carina. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is improved aeration in the upper and mid right lung status post recent bronchoscopy. There is persistent opacity at the base of the right lung and involving the mid right lung consistent with effusion and collapse. The left lung shows subtle opacities at the base, suggesting atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
