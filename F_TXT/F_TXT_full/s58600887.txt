AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. There is moderate cardiac enlargement. No typical configurational abnormality can be identified; however, a relative elevation of the cardiac apex is noted. A left-sided permanent pacer in axillary position is connected to two intravascular electrodes terminating in right atrial appendage and apical portion of right ventricle correspondingly. A mild prominence in the mid portion of the left cardiac contour suggests some enlargement of the left atrium. Most striking is the evidence of a rounded vascular density to the right of the trachea and most likely representing a right-sided aortic arch. The trachea deviates mildly towards the left supporting such diagnosis. The superior mediastinum, however, is moderately widened in addition and other vascular abnormalities cannot be excluded on this single chest view. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature does not give the impression of congestion. Our records include now also a chest examination dated ___ and transferred from an outside hospital. Findings are similar and support suspicion for a right-sided aortic arch abnormality. Further evaluation of possible vascular abnormalities by CT or MR is recommended.
