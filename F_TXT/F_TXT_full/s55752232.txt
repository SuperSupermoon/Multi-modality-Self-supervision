Single AP portable chest radiograph is compared to radiograph performed on the same date approximately 7 hours prior. A right breast prosthesis overlies the right lower lung somewhat limiting assessment. A small right pleural effusion is suspected. Opacity in the left lower lung is concerning for effusion and probable compressive atelectasis though difficult to exclude pneumonia. The heart remains enlarged. There is mitral annular calcification. No overt signs of edema. Chronic left rib deformities again noted as well as a right distal clavicle deformity. Dextroscoliosis of the T-spine again noted.
