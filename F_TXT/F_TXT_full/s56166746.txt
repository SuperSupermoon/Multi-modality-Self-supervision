Comparison is made to the prior study from ___. The heart size is somewhat globular with left ventricular prominence. There remains some subsegmental atelectasis at the lung bases without definite consolidation. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema. There is likely a small right-sided pleural effusion which has developed since the previous study. No pneumothoraces are seen.
