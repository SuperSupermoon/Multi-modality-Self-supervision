Since the prior exam, the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, and left chest tube have been removed. A right subclavian central venous catheter is in unchanged position with the tip in the right atrium. There is no pneumothorax. Retrocardiac volume loss has increased. Linear opacities at the bilateral bases are likely atelectasis. There is no pulmonary edema or definite pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with a postoperative appearance of the mediastinal and mild enlargement of the heart. Sternal wires and mediastinal clips are present.
