Comparison is made to prior study from ___. Due to the patient's body habitus the study is very limited. There are again seen airspace opacities, more confluent within the right lung. There is mild improved aeration in the left apex; however, this may be partially technical. There is a left retrocardiac opacity. Endotracheal tube and feeding tube are unchanged in position.
