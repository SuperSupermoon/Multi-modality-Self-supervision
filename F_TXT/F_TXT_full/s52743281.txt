Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is a new right pigtail catheter in the right hemithorax. Large known anterior air- fluid collection is not longer visualized, though would be better evaluated with a lateral radiograph to assess any residual air or fluid. Cardiac size is top normal. Small right perihilar and bilateral opacities largely on the right side are grossly unchanged consistent with infectious process. Patient has known emphysema. There are no other acute interval changes.
