There has been exchange of the feeding tube. The tip of the new feeding tube is within the fundus of the stomach and could be advanced a 5-10 cm for more optimal placement. There is an unchanged left-sided central venous line with the distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. There are slightly low lung volumes without focal consolidation or pulmonary edema. Heart size is within normal limits. There are no pneumothoraces.
