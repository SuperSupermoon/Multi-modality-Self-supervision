1. Nasogastric tube is again seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The heart remains stably enlarged. There is a stable retrocardiac consolidation likely with an associated effusion. In addition, there is more focal patchy opacity developing at the right lung base. Although these findings may represent atelectasis, aspiration and/or bibasilar pneumonia should also be considered. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
