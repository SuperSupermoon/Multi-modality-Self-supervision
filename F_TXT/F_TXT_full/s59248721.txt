A PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava. The patient is status post sternotomy. The heart is again moderately to severely enlarged. The pattern of multifocal opacities is very similar to slight worse to the prior study, allowing for small differences in technique, particularly in the left upper lung, and most suggestive of vascular congestion. Confluent basilar opacities probably reflect atelectasis and a moderate right-sided pleural effusion. No pleural effusion is identifiable on the left. There is no pneumothorax.
