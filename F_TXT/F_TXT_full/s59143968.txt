1. Left subclavian central line has its tip in the superior vena cava. Endotracheal tube has its tip below the thoracic inlet, unchanged. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm. Right chest tube remains in satisfactory position. 2. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema which somewhat limits evaluation of the lungs. The lungs remain markedly hyperinflated consistent with known underlying emphysema. When compared to previous studies dating back to ___, the more focal airspace opacity in the left upper to mid lung has progressed and therefore is concerning for an evolving pneumonia. There has been interval decrease in elliptical opacity in the right mid lung near the chest tube likely representing fluid loculated within the horizontal fissure. No pneumothorax can be appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.
