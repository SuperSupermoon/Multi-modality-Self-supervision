Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Increasing opacities in the right upper lobe and right middle lobe are consistent with worsening large areas of atelectasis. Increase in the amount of small pleural effusion is difficult to assess. Left perihilar atelectasis and left lower lobe atelectasis have also increased. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube is in the standard position. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mediastinum is unchanged. Pacemaker leads are in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
