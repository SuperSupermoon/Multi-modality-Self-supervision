Per the patient's nurse, the patient had pulled out his nasogastric tube prior to this chest radiograph being obtained. The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are areas of mild bilateral lower lobe atelectasis/scarring. Relative lucency of the upper lobes likely relates to emphysema. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The aorta is tortuous. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
