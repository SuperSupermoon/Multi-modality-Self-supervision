A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The patient has now been intubated with the endotracheal tube ending 3.4 cm above the carina. An upper enteric tube ends in the stomach. Moderate pulmonary edema and small right pleural effusion are unchanged from the prior study. No pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
