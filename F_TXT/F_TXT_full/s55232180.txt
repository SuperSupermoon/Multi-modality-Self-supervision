The patient is now intubated, the ETT appearing in the trachea and terminates approximately 8 cm above the level of the carina. This is unusual high position and is suggested to advance the tube further a few centimeters. No pneumothorax is present.

Previously described rib deformities on the right base appear unchanged and should represent old rib fractures. Referring physician ___ was paged at 4:35 p.m.
