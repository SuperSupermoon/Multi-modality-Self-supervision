No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size and there is indistinctness of engorged vessels consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. There may be mild atelectatic changes at the bases, especially on the left. The endotracheal tube noted in the clinical history is very difficult to identify on this single image.
