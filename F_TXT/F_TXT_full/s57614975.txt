Frontal view of the chest provided. Lung volumes are somewhat low, though there are diffuse ground-glass pulmonary airspace opacities with scattered more irregular consolidative opacities, most notable in the right lower lung. Overall appearance raises potential concern for pulmonary edema with superimposed pneumonia. Correlate clinically. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. No large effusion is seen. No pneumothorax. Bony structures are intact.
