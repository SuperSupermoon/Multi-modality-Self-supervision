There has been no detectable change since ___:41 following removal of the right apical chest tube. There is still a persistent pleural space in the right chest predominantly air-filled at the apex. Some loculated pleural or extrapleural fluid is also present, but the interfaces are partially obscured by skin folds, interfaces of the chest wall resection and subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall and axilla. Volume of right pleural fluid, probably small to moderate, collected at the base of the right chest is stable. Edema and atelectasis in the right lower lobe is unchanged. Mild edema in the left lung which has been an intermittent feature, is still present. Its appearance influenced by severe preexisting emphysema.
