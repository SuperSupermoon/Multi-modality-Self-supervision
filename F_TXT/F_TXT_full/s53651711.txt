AP chest compared to ___ at 4:54 p.m.: Increased pulmonary vascular congestion and new septal lines in the right lower lobe indicate new pulmonary edema, and suggested increasing opacification at the right lung base is dependent edema rather than aspiration or pneumonia, although either could be present. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax. Small pleural effusions are presumed.
