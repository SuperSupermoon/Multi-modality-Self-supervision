Comparison is made to previous study from ___. The tip of the endotracheal tube is 2.7 mm above the carina. This could be pulled back 1 to 2 cm for more optimal placement. The tip and side port of the orogastric tube are below the GE junction. There is a right-sided central venous catheter whose distal lead tip is in the proximal right atrium. The heart size is normal. There is mild improved aeration at the right base. The pulmonary edema has improved slightly since the prior study. There are no pneumothoraces seen.
