1. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Multiple bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal drains remain in place. There is a left internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip in the pulmonary outflow tract. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There is an endotracheal tube with the radiographic component projecting into the proximal part of the left main stem bronchus. Reportedly, according to a previous conversation with the patient's nurse, this is a double-lumen tube, although the second lumen is not radiographically visible. Therefore clinical correlation is advised. 2. A coiled radiopaque object is again seen projecting over the left mid lung and this could represent a retained surgical sponge, surgical packing or be external to the patient, representing some coiled wire. Clinical correlation once again is advised. 3. There is increasing mild pulmonary and interstitial edema. There is likely a layering left effusion. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. A left subclavian line is now visible and appears to terminate in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Retrocardiac opacity likely represents partial lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of pleural effusion in this postoperative patient.
