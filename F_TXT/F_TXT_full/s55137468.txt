Ill-defined opacity in the left upper-mid lung, demonstrating change in shape and size since yesterday, most likely represents a fluid collection in the chest wall, mostly related to recent chest tumor resection. This appearance does not really characterize as pleural fluid. Pleural effusion, if at all is small on the left side. Right perihilar consolidation, increased since yesterday is probably aspiration, related to recent bronchoscopy (history obtained by Dr. ___ during discussion over the phone). Right internal jugular sheath tip extends to the upper SVC. There are at least three chest tubes on the left side with one ending in the left lung base while other two extending all the way to the left upper lung. What appeared to be a mild to moderate effusion on yesterday's study is not appreciable today's.
