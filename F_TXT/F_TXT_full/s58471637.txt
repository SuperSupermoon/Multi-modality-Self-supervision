As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The right internal jugular vein catheter remains in situ. There is unchanged evidence of a relatively extensive right upper lobe opacity, likely reflecting hemorrhage after biopsy, and now also including several areas of consolidation. Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis and minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus. Unchanged evidence of mild cardiomegaly. No evidence of pneumothorax.
