1. Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen at least to just below the level of the diaphragm but the tip is not identified. A dual-lead left-sided pacer is again seen with the right atrial lead in appropriate position and the tip of the right ventricular lead not included on the image. Overall, there is slight improvement in aeration at both lung bases. There are persistent, right greater than left, pleural effusions with moderate pulmonary edema with associated bibasilar compressive atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax. Heart remains enlarged, likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. Overall stable mediastinal contours.
