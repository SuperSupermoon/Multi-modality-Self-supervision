As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. There is enlargement of the heart with enlargement of the bilateral hilar structures. Although this could in part be positional, short term followup should be performed to exclude centralized pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. The lung bases are better ventilated than on the previous image. The monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
