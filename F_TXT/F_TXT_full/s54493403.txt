AP chest compared to ___ 11:26 p.m.: Mild pulmonary edema may have improved. Difference in patient position probably explains the apparent change in mediastinal contours. Position of the left internal jugular line is explained by left-sided SVC, as explained to me in a conversation station about these findings with ___, the PA on clinical service. Mediastinal widening is unchanged, whether due to mediastinal venous engorgement, an abnormal aorta, or mediastinal bleeding, or fluid collection. Moderate bibasilar atelectasis is improved on the left, stable on the right. No pneumothorax. Small right pleural effusion is most evident superiorly. ET tube is in standard position. Nasogastric tube would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach.
