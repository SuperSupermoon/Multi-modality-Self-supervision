Compared to the prior film, the ET tube is been retracted and now lies approximately 2.9 cm above the carina. Again seen is an NG tube, with tip extending beneath diaphragm, off the film. Also again seen is a right IJ central line, with tip over distal SVC near SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax is detected. There is patchy opacity at the left lung base, consistent with atelectasis and/or consolidation. This may be very slightly improved compared 1 day earlier. Minimal atelectasis at the right base medially is also seen. There is probable minimal upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
