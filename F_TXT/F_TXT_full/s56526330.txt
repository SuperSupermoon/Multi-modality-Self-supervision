In comparison with the study of ___, allowing for differences in patient position, there is probably little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. The endotracheal tube is been pulled back so that the tip now lies approximately 3.4 cm above the carina. Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is unchanged, as is the left chest tube. No evidence of pneumothorax, though there is opacification silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.
