Single upright AP image of the chest. The lungs are well expanded. There is opacity at the left lung base which is supsicious for pneumonia. There is pleural thickening at the left lung base, which could represent loculated pleural effusion. There is also diffuse left-sided pleural thickening with overall volume loss, which maybe related to previous infection or hemothorax. There is no right pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged. Destruction and sclerosis of both glenohumeral joints is noted, suggestive of possible rheumatoid arthritis.
