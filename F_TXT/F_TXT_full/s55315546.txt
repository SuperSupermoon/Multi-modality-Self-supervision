AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs. Tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 15 mm from the carina. It could be withdrawn another 15 mm to avoid inadvertent unilateral intubation. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the proximal duodenum, traversing a non-distended stomach. An ascending pacer lead ends in the mid body of the right ventricle. Intra-aortic balloon pump tip is in standard position above the upper margin of the left main bronchus. Right jugular line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Heart is moderately enlarged. A bulge in the mediastinal contour could be an enlarged main pulmonary artery or alternatively aortic aneurysm. Atelectasis in the right middle lobe, probably explains the wedge-shaped opacity projecting laterally from the right hilus. Lung volumes are so low that it is difficult to say whether interstitial edema is present. There is no pneumothorax.
