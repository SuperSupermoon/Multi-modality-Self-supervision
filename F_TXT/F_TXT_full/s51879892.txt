Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and severe chronic cardiomegaly may be slightly smaller. Lung bases are poorly aerated, perhaps dependent edema and atelectasis, or consolidation or atelectasis. Discrimination between these possibilities would require chest CT scanning. No pneumothorax. ET tube in standard placement. Right transjugular temporary pacer lead tip projects over the right ventricular apex. Esophageal drainage tube ends in the upper portion of a nondistended stomach. Fractures are present in posterior of at least 4 left middle ribs. Additional fractures are presumed, but not readily detected by conventional chest radiographs.
