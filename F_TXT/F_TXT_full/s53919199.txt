The patient is markedly rotated to the right and the patient's mandible obscures the right apex. A tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. A left subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. Overall, lung volumes remain diminished and the opacity at the right base may have slightly improved suggestive of resolving atelectasis. No evolving airspace consolidation is appreciated, although due to patient positioning and inspiration, this study is somewhat limited. If the patient's symptoms worsen, followup imaging would be indicated. No obvious pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema.
