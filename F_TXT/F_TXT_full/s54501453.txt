No strong evidence of pneumonia is identified, though low lung volumes limit evaluation of the bases, particularly on the left. No pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax is present. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with tortuosity of the aorta and top normal heart size. A previously seen right-sided PICC has been removed. A left humeral prosthesis is partially imaged.
