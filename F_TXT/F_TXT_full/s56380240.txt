AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right PICC line tip is at the level of low SVC/cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Bibasal linear opacities are noted, most likely representing atelectasis with slight progression as compared to the prior study, thus infectious process in the lung bases is a possibility. There is no pneumothorax. No appreciable pleural effusion is seen. NG tube tip is most likely in the stomach.
