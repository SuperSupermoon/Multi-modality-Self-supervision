Compared with the prior study and allowing for technical differences, no definite change. Again seen is left-sided pacemaker with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle, sternotomy wires, and prosthetic tricuspid and mitral valves. Unusual configuration of wires over the superior mediastinum is unchanged compared with ___ in appears to reflect the presence of a sternal defect. Again seen is cardiomegaly and CHF, with vascular plethora and interstitial edema. There is bibasilar atelectasis, similar to prior. No gross effusion. As before, the pulmonary arteries are enlarged, suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. Incidental note is again made of deformity of the right humeral head, which may reflect an old fracture.
