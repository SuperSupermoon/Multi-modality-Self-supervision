The patient is status post median sternotomy and esophagectomy procedure. Endotracheal tube remains in place, with tip terminating about 2.5 cm above the carina. Other indwelling devices are unchanged in position. Widening of right mediastinal contours consistent with neoesophagus. As compared to the recent study, right basilar atelectasis and effusion have slightly improved, but there is no substantial change in the moderate left pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse. A curvilinear opacity in left upper hemithorax at level of the left fourth posterior rib is concerning for a small pneumothorax.
