The lung volumes are low. Mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. Bilateral basal parenchymal opacities, potentially associated to small bilateral pleural effusions. Rounded opacity with a diameter of 1.5 cm located in the right lung apex. Retrocardiac atelectasis. Although the bilateral basal opacities could represent both atelectasis or pneumonia, the right apical rounded opacity should be further worked up by CT, to exclude a neoplastic lesion. At the time of dictation and observation, the finding was post a to the radiology dashboard.
