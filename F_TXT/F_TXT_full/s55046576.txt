AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. The patient is markedly rotated towards the right, which accounts for asymmetric appearance of mediastinal structures on the frontal chest view. There is mild cardiac enlargement, and a mild degree of perivascular haze is seen in the pulmonary vasculature. This coincides with mild blunting of the right lateral pleural sinus with fluid advancing into the minor fissure. On the left base no pleural effusion; however, a plate supradiaphragmatic atelectasis is noted. No other acute pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates are present, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for comparison. Should patient be operated as scheduled, a followup chest examination is recommended to see further development of the described changes.
