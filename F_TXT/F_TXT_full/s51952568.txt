There is minimal leftward rotation. Endotracheal tube is seen with tip 4.6 cm above the carina. Left PICC line is seen with tip overlying the mid-SVC. NG tube is seen, with tip projecting below the lower limit of this film. Right-sided PA catheter is seen with tip overlying the right ventricular outflow tract. Also present is a right internal jugular central venous catheter with tip overlying the superior SVC. EKG leads are seen with corresponding wires projecting over the chest. Radiodense spring seen overlying the right mediastinum representing patient call button. No cardiomegaly. The bilateral hila are indistinct, with vessel engorgement bilaterally. Bilateral interstitial and ground-glass opacities, stable versus slight interval worsening as compared to prior film, representing moderate pulmonary edema. At least moderate bilateral pleural effusions; extent of change, if any, is unclear secondary to a change in positioning of the patient between the two films.
