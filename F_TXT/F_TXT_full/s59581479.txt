In comparison with the study of ___, there has been the development of areas of opacification in the left mid and lower zones as well as the right base with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. This is consistent with multifocal pneumonia and left pleural effusion. The right upper lobe pneumonia is essentially unchanged. There are some Kerley lines, suggesting some possible over-hydration.
