In comparison with study of ___, there is an endotracheal tube in place with its tip about 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. There is increased opacification in the retrocardiac region, which most likely represents some atelectatic changes. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is again suggestive of some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
