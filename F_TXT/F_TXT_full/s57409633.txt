A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava. There is no pneumothorax. Again noted also is a two-lead pacemaker/ ICD device. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. A hiatal hernia is much more prominent on this study and more visible along the right cardiophrenic sulcus. There is persistent opacification obscuring the left costophrenic angle. This may represent pneumonia but with no short-term change. A trace pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on the left side.
