Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There is an area of increased opacification at the right base, which likely represents a small pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. The left lung is clear. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. A right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction. A left-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the upper-to-mid SVC. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of field of view.
