In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube, which extends to the mid to lower body of the stomach be for turning toward the left, presumably at the greater curvature. Endotracheal tube and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged. Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. The large left basilar opacification is again seen, consistent with biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma.
