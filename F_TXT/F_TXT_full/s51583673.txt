The lung volumes are low. In comparison to the prior exam on ___, there is a decrease in the amount of interstitial markings, suggesting improvement in the previously seen mild pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The previously seen small retrocardiac opacity is stable and most consistent with atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and unchanged from the prior exam. The aorta is tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications. Sternal wires are intact and clips are noted in the mediastinum. Degenerative changes are noted in the bilateral shoulders, worse on the right than the left, with a stable right shoulder dislocation.
