In comparison with the study of ___, there are extremely low lung volumes with striking elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour related to a large hiatal hernia.

If the condition of the patient permits, a lateral view could be helpful to evaluate the retrocardiac area as well as the area behind the hiatal hernia.
