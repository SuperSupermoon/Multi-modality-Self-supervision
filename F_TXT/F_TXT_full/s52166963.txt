History of recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Markedly rotated positioning. Allowing for this, the tip of the ET tube appears to lie approximately 2.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. A right IJ central line tip overlies the mid/lower SVC. There is background COPD and parenchymal scarring. There is cardiomegaly with enlarged pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary hypertension. There is a small left effusion, and ? pleural calcification at the right base. There is probably underlying pneumonic opacity in the mid and lower zones and to a lesser extent in the right upper zone paratracheal region. Again seen is a small left effusion with underlying left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Possibility of some superimposed fluid overload cannot be excluded. Compared with ___, the mid and lower zone opacities appear slightly improved; the right paratracheal opacity is worse but may be accentuated by rotated positioning.
