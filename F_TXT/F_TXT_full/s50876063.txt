Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates well expanded lungs. 5 and 4 mm calcified granulomas in the left upper lobe are stable. 4 mm right pleural calcified lesion is most consistent with calcified granuloma. Lungs are otherwise clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are unremarkable. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.
