The left-sided PICC line projects over the left axilla, likely in the left axillary vein. Mild cardiomegaly is stable compared to exams dating back to at least ___. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Mild bibasilar atelectasis is persistent, however opacities overlying the perihilar and mid to lower lung field bilaterally has increased and is likely secondary to worsening moderate pulmonary edema. Calcification is again noted of the aortic knob and descending thoracic aorta, otherwise the hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
