Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. There is increased opacification of the right base which likely represents pneumonia. The left lung is essentially clear. There is a probable small right-sided pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The tracheostomy tube ends 2 cm from the carina. Right-sided PICC ends in the distal SVC.
