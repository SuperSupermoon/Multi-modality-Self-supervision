Tracheostomy tube again noted. Again seen is a right-sided PICC line, with tip near cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax detected. Allowing for technical differences, the overall appearances are quite similar. However, there is improved aeration at the left base, with new visualization of left hemidiaphragm, and less pronounced density at the right lung base. Small bilateral effusions and underlying bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation remains present. Extensive vascular engorgement is again seen the and confluent opacity in left mid greater than right stones is again noted.
