Assessment of fine detail in the lower lungs and chest is considerably limited by overlying soft tissues. Allowing for this, there is increased density over the lower half of both lung bases, though this could represent artifact due to overlying soft tissues, the possibility of parenchymal opacity cannot be excluded. There is faint suggestion of bibasilar air bronchograms. There is upper zone redistribution. The possibility of more extensive CHF or of small effusions would be difficult to exclude on this view. The base of the left lung is not well evaluated on this study.
