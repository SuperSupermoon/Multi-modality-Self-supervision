There is a left IJ central venous line and a right subclavian central venous line which are unchanged in position. There is also a left-sided chest tube whose distal tip is at the lung apex. There is also a second chest tube on the left with the distal tip at the lung base. Since the previous study, there has been slight decrease in left-sided pleural effusion with some loculated fluid at the left mid lung field. The right lung is grossly clear. No pneumothoraces are identified.
