New tracheostomy tube, the tip is approximately 5 cm above the carina. New chest tubes in the right hemithorax. Slightly increased right pleural fluid amount. Minimal linear structure to right apex, potentially reflecting a small right pneumothorax. Increase in extent of the pre-existing right basal opacity, likely post-surgical atelectasis. Unchanged are the other monitoring and support devices.
