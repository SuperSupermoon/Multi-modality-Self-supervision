Single, AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The costophrenic angles are not completely included on the image. Given this, relative lucency of the upper lobes as compared to the lung bases may be due to pulmonary emphysema. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No pulmonary edema is seen. No displaced fracture is seen.
