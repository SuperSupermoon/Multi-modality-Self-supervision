There has been interval placement of a nasoenteric catheter with the tip in the proximal stomach. A right approach central venous line is in unchanged standard position. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect a combination of atelectasis and small pleural effusions. Upper lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged and slightly exaggerated due to the AP technique of the film. A left humeral head prosthesis is partially imaged.
