Compared to the prior study, there appears to been interval improvement in the previously seen subsegmental atelectasis of the right upper lobe. Density in the right peritracheal position on the current exam is thought to represent vascular structures, within the range of normal for technique. The right minor fissure is restored to normal position and thickness. There may be minimal linear atelectasis at the left base, but no consolidation or effusion is detected. There is mild upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. No effusion. The NG tube tip overlies the stomach. The side port may lie immediately distal to the GE junction.
