AP chest compared to ___ and earlier on ___: Huge cardiac silhouette is expanded predominantly to the right by an unusual intrapericardial collection which on CT scan severely compromises the volumes of the right atrium and ventricle. Lungs are well expanded and clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. I discussed the findings with a member of the care team at 9:45 a.m. when the findings were recognized.
