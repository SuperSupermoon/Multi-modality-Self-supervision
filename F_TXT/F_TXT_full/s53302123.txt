Portable semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates decreased lung volumes, with interval increase in bibasilar opacities particulary on the right likely reflecting a combination of pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated, and the mediastinal contours again show calcification of the aortic knob and aortic tortuosity. Healed left rib fractures are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
