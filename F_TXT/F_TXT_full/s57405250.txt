Single frontal radiograph demonstrates stable position of a left pectoral cardiac pacer/AICD with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. The device partially obscures a portion of the left mid lung. Median sternotomy wires appear intact. There is evidence of prior coronary arterial bypass surgery. The heart is normal in size. The thoracic aorta is moderately tortuous. There is atherosclerotic calcification in the aortic arch. The lungs are clear, despite low volumes. There is no pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion.
