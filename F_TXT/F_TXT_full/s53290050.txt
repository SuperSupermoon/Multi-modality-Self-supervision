Endotracheal tube tip terminates 3.8 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing within the esophagus and off the inferior borders of the film. The heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Lung volumes are low which cause crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No overt pulmonary edema is seen, though there is mild cephalization of the pulmonary vascular markings. Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. Assessment for a left-sided pneumothorax or pleural effusion is limited as the left lung base is excluded from the field of view. No large right pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
