In comparison with study of ___, there are lower lung volumes with evidence of esophagectomy and gastric pull-through. Nasogastric tube tip is at the level of the carina. There is some indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels. It is unclear whether this represents elevated pulmonary venous pressure or is merely a manifestation of low lung volumes. Right chest tube is in place without pneumothorax. Subcutaneous gas is seen along the chest wall on the lower and the upper abdomen. Bibasilar atelectatic changes are noted.
