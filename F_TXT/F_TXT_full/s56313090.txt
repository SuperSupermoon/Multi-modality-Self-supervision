Since a recent chest radiograph of 1 day earlier, a left retrocardiac opacity has slightly worsened, and probably represents atelectasis. Followup PA and lateral radiographs may be helpful for more complete characterization. Apparent elevation of left hemidiaphragm is similar to the prior study with adjacent small left pleural effusion.
