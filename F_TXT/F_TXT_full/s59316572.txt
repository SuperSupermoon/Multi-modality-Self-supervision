In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been removed. The right IJ catheter extends to the mid to lower portion of the SVC. Relatively low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Tortuosity of the aorta is seen. There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could reflect mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Blunting of the costophrenic angles persists. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
