There has been significant interval improvement in the layering right-sided pleural effusion which has now nearly completely resolved. There is residual a atelectasis in the right lung base, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. A small left pleural effusion persists. The degree of atelectasis has improved slightly at the left base. A left-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax seen. A tracheostomy is unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study.
