Portable semi-upright chest radiograph is obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of view. The lungs are low in volume, giving the appearance of bronchovascular crowding with left basilar opacity which could reflect atelectasis. A small effusion may also be present. There is no pneumothorax. The heart is top normal in size.
