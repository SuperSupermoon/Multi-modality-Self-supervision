In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip about 3.5 cm above the carina. Left IJ catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC. Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the side port is above the esophagogastric junction. Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
