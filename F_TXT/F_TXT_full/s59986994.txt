Overall appearance of the chest is relatively similar to the recent study except for worsening left retrocardiac opacity which probably represents a combination of small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent left lower lobe atelectasis and/or consolidation; additionally, patchy and linear opacities at the right lung base have also slightly worsened. Remainder of lungs are clear, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
