Single portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube which appears to terminate 3.8 cm above the level of the carina in appropriate position. Heart size is within normal limits. Hilar contours are unremarkable. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Reticular opacities are noted at bilateral lung bases and right apex. This may reflect an interstitial process. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Visualized osseous structures demonstrates no acute abnormality.
