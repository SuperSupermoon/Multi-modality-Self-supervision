Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The tracheostomy is in place with the ET tube being 4.6 cm above the carina. Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged with substantial mediastinal widening, similar to the prior study. Vascular engorgement is redemonstrated and might correlate to chronic status of the patient, in particular if the patient has known congestive heart failure or renal disease. Overall, minimal change since prior examination is demonstrated.
