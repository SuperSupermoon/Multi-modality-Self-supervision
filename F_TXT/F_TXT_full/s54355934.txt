The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The heart size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse in the interval, though the lung volumes are lower compared to the previous exam. Persistent triangular area of opacification within the lateral aspect of the right mid lung field as well as bibasilar airspace opacities are demonstrated. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, not changed from the previous exam. No pneumothorax is identified although assessment of the lung apices is obscured by the patient's chin and soft tissues of the neck projecting over this region. A pigtail catheter is demonstrated which terminates in the region of the right lung base, unchanged.
