In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has taken a better inspiration. The tip of the endotracheal tube measures approximately 2.7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube remains within the fundus of the stomach. Streak of atelectasis is seen at the right base. There may be mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Some respiratory motion partially obscures the image, making it difficult to unequivocally exclude a small area of consolidation.
