AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 10:36 a.m.: Pulmonary vascular congestion, more readily appreciated in the right lung has worsened consistent with heart failure and/or volume overload. More extensive consolidation and accompanying moderate left pleural effusion worsened since ___, strongly suggestive of pneumonia. Pleural tube in place. No pneumothorax. Right central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC. Upper enteric feeding tube ends in the stomach, would need to be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction. A segmented crescentic metal device projecting over the left upper abdominal quadrant is unfamiliar to me. It was not present on earlier examinations.
