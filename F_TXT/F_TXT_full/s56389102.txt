AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar portable chest examinations obtained 8 and 12 hours earlier correspondingly during the same day. The previously identified temporary pacer wire has been removed. The heart size remains unchanged. The initial congestive pulmonary vascular pattern appears now normalized. A hazy density over the right lung base may be caused by pleural effusion layering in the posterior compartments, but this finding is not conclusive on this single AP chest view examination. No pneumothorax can be identified in the apical area. No new infiltrates are seen.
