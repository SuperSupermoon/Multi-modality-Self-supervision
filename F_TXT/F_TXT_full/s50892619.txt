AP chest compared to ___: Tip of the endotracheal tube, no less than 25 mm above the carina is in standard position since the neck is flexed. Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened, and there is now new small left pleural effusion, and increasing moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion. External devices overlying the right chest make it difficult to exclude pneumothorax. Air in the region of the right hemidiaphragm on preceding radiographs was attributed to pneumoperitoneum. I would recommend an upright view of the chest after removal of external material. Dr. ___ was paged, at 9:15 a.m. when the findings were recognized.
