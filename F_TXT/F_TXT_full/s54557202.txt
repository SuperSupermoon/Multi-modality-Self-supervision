AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: There is pneumopericardium and pneumomediastinum. The latter could obscure medial pneumothorax, or mimic it. An upright radiograph is recommended if feasible to see if there is actually air in the pleural space. A wedge of radiopacity in the right lower lung is probably atelectasis, but I am not sure whether it is middle or lower lobe. There is no pneumothorax on the right. ET tube tip at the thoracic inlet is no less than 5.5 cm from the carina, with the chin elevated, acceptable position. Nasogastric tube ends in the mid stomach. Heart size is exaggerated by low lung volumes. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no edema or appreciable pleural effusion.
