A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. The endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina. An enteric catheter loops in the fundus of the stomach. Cardiomegaly is severe. Additional widening of the upper mediastinum is attributable to fat. Small pleural effusions and subsegmental atelectasis are better seen on the subsequently acquired CT. The aortic arch is extensively calcified. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal vascular clips are in expected positions.
