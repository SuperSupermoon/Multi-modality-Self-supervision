Right basilar pigtail catheter is new in the interval. Moderate size partially loculated right empyema appears decreased in size compared to the previous radiograph with increased air noted in the pleural space. There is minimally improved aeration in the right lung base compared to the previous radiograph with continued atelectasis noted. Rightward shift of mediastinal structures is re- demonstrated. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are otherwise unchanged with the heart size within normal limits. The left lung is grossly clear. No left-sided pneumothorax is identified.
