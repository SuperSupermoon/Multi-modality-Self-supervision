The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased. Multifocal airspace opacities are seen throughout the right lung, predominantly in the right lung base as well as the left lung base compatible with multifocal pneumonia. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated due to low lung volumes but is likely within normal limits. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits with tortuosity of the aorta. The patient is status post median sternotomy with discontinuity of the two superior most wires.
