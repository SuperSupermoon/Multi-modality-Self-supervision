Right chest tube remains in place with its tip at the apex. There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with patchy opacity at the right base which either reflects loculated pleural fluid within the horizontal fissure or could represent an evolving pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. The left lung remains grossly clear. No pneumothorax is seen. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
