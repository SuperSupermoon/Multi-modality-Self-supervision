The heart remains markedly enlarged. There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. Mediastinal contours are stable. There has been interval appearance of mild to moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema. Increasing retrocardiac consolidation may reflect a component of compressive lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion or merely be related to the edema. Linear opacity in the left mid lung likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
