Compared with ___, there is new pronounced opacity in the right lung. This appears to represent a combination of both pleural and parenchymal opacities extending throughout much of the right lung. A right chest tube is seen at the base of the right lung. An additional tube lies in the region of the right lung base or upper abdomen. No definite pneumothorax, though the possibility of some loculated pleural air at the lung base cannot be entirely excluded. Again seen is cardiomegaly. The mediastinum remains midline. On the left, there is some patchy basilar and retrocardiac opacity. No left effusion. No evidence of CHF.
