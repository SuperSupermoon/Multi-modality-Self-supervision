AP chest compared to ___:08 p.m.: Relatively small residual left pleural effusion and/or pleural thickening, no change in basal pigtail pleural drain, tip against the mediastinum. No pneumothorax. Mild edema in the left lung has worsened, probably a function of reexpansion and general mild edema. In the right lung consolidation in the upper lobe anterior segment is less pronounced, but there is more peribronchial opacification at the lung base. These findings and the sequence suggest aspiration, but radiographically mild pulmonary edema is probably contributing to the radiodensity. No pneumothorax. Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 8:20 a.m., 60 seconds after they were recognized.
