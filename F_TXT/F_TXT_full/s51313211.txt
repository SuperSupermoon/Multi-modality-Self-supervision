1 portable AP upright view of the chest. There is marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. There has been an interval increase in pulmonary vascular engorgement and pulmonary edema. No definite pleural effusion however there may be a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. More confluent opacity in the right lung base likely represents engorged pulmonary vasculature/edema however pneumonia cannot be completely ruled out.
