Endotracheal tube is located at the origin of the right mainstem bronchus. The tube could safely be withdrawn 2-3 cm. An enteric tube courses into the first portion of the duodenum. A VP shunt is partially imaged. Lung volumes are low. There are bilateral parenchymal opacities compatible with mild pulmonary edema. The heart is mildly enlarged. There is a more focal opacity in the left lower lung, which may reflect infection or asymmetric pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. There is likely a small left pleural effusion.
