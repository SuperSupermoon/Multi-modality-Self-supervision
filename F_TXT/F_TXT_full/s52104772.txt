As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased, there is unchanged evidence of centralized bilateral parenchymal opacities, combined to basal areas of atelectasis. Overall, the severity of the opacities has not increased. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No pneumothorax. No larger pleural effusions.
