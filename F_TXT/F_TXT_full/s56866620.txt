A portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates normal cardiac size and a tortuous thoracic aorta, with clips along the left mediastinum. The lungs are hyperinflated with chronic appearing changes particularly in the right. There is no pneumothorax. Blunting of the lateral costophrenic angles suggests small pleural effusions, left greater than right.
