There are increased bilateral pleural effusions. The vasculature is ill-defined and there is diffuse alveolar opacities, lower lobe greater than upper lobe. It is unclear how much of this is fluid overload or if there is an associated infectious infiltrate in the lower lobes. A feeding tube is seen with the tip in the duodenum. Compared to the prior study, the pulmonary status appears much worse.
