Post-traumatic findings along the left posterolateral chest wall including pleural thickening appear unchanged. Again there is also a mild to moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with a pleural effusion that is probably small to moderate in size on the right and possibly with a small pleural effusion on the left. Streaky left basilar opacity suggests atelectasis. Perihilar fullness and hazy prominent pulmonary vasculature suggest mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.
