In comparison with the study of ___, there is asymmetry at the bases with increased opacification on the left. Although this could represent atelectasis above and elevated left hemidiaphragm, in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia should be considered. A lateral view would be helpful for further evaluation. There is also an area of increased opacification in the perihilar region on the left. This could reflect some central engorgement of pulmonary vessels and possible asymmetric edema, although this finding is more commonly seen on the right. Cardiac silhouette is more prominent than on the previous study, though much of this could reflect the AP portable rather than PA upright position of the patient. The right lung is essentially clear.
