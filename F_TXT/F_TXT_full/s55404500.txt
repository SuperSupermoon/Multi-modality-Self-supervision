Diffuse interstitial markings are noted, right greater than left. Additionally, there is a right upper lobe opacity with mediastinal shift towards the right. This is suggestive of underlying volume loss, possibly prior lobectomy changes. However, if there is no history of surgery, underlying malignancy should be considered. Superimposed post-obstructive pneumonia is possible. Atelectasis is noted at the left lung base. No substantial pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
