The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube has been passed into the stomach, although its tip lies below the inferior margin of the acquired film. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear probably unchanged allowing for differences in technique including cardiomegaly. Widespread opacification suggests pulmonary edema. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured and this may be due to coinciding atelectasis but possibly pneumonia. There may also be developing focal opacity at the right lung base. There is no pneumothorax.
