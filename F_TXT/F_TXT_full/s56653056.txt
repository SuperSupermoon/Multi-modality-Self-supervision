Single portable view of the chest. Left PICC is again seen. On the current exam, the tip is not definitively identified, but is thought to be in the region of the cavoatrial junction. Appearance of the lungs has not changed. Persistent right basilar opacity is seen with blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle with linear adjacent opacities, suggesting effusion and underlying atelectasis, noting infection cannot be excluded, similar to prior. The left lung is grossly clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Multiple median sternotomy wires are again seen.
