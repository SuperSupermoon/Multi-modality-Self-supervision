There is no appreciable left pleural effusion and atelectasis is restricted to the base of the postoperative left lung. Right lung is clear. Bulge in the mediastinum in the region of the ascending aorta is unexplained. I had repeated chest radiograph later this afternoon to make sure that there is no mediastinal fluid accumulation. Moderate-to-severe gaseous distention of the stomach, with air and fluid, present with no visible nasogastric tube. Subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall is relatively stable. Dr. ___ was paged at 11:20 a.m. as soon as the findings were recognized.
