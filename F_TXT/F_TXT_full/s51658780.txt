In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes with diffuse pulmonary opacifications throughout both lungs. Much of this is due to pulmonary edema, presumably related to volume overload. More coalescent opacification is seen in the right upper zone, bounded inferiorly by the minor fissure. This could probably reflect a combination of pneumonia and volume loss in the right upper lobe.
