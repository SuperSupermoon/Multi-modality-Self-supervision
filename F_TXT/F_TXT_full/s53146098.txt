Some clearing in the left upper lobe component of the still severe, extensive, bilateral pulmonary consolidation. Apparent decrease in opacification in the right upper lobe component might be due to cavitation instead of clearing. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions persist. Heart size normal. Right PIC line ends in the region of thesuperior cavoatrial junction. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. No pneumothorax. Vascular stent in the right neck has not migrated.
