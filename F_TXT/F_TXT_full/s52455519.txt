A portable frontal chest radiograph both again demonstrates a right PICC terminating in the mid to low SVC, endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, and enteric tube extending below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image, unchanged in position. An esophageal probe terminates above the thoracic inlet. Heart size is normal and the lungs are well-aerated and clear. The aortic contour is prominent, unchanged and at least tortuous. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is present. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
