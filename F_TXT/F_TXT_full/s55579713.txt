Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There has been placement of a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip at the distal SVC. There are no pneumothoraces. A stent is seen in the mediastinum and axilla likely within the left brachiocephalic and brachial veins. There is again seen volume loss on the left with a left retrocardiac opacity and left-sided pleural effusion. No pneumothoraces are seen.
