Lung volumes remain low. The heart size is unchanged, and within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar compared to the prior exam. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Linear opacities within the left lung base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. More patchy opacities in the lung bases also likely reflect atelectasis due to low lung volumes. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
