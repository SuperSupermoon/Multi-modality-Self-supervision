The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged allowing for differences in technique. There is predominantly perihilar opacification that is striking and new since the prior studies, suggesting pulmonary edema. There is also increasing right basilar opacification, which may reflect a coinciding pleural effusion, but is not well characterized versus elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, which could also be considered. The area is not completely imaged. There is no pneumothorax.
