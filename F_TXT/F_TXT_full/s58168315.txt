Tip of the endotracheal tube is 4.4 cm above the carina and is appropriately positioned. An orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, its distal end is off the radiographic review. Tip of right internal jugular line lies at mid SVC. Over the last 24 hours right upper lobe consolidation has improved, whereas right lower lung and left apical consolidation is overall unchanged. Increased retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung atelectasis and/or consolidation is similar. Small right-sided pleural effusion is stable. Heart size is top normal and unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
