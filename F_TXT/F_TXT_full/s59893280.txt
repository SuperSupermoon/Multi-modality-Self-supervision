In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an orogastric tube that extends into the upper stomach. The side hole is just distal to the esophagogastric junction. Other monitoring and support devices remain in place. Little change in the bilateral parenchymal opacification, partly due to atelectasis and partly to pulmonary edema.
