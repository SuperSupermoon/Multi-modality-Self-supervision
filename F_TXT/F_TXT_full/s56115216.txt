Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette quite enlarged. Other may be mild vascular congestion. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. No focal consolidation. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle is felt to more likely due to atelectasis and a trace pleural effusion. Partially imaged aortic stent graft noted but not well evaluated on this study.
