There has been interval placement of a pigtail chest tube catheter within the right lateral lower hemithorax. Previously seen right pneumothorax has decreased in size with a small residual right apical pneumothorax noted. There has been re-expansion of the right lung. Subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the right lateral chest wall along the course of the catheter. Lung volumes are low. The heart size is normal with a left ventricular configuration. The aorta is mildly tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no contralateral shift of the mediastinum. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion may be present.
