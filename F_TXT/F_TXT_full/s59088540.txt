A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates that the double-lumen catheter terminates well within the right atrium, approximately 7 cm below the expected location of the cavoatrial junction. It is unchanged in position from the prior study. The right subclavian line terminates in the mid SVC, also unchanged. The patient has been extubated. The lungs are clear. There continues to be enlargement of the right atrium. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Sternotomy cerclage wires are intact.
