Assessment is somewhat limited due to patient rotation and kyphosis. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta remains tortuous. Perihilar hazy opacities with vascular indistinctness is more pronounced on the right compared to the left, likely reflective of asymmetric mild to moderate pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Small right pleural effusion is likely present. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
