Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Bibasilar opacities, larger on the right, have minimally increased, consistent with multifocal pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. There are presumed small bilateral effusions, larger on the right side. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Sternal wires are aligned. Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are unchanged.
