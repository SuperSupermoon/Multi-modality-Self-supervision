An AICD/pacemaker generator overlies the left lung base. The leads appear intact terminating in the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged from prior. Diffuse interstitial opacities appear similar compared to prior radiograph from ___ and are consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a small effusion. Evaluation of the left base is difficult due to overlying pacemaker generator. There are bibasilar consolidations, which may reflect atelectasis, though pneumonia or aspiration are also within the differential. Central venous engorgement corresponds with findings of pulmonary edema. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited due to bibasilar opacities. No pneumothorax is evident. Median sternotomy wires appear grossly intact.
