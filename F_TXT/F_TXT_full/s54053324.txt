The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal of the NG tube. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged including relatively wide mediastinum, similar to ___ but reason unclear. Vascular congestion is minimal. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Assessment of the patient with chest CT for pre size characterization of the mediastinal widening would be beneficial on an non emergency basis.
