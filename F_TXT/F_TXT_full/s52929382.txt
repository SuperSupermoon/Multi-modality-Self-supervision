Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular central line, right subclavian PICC line, and feeding tube are unchanged in position. The more nodular patchy opacities in the right costophrenic angle and at the left lung base have somewhat improved. However, there is persistent consolidation in the retrocardiac region which may represent an area of pneumonia or lower lobe atelectasis in the setting of a layering pleural effusion. Clinical correlation is advised. The pulmonary vasculature is somewhat ill-defined and this likely reflects superimposed mild edema. No pneumothorax. The patient is status post median sternotomy with expected postoperative changes in the left hemithorax.
