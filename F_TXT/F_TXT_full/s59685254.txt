AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Heart size appears to be enlarged, which is in part exaggerated by low lung volumes. Bibasal atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusion noted. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Infectious process in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded.
