AP chest compared to ___: Large areas of opacification in the chest on ___ were due to loculated pleural effusions primarily. Both the layering and loculated components of pleural effusion in the right hemithorax have increased, although I see no radiopaque catheter on that side. The Pleurx catheter sits on the diaphragmatic surface, and the small volumes of pleural fluid dependent and fissural are unchanged. As far as one can tell, the lungs are clear but that assessment is difficult given the pleural findings. At least a lateral view would be required. Atelectasis is present at both lung bases but does not appear to be particularly severe. The heart is normal size. There is no pneumothorax.
