As compared to the previous radiograph, the extensive bilateral reticular opacities, seen in both lungs and diffusely distributed in the lung parenchyma are slightly more severe than on the previous image. Bilateral pleural effusions and subsequent areas of atelectasis have not changed since the previous exam. The moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette is constant in appearance. The left Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position.
