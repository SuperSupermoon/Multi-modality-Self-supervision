Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath with distal lead tip in the distal SVC, stable. Surgical clips are seen in the left upper chest. There is atelectasis in the lung bases and at the left mid lung field. More focal area of consolidation at the right lung base is seen with infrahilar region. Attention to this area is recommended on subsequent films to exclude a developing infiltrate. No pneumothoraces are seen.
