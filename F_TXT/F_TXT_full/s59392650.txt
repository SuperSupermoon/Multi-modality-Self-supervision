Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. There is a right arm PICC line with tip in the region of the superior vena cava. Please note a line was seen in the same position on prior exam. A dual-lead right chest wall pacer is unchanged with proximal lead in the right atrium and distal lead in the expected location of the right ventricle. The heart is mildly enlarged. Mild vascular engorgement is seen without frank pulmonary edema. An area of scarring is again noted at the left lower lobe. No large pleural effusions are seen. No pneumothorax. An azygos fissure is noted. Mediastinal contour appears stable. Bony structures are intact.
