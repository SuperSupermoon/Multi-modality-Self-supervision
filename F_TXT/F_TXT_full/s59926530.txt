Lung volumes remain low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. As compared to the previous study, there is less distention of the azygous vein and pulmonary vessels, and previously reported interstitial edema is improved as well. Patchy opacities persist in the lower lobes and likely represent patchy atelectasis. Peripheral smoothly marginated chest wall mass is present in the left mid hemithorax with associated rib destruction, seen to better detail on recent CT and in keeping with skeletal metastatic disease.
