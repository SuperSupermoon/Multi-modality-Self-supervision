Lordotic positioning. There are low inspiratory volumes. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal, but not frankly enlarged. There is upper zone redistribution and vascular plethora, consistent with mild CHF. It is possible that the right hemidiaphragm is elevated. In addition, there is atelectasis and probably a small amount of fluid at the right base. There is patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. No gross joint effusion. Note is made of surgical ___ overlying the upper abdomen.
