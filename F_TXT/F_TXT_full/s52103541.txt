The right lower lung zone atelectasis and pleural effusion are improved today; however, the right lower lobe is still not fully re-expanded. In addition, the appearance of the left lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusion is also improved. There is a new focal bulge below the level of the aortic knob, which may represent atelectatic lung compressed against the hilum. There is no pneumothorax. Support devices remain in good position.
