There is prominence of the pulmonary interstitium with increased opacity in both lower lobes. This likely represents mild pulmonary edema with asymmetric involvement of the lower lobes; however aspiration or aspiration pneumonia cannot be excluded. The heart is mildly enlarged. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax present. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
