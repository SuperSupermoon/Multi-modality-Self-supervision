There has been interval redistribution of the moderate-sized right pleural effusion, which now layers dependently rather than in the fissure. Small left pleural effusion has increased. Bibasilar consolidations most likely represent atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded. Heart size is enlarged. Aortic calcification is seen. Mediastinal contours are otherwise within normal limits. No pneumothorax is detected. Mild interstitial edema may be slightly improved. Degenerative change of the left glenohumeral joint is partially imaged.
