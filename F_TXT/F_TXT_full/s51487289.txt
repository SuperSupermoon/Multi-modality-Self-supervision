Patchy right lower lobe opacity is seen, as well as a second focus in the right mid lung zone, which may be due to atelectasis; however, underlying consolidation is not excluded. This finding is new compared to the prior study. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
