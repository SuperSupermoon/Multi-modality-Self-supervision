Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there is substantial improvement in aeration throughout the left lung. Subtotal collapse has resolved with minimal residual atelectasis of the apex and lung base. Right lung is fully expanded and clear. No obvious consolidations. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Pleural effusions small, if any.
