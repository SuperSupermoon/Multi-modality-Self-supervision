In the interim since the most recent prior examination obtained approximately one hour ago, there has been placement of a right IJ line with tip terminating at the expected region of the mid to low SVC. Mild cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular and mediastinal venous congestion are stable; interstitial edema has improved . Lungs are low in volume. There is no consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is either a healed fracture of the anterior left 4th rib, pleural calcification, or 2cm subpleural left upper lobe nodule. Conventional radiographs should be obtained when feasible. Findings were discussed by Dr ___ with a member of the ICU care team by telephone at the time of report approval.
