Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is again noted. The aortic contour remains tortuous with dilatation of the ascending aorta appearing unchanged. Lung volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular structures and probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present. 12 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left lower lobe is better demonstrated on the previous chest CT. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
