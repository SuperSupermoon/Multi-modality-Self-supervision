In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there is improved aeration at the right and left lung bases, persistent, mild pulmonary edema indicative of volume overload. Mid right lung opacities appear unchanged and may reflect pneumonia or hemorrhage as a complication of prior pigtail catheter placement. The right-sided pigtail catheter is unchanged in position, possibly within the minor fissure. Heart size is normal with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Pleural effusions small, if any. No pneumothorax. ET tube is appropriately positioned and a left-sided PICC terminates in the upper SVC. The side port of an enteric tube terminates in the stomach.
