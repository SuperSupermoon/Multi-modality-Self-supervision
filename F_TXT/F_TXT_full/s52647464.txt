AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made to the next preceding similar examination obtained seven hours earlier during the same day. On the present portable examination, the patient is moderately turned towards the right resulting in slightly different presentation of pacer, endovascular electrodes and right-sided subclavian central venous line. Position, however, is grossly unchanged and the same holds for the ETT seen to terminate some 5 cm above the level of the carina. Remarkable is that the patient has three electrodes apparently on biventricular pacing system. Pulmonary congestive vascular pattern has not changed during the interval. There is no evidence of central pulmonary edema presently. The basal densities have somewhat shifted and are more prominent on the right base whereas the left lung base clearly identifies the normal appearing contour of the diaphragm. This can be explained by patient's tilted position towards the right with corresponding shift of small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
