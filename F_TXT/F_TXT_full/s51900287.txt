Lung volumes are very low with vascular crowding in the perihilar regions. There is some increased density in the left retrocardiac region and the right infrahilar region, most likely atelectasis, although infection cannot be excluded. The heart is top normal. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. There are intact median sternotomy wires and surgical clips projecting over the mediastinum. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
