In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Atelectatic changes are seen especially at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm consistent with substantial volume loss. No definite acute pneumonia, though this could be hidden by the other pathology within the thorax.
