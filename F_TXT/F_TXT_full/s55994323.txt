The endotracheal tube is low, measuring 1.5 cm from the carina and pointing towards the right mainstem bronchus. Proximal repositioning by at least 2 cm is recommended. All other support devices including a left approach central venous catheter and nasoenteric tube are in expected unchanged position. There is progressive consolidation within the right lung base and probable new moderate effusion, findings worrisome for worsening pneumonia. Increasing opacity within the left mid and lower lung is also concerning for multifocal infection. Atelectasis of the left lower lobe remains. Upper lungs appear clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
