Heart size remains moderate to severely enlarged. The aortic knob is heavily calcified. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is worse in the interval with new bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate on the left and small on the right. No large pneumothorax is demonstrated though assessment of the left apex is somewhat obscured by external devices. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of compressive atelectasis. Superior subluxation of both humeral heads with narrowed acromiohumeral intervals indicate rotator cuff disease.
