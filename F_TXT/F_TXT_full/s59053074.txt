AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. The ET tube tip is relatively high, 7 cm above the carina, slightly above the clavicular head and should be advanced for approximately 2 cm. The right internal jugular line tip is at the low SVC. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. There is slight interval development of vascular engorgement, but no overt edema is seen. Minimal increase in left basal opacity most likely reflect vascular engorgement and unlikely to represent infectious process, but should be followed with chest radiograph within 24 hours.
