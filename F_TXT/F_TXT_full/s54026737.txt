AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained two hours earlier during the same day. On the preceding examination, the Dobbhoff line had barely entered the stomach in an unusual fashion in as much as the tip reversed towards the hiatus. On the present examination, the Dobbhoff line is now more normally aligned with its tip pointing towards the body of the stomach. Dependent on intention where to place the line, further manipulations are required.
