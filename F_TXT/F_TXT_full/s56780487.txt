An opacity in the left mid lung zone with associated rib abnormalities and a soft tissue mass is not significantly changed from the prior chest radiograph. This is consistent with the known large chest wall mass, previously characterized on the recent CT. In comparison to prior exam, the lung volumes are lower. There is a new right patchy basilar consolidation. Emphysematous changes are stable. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
