Opacification of the right mid and lower lung has worsened, however there is slight clearing of the apex. This could be due to redistribution of the moderate to large right pleural effusion. Gastric congestion in the left lung has worsened. There is no pneumothorax. Multiple surgical clips project over the mediastinum. The left internal jugular central venous catheter is in stable position in the mid SVC. Right PICC is also unchanged in the low SVC. Median sternotomy wires appear intact.
