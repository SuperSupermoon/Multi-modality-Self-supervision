Since the last exam, the patient has been extubated. The NG tube has been removed. The left apical and axillary pleural effusion with the small pneumothorax is unchanged. Stability of the left lower lung atelectasis since the last chest x ray, but that has progressed since the previous CT scan. Small radiolucencies are seen adjacent to the left border of the heart that are compatible with the laceration visible on the CT scan. Amelioration of the left lung opacities suggestive of contusion. Cardiac and mediastinal contour are normal. The left scapular fracture is unchanged.
