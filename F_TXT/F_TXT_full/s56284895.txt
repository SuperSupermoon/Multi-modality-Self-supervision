There has been interval intubation with the endotracheal tube tip terminating approximately 3 cm from the carina. The heart size remains moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged with the aorta appearing tortuous and likely dilated. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour also may in part be due to the presence of lymphadenopathy. Hazy opacifications of both lungs likely indicate the presence of moderate-sized layering bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis, but infection is difficult to exclude. Peripheral wedge-shaped opacity in the left upper lung field is re- demonstrated. There appears to be mild pulmonary edema. Assessment for pneumothorax is limited on this supine exam though no large pneumothorax is detected.
