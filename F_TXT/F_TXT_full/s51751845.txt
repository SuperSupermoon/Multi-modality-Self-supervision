AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding supine chest examination of ___. The patient was intubated and has now received a tracheostomy cannula which is seen to be in correct intratracheal position with the tube lower point terminating some 3 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. A previously existing left subclavian approach central venous line remains in unchanged position. Also, a previously existing NG tube remains in unchanged position terminating in the lower abdomen, probably in the expanded fundus of the stomach. No new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates can be identified in comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination. No pneumothorax has developed.
