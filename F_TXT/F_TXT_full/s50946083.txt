A left chest wall pulse generator with leads terminating in the right ventral and left ventricle are unchanged compared to the prior study. Median sternotomy wires appear intact. Post-CABG changes, and a right internal jugular venous line terminates in the upper right atrium. The lung volumes are slightly low, with interval removal of pleural tubes. No residual pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified. The heart is mildly enlarged, but stable compared to the prior. Nasoenteric tube has also been removed.
