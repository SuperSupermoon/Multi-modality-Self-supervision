As compared to the prior study, the current AP radiograph demonstrates overall improvement of the opacities of the lung that might reflect interval resolution of edema.

The tracheostomy and the left internal jugular line tip are unchanged in position, and the left internal jugular line should be pulled back approximately 2 cm.
