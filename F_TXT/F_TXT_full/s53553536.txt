Evaluation of the chest is limited due to low inspiratory lung volumes and slight patient rotation with resultant prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and lung markings due to under-inflation. Within this limitation, there is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected, although evaluation at the lung apices is limited due to superimposition of cervicocranial soft tissues. Streaky retrocardiac opacities most likely reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, with unfolding of the thoracic aorta and mild calcification of the aortic knob. The trachea is slightly deviated to the right by the aortic arch. There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm on this semi-erect view.
