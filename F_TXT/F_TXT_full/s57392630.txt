In comparison with the study of ___, the right chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of apical pneumothorax. Some continued subcutaneous emphysema is seen adjacent to the lower right lung and upper right abdomen. There is increasing opacification at both bases, most likely reflecting worsening atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Blunting of the costophrenic angles persists. The upper zones are essentially clear.
