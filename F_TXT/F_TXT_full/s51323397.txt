Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained. Multiple left-sided chest tubes have been removed. There is a tiny left apical pneumothorax. Persistent left upper and lower lung opacities are unchanged with basilar atelectasis. The right lung is essentially clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. Sclerotic osseous metastases are extensive.
