Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Subtle perihilar opacities may potentially be due to vascular crowding in the setting of low lung volumes, but differential diagnosis includes fluid overload and atypical pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs with improved inspiratory level would be helpful for further evaluation when the patient's condition permits.
