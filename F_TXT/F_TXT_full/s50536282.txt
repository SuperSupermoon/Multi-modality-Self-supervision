Frontal radiograph of the chest shows a new right PICC with the tip terminating in the right atrium. For more appropriate positioning, this should be retracted by approximately 5 cm. Compared to the prior study, there has been interval improvement in aeration of the bases bilaterally with slight improvement in bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar atelectasis persists. The apices are clear. Pulmonary vascular congestion is worse indicative of moderate pulmonary edema. Enlarged cardiac contour is stable.
