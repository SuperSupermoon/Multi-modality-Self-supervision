In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again, there is huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with minimal elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. This discordancy raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or even pericardial effusion. Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally is consistent with mild effusions. The right base now appears relatively clear without definite focal consolidation. Otherwise, little change.
