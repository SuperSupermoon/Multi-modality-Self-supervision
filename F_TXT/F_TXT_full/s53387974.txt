The patient is intubated with an endotracheal tube terminating 3.5 cm above the level the carina. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. A nasogastric tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm. Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study. There is persistent left lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation. The bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size. No consolidation or pneumothorax seen. Persistent prominence of the bilateral hila likely reflect pulmonary arterial enlargement.
