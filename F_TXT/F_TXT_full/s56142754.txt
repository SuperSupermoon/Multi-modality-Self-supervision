As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of two pigtail catheters in the left pleural space. There is no definite pleural line suggesting left pneumothorax but visualization is extremely difficult, given extensive soft tissue air collections and subsequent formation of multiple linear structures projecting over the thorax. On the left, the pre-existing pleural effusion appears to have slightly decreased. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
