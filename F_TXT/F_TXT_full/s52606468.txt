Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates hyperexpanded lungs. Chronic interstitial markings suggests elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The lungs are not significantly changed from the prior study. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. As before, the area of increased opacification in the left mid lung zone is worrisome for pneumonia. The endotracheal tube ends 2.5 cm from the carina. The tip of the nasogastric tube is not definitely visualized.
