Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates no marked change from yesterday's study. Again seen are bilateral lower lobe and lingular consolidation with superimposed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Given the location, aspiration etiology should be considered. The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax. A feeding tube courses into the stomach and the side port appears to be beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Left shoulder arthroplasty hardware appears unchanged.
