Right IJ Cordis is again seen with tip in the SVC. There is moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular redistribution and a moderate-sized left effusion. There is dense retrocardiac opacity that has worsened in the interval. The overlying impression is that of CHF; however, an underlying infectious infiltrate, particularly on the left cannot be excluded.
