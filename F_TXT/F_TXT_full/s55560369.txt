Frontal view of the chest was obtained. Left mid lung opacity is seen worrisome for consolidation which could be due to infection or infarct depending on the clinical scenario. There are low lung volumes. There is persistent slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle which could be due to pleural effusion or pleural thickening. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
