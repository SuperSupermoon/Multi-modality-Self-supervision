Heart size is moderately enlarged, stable. Mediastinum is stable. Pacemaker defibrillator lead terminates in the expected location of the right ventricle. Right lower lobe consolidation appears to be unchanged and might reflect a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. On the other hand, the effusion appears to be slightly increased since the prior study. There is also vascular engorgement, in particular in the perihilar area that might be consistent with mild degree of pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
