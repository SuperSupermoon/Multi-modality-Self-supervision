A right basilar pigtail drainage catheter has been repositioned/replaced medially. There is slight decrease in size of both the moderate right and small left pleural effusions. Most of the right lung base opacity can be attributed to pleural fluid and atelectasis, though, a CT would be required to quantify each. There is no pneumothorax. Heart is normal size. Left pectoral pacemaker is constant. Moderate gastric distention is noted.
