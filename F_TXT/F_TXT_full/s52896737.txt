An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.6 cm above the level of the carina. A nasoenteric tube courses below the diaphragm, and terminates in the distal stomach. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Lung volumes are somewhat low, with no focal consolidation or evidence of pulmonary edema.
