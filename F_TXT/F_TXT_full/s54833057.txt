Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.4 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses into the stomach with tip off the inferior borders of the film. Heart size is normal. The mediastinal contour is unremarkable. Mild prominence of the left hila could suggest enlargement of the pulmonary artery or underlying lymphadenopathy. Peribronchial cuffing with patchy opacities are noted in both lung bases which may reflect infection and bronchitis. More focal opacity within the retrocardiac region is also concerning for an area of infection. There is no pneumothorax. Clips are seen within the right chest wall and axillary region. Marked degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are noted. Fusion hardware is noted within the lower thoracic spine.
