CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW Compared with ___ at 11:12 a.m., the ET tube and NG tube are poorly delineated due to underpenetration and slight rotation and can therefore not be localized. A right IJ central line is present, tip over mid/distal SVC. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a small left effusion. This is similar or possibly slightly worse compared with ___ at 11:12 am. There is minimal patchy opacity at the right lung base, which appears new. No right-sided effusion. Allowing for low inspiratory volumes, there is slight vascular plethora, but I doubt overt CHF.
