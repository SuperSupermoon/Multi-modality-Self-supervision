Single AP intraoperative view of the chest provided. An ETT is noted terminating 2.7 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are low with worsened bibasilar atelectasis. A curvilinear opacity overlying the proximal trachea at the cervicothoracic junction, may represent a malpositioned orogastric tube given the history of orogastric tube placement and lack of visualization of the tube below this level. Of note, the subsequent chest radiograph shows an appropriately positioned OG tube. There is no effusion, or pneumothorax. Imaged osseous structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
