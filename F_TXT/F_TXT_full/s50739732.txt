Comparison is made to previous study from ___. The previously seen tiny apical pneumothorax in right side is no longer visualized. There remains a right apical chest tube. There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities and consolidation throughout both lung fields. The pleural effusion on the right side is increased in size as there is less definition of the right hemidiaphragm. Endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and right-sided central line are appropriately sited in unchanged position.
