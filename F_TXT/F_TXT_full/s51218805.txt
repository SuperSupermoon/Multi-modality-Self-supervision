Endotracheal tube tip is low lying, terminating approximately 1.8 cm from the carina, and should be withdrawn. Orogastric tube is seen with tip appearing to terminate in the distal esophagus, and should be advanced for optimal positioning. Lung volumes remain low. The heart size remains moderately enlarged. There is unchanged mediastinal widening, likely related to low lung volumes. There is worsening pulmonary edema, now mild to moderate in extent with probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Focal opacity is seen within the periphery of the right mid-to-upper lung field, could reflect an infectious process. No pneumothorax is clearly evident.
