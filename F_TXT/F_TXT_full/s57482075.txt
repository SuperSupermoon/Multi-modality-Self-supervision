In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are stable. Continued relatively low lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. The known tiny traumatic pneumatoceles in the right lower lobe are not well assessed on plain radiography. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small pleural effusion. The known right rib fractures are better assessed on the recent CT scan.
