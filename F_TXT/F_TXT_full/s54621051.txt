A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the superior vena cava. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An increased interstitial abnormality suggests pulmonary vascular congestion including Kerley B lines, upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vascularity, and bilateral perihilar fullness. In addition, however, there is increasing confluent right perihilar opacification which is asymmetric and may indicate a superimposed additional process such as pneumonia.
