Since the prior exam performed approximately one day prior, there is no significant change. Two right-sided chest tubes are unchanged in position. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip overlying the expected region of the stomach and the side port near the gastroesophageal junction. A left PICC terminates in the mid SVC. A right subclavian central venous catheter also terminates in the mid SVC. Cutaneous ___ are noted overlying the right chest. A left Pleurx catheter is stable. No pneumothorax. Opacities in the bilateral lower lobes and right middle lobe are unchanged, most consistent with mild pulmonary edema and atelectasis. The mediastinum is widened and stable, consistent with expected post-operative changes. The cardiac silhouette is normal. There is no pleural effusion or pulmonary edema.
