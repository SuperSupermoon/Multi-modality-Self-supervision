A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Lung volumes are lower than on the prior study. A new large opacity occupying most of the right lower lung with new retrocardiac opacity are likely pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Supervening infection cannot be excluded. Median sternotomy wires are intact, with mediastinal clips. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited by the right opacity. There is no pneumothorax.
