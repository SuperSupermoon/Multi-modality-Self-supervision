Left chest tube and right internal jugular Port-A-Cath are unchanged in position. There is expected increasing opacity at the left apex in this patient status post left upper lobectomy. Lung volumes have diminished. There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema. However, in the right upper lobe peripherally, a patchy opacity has developed and this would be concerning for aspiration or developing pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised and followup imaging should be performed as needed. Heart remains stable in size. No large pneumothorax.
