A left-sided cardiac AICD is partially imaged. The patient has had prior median sternotomy with valve replacement. A tracheostomy tube remains in place. A right-sided PICC line terminates in the low SVC. Lung volumes are low, and there is no appreciable change in left lung airspace opacities most likely corresponding to pulmonary edema. Left basilar is retrocardiac airspace opacification is most likely due to stable left lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis. Right lower lobe collapse is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged. A small layering left pleural effusion is unchanged.
