In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. Left hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable small pleural effusion. Prominence of the aortic knob is less evident, possibly because this is not an oblique image. No definite vascular congestion or acute pneumonia.
