Compared to the prior study, degree of distension of the esophagus may be somewhat less. Marked cardiomegaly is similar to the prior film. Increased retrocardiac density is also similar, though the left hemi diaphragm is very faintly visible on the current film. Again seen is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. On the right, there is some increased perihilar density, possibly an artifact of the cardiomegaly or esophageal distension -- otherwise, no focal consolidation on the right and no gross effusion. The pacemaker device and its leads are similar to the prior study. Slight difference in configuration of the right atrial lead is likely accounted for by differences in the patient rotation. On the current study, the left mainstem bronchus appears smaller in caliber than on the right, unchanged compared with the prior film. Again noted are multiple clips overlying the right upper abdomen.
