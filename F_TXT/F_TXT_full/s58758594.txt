An enteric tube is seen straddling the GE junction. The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits allowing for accentuation by low lung volumes. There is partial atelectasis and increased opacity of the right upper lobe, which could be related to aspiration. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Increased opacity is also noted at the left lower lung, and could reflect atelectatic changes or early pneumonia. There is no definite pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
