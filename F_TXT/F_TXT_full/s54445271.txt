In comparison with the study of ___, there is probably further collection of fluid within the pleural space extending along the right lateral chest wall into the apical region. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. There is suggestion of a more coalescent appearance of opacification in the left mid and upper lung zones. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could reflect a developing region of consolidation.
