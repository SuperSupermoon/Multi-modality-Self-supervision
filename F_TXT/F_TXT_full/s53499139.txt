AP chest compared to ___: Although mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema in the left lung on ___ has improved, severe consolidation in the right lung base, has worsened, in the phase of chronic moderate-to-large right pleural effusion. Findings are concerning for developing pneumonia or at least severe atelectasis. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has also increased due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion, but mediastinal venous engorgement indicates an element of right heart failure or volume overload. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC. Transvenous pacemaker leads are unchanged, but without a lateral film, I cannot determine if there is a right ventricular or coronary sinus as well as a right atrial lead. There is no pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged at 1:50 p.m.
