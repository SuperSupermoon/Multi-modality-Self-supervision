AP chest compared to ___ through ___: There is no good radiographic evidence for pathophysiologically significant interstitial lung disease. Mild interstitial edema has developed since ___, unchanged, and the left lower lobe has become consolidated. Whether this is due to pneumonia or atelectasis is not certain, but leftward shift of the lower mediastinum to suggest volume loss is dominant. There also may be a small left pleural effusion, commonly seen with persistent lower lobe collapse. Pleural effusion on the right is minimal if any. No pneumothorax. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube, left subclavian central venous line, and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements.
