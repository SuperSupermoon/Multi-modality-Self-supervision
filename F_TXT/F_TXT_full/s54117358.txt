The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable except for mildly tortuous thoracic aorta. The lungs are clear. No pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or consolidation is seen. No definite displaced rib fracture seen in this limited AP view. If there is high concern for a rib fracture, a dedicated rib series can be performed with a marker placed at the site of maximum tenderness.
