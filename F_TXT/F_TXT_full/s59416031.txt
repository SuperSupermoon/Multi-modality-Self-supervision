An NG tube is present, tip overlies the expected site of the gastric fundus the tip and sideport overlie the expected site of the gastric fundus. It appears to have been retracted and repositioned slightly higher than on the prior study. No free air seen beneath the diaphragm. ET tube tip lies approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. Right-sided pacemaker type device is similar in configuration. Equivocal tiny apical pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged, though is better defined and probably slightly smaller lower prior film. There is upper zone redistribution D views vascular plethora and interstitial and vascular blurring, consistent with CHF with interstitial edema. This is similar, but probably very slightly worse compared with the prior film. There are small bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Opacities at the right base are new compared with the prior study. Opacities at at the left base are similar.
