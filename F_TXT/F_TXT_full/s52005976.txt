This study is limited due to patient positioning. An endotracheal tube is noted in the lower trachea. A left internal jugular central venous catheter is noted with the tip at the mid SVC. An enteric tube traverses with the side-hole at the gastroesophageal junction. Evaluation of lung parenchyma and mediastinum is limited due to patient positioning. The right mediastinum and paramediastinal area are abnormal with increased opacities of unknown chronicity. Additionally, there is evidence of mild pulmonary edema. No acute fractures are identified.
