The present portable chest examination is obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with a similar preceding study of ___. The previously identified marked widening of the superior mediastinum indicating the presence of a left-sided density occupying the apical area of the left hemithorax has regressed slightly. Previously described pleural densities along the left-sided lateral and lower chest wall remain rather unchanged. As this probably represents fluid in the pleural space, it also obliterates the diaphragmatic contour. The right hemithorax remains free, and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or acute infiltrates in the right lung.
