As compared to the previous radiograph, the pleural effusions have decreased. The lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The areas of parenchymal opacities at the left persist. At the right, there is a remnant plate-like atelectasis, but otherwise, the lung is well ventilated. The monitoring and support devices are constant. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
