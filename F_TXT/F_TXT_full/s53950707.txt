In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. Continued low lung volumes with left chest tube in place. No evidence of pneumothorax, though there is again postoperative atelectasis and possible small effusion at the right base. Loculated collection of gas is seen beneath the right hemidiaphragm, somewhat more prominent than on the prior examination.
