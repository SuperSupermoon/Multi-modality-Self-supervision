Since prior exam, there are new moderate bilateral pleural effusions. Additionally, there is haziness at the right base, which could be pneumonia or aspiration. Alternatively, it could be compressive atelectasis related to the effusions. The interstitial markings are increased, likely due to mild edema and lower lung volumes. Atherosclerosis of the aortic arch is unchanged. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pneumothorax.
