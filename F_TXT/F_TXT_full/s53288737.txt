There are relatively low lung volumes and mild bibasilar atelectasis. Slight blunting of the costophrenic angles is most likely due to overlying soft tissue. No large pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette remaining mildly enlarged. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. While there may be mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement, there is no overt pulmonary edema.
