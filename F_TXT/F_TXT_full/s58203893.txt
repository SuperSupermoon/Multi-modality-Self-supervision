As compared to ___ chest radiograph, lungs remain hyperexpanded and a linear focus of atelectasis in the right lower lobe has partially cleared. A worsening opacity is present in the left retrocardiac region, now partially obscuring the descending thoracic aortic interface. This could be due to worsening atelectasis, aspiration, or a developing infectious pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
