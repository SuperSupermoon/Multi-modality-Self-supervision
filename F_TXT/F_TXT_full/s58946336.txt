CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema, which obscures detail in the lungs. Allowing for this, there is a small left pneumothorax. No definite right-sided pneumothorax is detected. There is right apical pleural thickening. There is possible pneumomediastinal air as well. There is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with a small left effusion. Hazy alveolar densities are seen in the right upper and right lower zones. Compared with ___ at 16:58 p.m., the left apical pneumothorax is probably similar. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and left pleural effusion have developed. A hazy opacity in the right upper zone is similar; opacity at the right base may be slightly worse.
