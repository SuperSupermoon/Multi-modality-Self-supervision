Large right pleural effusion layers superiorly probable because of non erect positioning. No pneumothorax. Left lung grossly clear. Heart size normal. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
