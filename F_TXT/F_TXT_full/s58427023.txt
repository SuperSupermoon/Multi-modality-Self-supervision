Left-sided PICC is again seen with tip in the upper SVC. When compared to prior, there has been interval development of a left mid-to-lower lung region of consolidation. There is also subtle opacity at the right lung base as well. Cardiac silhouette is stable in configuration. Osseous and soft tissue structures are again notable for degenerative changes at the acromioclavicular joints.
