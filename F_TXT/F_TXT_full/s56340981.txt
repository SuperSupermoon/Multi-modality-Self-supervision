Right-sided dialysis catheter is again seen, with the tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction. The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged, which is accentuated by the portable technique. There is increased retrocardiac opacity seen at the left base, which is likely related in large part to atelectasis. There is no definite pleural effusion or consolidation. No evidence of pneumothorax. Osseous structures appear grossly unremarkable, aside from degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints.
