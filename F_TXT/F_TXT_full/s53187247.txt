Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Right Port-A-Cath is again seen, terminating in the proximal SVC, stable. There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle, raising concern for a trace right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. Patchy right upper lobe opacity adjacent to the port may relate to external artifact, although an underlying consolidation is not excluded. The left lung is clear. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. Patient is status post median sternotomy. Partial right fifth rib resection and old fracture of the posterior left seventh rib again seen.
