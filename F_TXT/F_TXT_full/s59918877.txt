An endotracheal tube is unchanged in position with the tip terminating 4.5 cm above the carina. There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter with the tip terminating in the mid SVC. The appearance of the chest is otherwise unchanged with low lung volumes and opacification at the left lung base greater than the right which may represent underlying atelectasis or consolidation in the appropriate clinical context. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Prominent changes in the left lung apex are stable. Calcification at the aortic knob and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is stable. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated.
