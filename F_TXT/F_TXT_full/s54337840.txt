Since a recent radiograph of several hr earlier, a right pigtail pleural catheter is been placed with decrease in size of right pleural effusion with residual moderate to large effusion remaining, which appears partially loculated. Previously reported interstitial edema has resolved, and there is improved aeration at the left lung base with decreased pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. No other relevant change.
