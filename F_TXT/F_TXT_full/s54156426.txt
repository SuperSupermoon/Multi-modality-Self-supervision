1. Right subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. Tracheostomy is unchanged and in satisfactory position. 2. Persistent low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the right lung and at the left base which overall may have slightly improved. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity for detecting pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. No large pleural effusions.
