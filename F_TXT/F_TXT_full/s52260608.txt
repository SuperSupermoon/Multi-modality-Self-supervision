CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present. The tip is partially obscured but appears to lie approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm overlying the gastric fundus. A left subclavian line overlies the distal SVC, unchanged. No pneumothorax detected. There is cardiomegaly. Enlarged tapered pulmonary hilum raises the question of pulmonary hypertension. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Probable small bilateral effusions. Compared with ___ at 18:29 p.m., there has been slight interval clearing at the right lung base and in the left mid zone, but, overall, findings are otherwise similar.
