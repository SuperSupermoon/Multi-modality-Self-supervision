Radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessment of a feeding tube, which terminates in the distal stomach. Left PICC has been re-positioned, now terminating in the mid superior vena cava. Otherwise, little change since the recent study except for improved atelectasis at the left lung base, which is nearly resolved.
