AP chest compared to ___: The marked asymmetry, left greater than right, and progression since ___ of bibasilar consolidation suggests pneumonia. Although increased intracranial pressure, particularly when acute, can produce pulmonary edema, the patient's large heart and persistent vascular engorgement over the past four days makes it equally likely that the extensive pulmonary consolidation, if due to edema and not pneumonia, is cardiogenic. Small left pleural effusion has increased. No pneumothorax. ET tube, right internal jugular line, and nasogastric tube in standard placements respectively. Right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC.
