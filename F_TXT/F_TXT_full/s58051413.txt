Lung volumes have diminished with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. No pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity at the left base may reflect atelectasis in the setting of low volumes, although an early pneumonia should also be considered. No large effusions. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pnuemothorax.
