As compared to ___ chest radiograph, multifocal bilateral areas of consolidation and atelectasis predominantly involving the right upper and both lower lobes are remarkable for improvement in the left retrocardiac region. Some of the opacities have a nodular configuration and a dominant left lung nodule has been more fully characterized by chest CT of 1 day earlier. Correlation with that report is recommended.
