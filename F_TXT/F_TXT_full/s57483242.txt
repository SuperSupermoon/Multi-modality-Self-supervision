ET tube tip is 6.6 cm above the carinal. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right pigtail catheter is in place. Widespread parenchymal consolidations are re- demonstrated, fluctuating compared to the previous study: The right mid lung consolidation is worse but there is interval improvement of the left basal opacity. The findings might be consistent with parenchymal hemorrhage versus asymmetric pulmonary edema. Aspiration would be less likely.
