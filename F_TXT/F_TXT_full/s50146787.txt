The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 6 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach although the sidehole indicator projects over the distal esophagus. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable aside from mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. The lungs appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
