Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular central line and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position. The left chest tube remains in place. There is a persistent small left apical pneumothorax, which is better visualized on today's examination due to the patient rotation and which has likely not significantly changed. The left lung appears grossly clear. There continues to be left apical lateral pleural thickening as well as right-sided pleural thickening. Patchy opacity at the right base persists and is likely unchanged. There is also more focal patchy opacity in the right upper and mid lung which is better appreciated on the current examination due to differences in positioning but again likely is not significantly changed. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the marked patient rotation to the right. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
