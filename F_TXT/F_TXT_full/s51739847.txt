As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The right internal jugular vein catheter is unchanged. The lung volumes have overall decreased. In addition, the bilateral pleural effusions have substantially increased, leading to massive bilateral basal areas of atelectasis. The previously enlarged cardiac silhouette is no longer clearly visible. However, much better visible than on the previous examinations, is a right apical lucency, combined to a linear structure between the third and fourth posterior right rib. Together in combination, these findings reflect the presence of a small right apical pneumothorax without evidence of tension. The fact that no bullous disease was seen on the chest CT from ___ makes this diagnosis even more likely. The referring physician, ___. ___ was paged for notification at the time of dictation, 9:01, on ___.
