Lung volumes are lower which may account for an apparent increase in the already large cardiac silhouette both before and after surgery. Man may also explain possible increase in the moderate left pleural effusion adjacent to the persistently collapsed left lower lobe. Vascular crowding is more pronounced in the left lung. It is relatively unremarkable on the right. Subsegmental atelectasis at the right lung base is more pronounced. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC.
