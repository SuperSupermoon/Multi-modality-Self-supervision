1. Left-sided dual-lead pacer remains in place with its leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle respectively. Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the proximal-to-mid SVC, unchanged. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting likely within the stomach. An endotracheal tube is again identified with its tip approximately 5.5 cm above the carina, also unchanged. Status post median sternotomy with a mitral valve replacement. Overall cardiac size is stable. There has been interval improvement in aeration at the left base with some streaky residual linear opacities noted at both mid and lower lungs suggestive of patchy atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen. No pulmonary edema. No layering effusions.
