Continued interval improvement in left perihilar opacities, but worsening left retrocardiac opacity, which could reflect recurrent atelectasis in this patient with previous near-total collapse of the left lung. Within the right lung, poorly defined right upper lobe and perihilar opacities have partially cleared. Left pleural effusion appears unchanged.
