Portable upright AP chest radiograph shows pneumothorax at the right lung base where a thoracic catheter is seen just above this, unchanged in position compared to a film from several hours earlier. Increased haziness over the region suggests some fluid filling in this area. Surgical clips are seen at the right apex and despite the pneumothorax, there is volume loss on the right with mediastinal shift rightward. Subcutaneous emphysema at the base of the neck persists, but axillary air on the left appears decreased. The left lung is clear.
