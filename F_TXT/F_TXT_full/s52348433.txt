The lung volumes are low. There are patchy new opacities in the lower lungs. Most often these could be attributed to atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, but not entirely specific. In addition, the pulmonary vasculature appears indistinct and prominent suggesting fluid overload. A curvilinear line projecting over the right upper hemithorax mimics pneumothorax, although the clear presence of lung markings beyond the edge of the shadow and the lack of medial delineation of the shadow make an artifact more likely than a real pneumothorax. There is no definite pleural effusion. The gastric bubble projects over the left upper quadrant, but there is no definite free air.
