Right-sided PICC line is present, tip near SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax identified. A Dobbhoff type tube is present. Radiopaque tip appears to to have advanced and now lies beyond the field-of-view of these images. Inspiratory volumes are low, with bibasilar atelectasis similar to the prior study. There is increased retrocardiac density and blunting of the left costophrenic angle, similar to the prior study, compatible with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and possible small left effusion. No CHF. No right-sided infiltrate or effusion. Platelike atelectasis the cardiophrenic region is similar to the prior study.
