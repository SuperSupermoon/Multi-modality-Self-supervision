As compared to ___ radiograph, left PleurX catheter remains in place, and a right PleurX catheter has apparently been removed. Very small left apical pneumothorax is present, as well as a moderate left pleural effusion which has increased in size from the prior exam. Large right pleural effusion has also increased in size, previously moderate, and there is a questionable loculated hydro pneumothorax component laterally. The basilar predominant lung opacities adjacent to pleural effusions could reflect atelectasis with or without coexisting infectious consolidation.
