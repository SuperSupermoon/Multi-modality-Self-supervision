Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are unchanged. Diffuse pulmonary opacification is stable, consistent with edema, cardiogenic or otherwise. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Left-sided PICC line ends in the distal SVC. No pneumothorax.
