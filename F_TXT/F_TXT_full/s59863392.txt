The patient is status post right partial lung resection with multiple chain sutures and clips demonstrated in the right hemithorax. Evidence of right-sided volume loss is again demonstrated with rightward shift of mediastinal structures. Persistent nodular pleural thickening is seen within the right hemithorax, most pronounced along the lateral and apical regions with peripheral opacities along the right mid lung field appearing relatively unchanged from the prior exams, and compatible with recurrent disease. Widened right paratracheal stripe is compatible with underlying mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours otherwise are relatively unchanged with diffuse calcification of the thoracic aorta. The left lung is grossly clear. No pulmonary vascular congestion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. Postsurgical changes of the right rib cage are again demonstrated.
