As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been slightly pulled back. It now projects roughly 3 cm above the carina. The lung parenchyma has minimally increased in transparency, potentially reflecting improved ventilation or higher respiratory pressures. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely. Unchanged evidence of mild fluid overload and cardiomegaly.
