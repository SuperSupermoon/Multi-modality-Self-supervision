AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 5:10 p.m.: ET tube in standard placement. Heart size top normal. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is worsening radiographically, though this could be due to decrease in positive pressure ventilator support rather than interval cardiac decompensation. ET tube and right internal jugular line and upper enteric drainage tube are all in standard positions. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not significant. There is no pneumothorax.
