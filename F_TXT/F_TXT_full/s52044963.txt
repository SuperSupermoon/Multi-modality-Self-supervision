As compared to the previous radiograph from earlier the same date, an endotracheal tube now terminates 1.9 cm above the carinal and could be withdrawn a few cm for standard positioning. Nasogastric tube terminates in the region of the gastroduodenal junction. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Lungs are remarkable for heterogeneous opacities in the left mid and lower lung with slight improvement at the left base.
