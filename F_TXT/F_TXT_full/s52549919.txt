The endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating 4.3 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube courses into the stomach, with the tip off the inferior borders of the film. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. There is mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis but aspiration is not excluded. No pneumothorax is identified.
