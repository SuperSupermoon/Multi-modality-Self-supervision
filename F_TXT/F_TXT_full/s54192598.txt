In comparison with the study of ___, there are areas of increased opacification involving much of the right hemithorax, worrisome for diffuse pneumonia. Again there are relatively low lung volumes in the right hemithorax, indicating that some of this appearance could be a chronic process. Basilar opacification with obscuration of the costophrenic angles suggests superimposed pleural effusion on this side. The left lung is essentially clear. Tracheostomy tube is well-positioned.
