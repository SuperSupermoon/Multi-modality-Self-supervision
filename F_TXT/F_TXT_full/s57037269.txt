Some interval improvement in the widespread consolidation in the left lung suggests it could been due in part to recent aspiration or, less likely, asymmetric edema. However severe right lung consolidation persists and there is still the suggestion of cavitation. Lateral aspect of the right lower chest is excluded from this study, but at least a small right pleural effusion is likely. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. ET tube, left subclavian line, and esophageal drainage tube ending in the stomach are all in standard placements.
