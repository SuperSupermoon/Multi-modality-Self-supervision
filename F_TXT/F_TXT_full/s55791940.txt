A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. The lungs are underinflated, with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Streaky opacities in the left lung base greater than the right are compatible with atelectasis in this setting. The lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
