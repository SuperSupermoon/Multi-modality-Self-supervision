There has been interval removal of a right pigtail catheter and placement of a right pleural tube, ending near the right lung apex. A previously seen moderate to large lateral and inferior right pneumothorax has resolved. There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis, as before. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not significantly changed. Mediastinal contours are normal. There is biapical, right greater than left, pleuroparenchymal thickening/scarring. No definite pleural effusion.
