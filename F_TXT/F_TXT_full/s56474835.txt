The left pigtail drain has since been removed. Left lung edema is slightly less. Otherwise, no overall significant change in the radiographic appearance of the lungs since ___. Overall similar appearance of the left upper lung opacity that corresponds to a mass on CT with adjacent atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Persistent and overall similar probable small left pleural effusion and adjacent compressive atelectasis. No right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly persists. Widening of the mediastinum probably corresponds to enlarged nodes on CT.
