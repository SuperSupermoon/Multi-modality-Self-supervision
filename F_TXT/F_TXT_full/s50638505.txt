AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 4:02 a.m.: Since ___, generalized edema in the right lung has improved substantially, while right lower lobe atelectasis has worsened. Moderate left and small right pleural effusion are stable. Consolidation in the left lung is most severe in the upper lobe, improved minimally, but improved substantially in the mid lung zone. Findings are not typical of ARDS. Heart size is normal. ET tube is in standard placement. Sharp definition of the upper margin of the cuff indicates pooled secretions. The widening of the trachea at the cuff level reflects wide trachea prior to intubation, perhaps tracheomalacia.
