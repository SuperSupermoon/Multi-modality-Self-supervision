AP supine portable chest radiograph provided. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 3.3 cm above the carina. The patient is slightly rotated to the right. Lung volumes are low with basilar platelike atelectasis. The heart size appears within normal limits. The mediastinum appears widened, though this is likely due to portable technique and rotation. No supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax. Bony structures appear intact. Inferior spurring at the right glenohumeral joint is noted.
