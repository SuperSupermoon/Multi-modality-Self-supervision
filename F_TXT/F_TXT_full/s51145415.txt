Single AP semi-upright portable view of the chest was provided. Patient is rotated to her right which somewhat limits the evaluation. The lungs appear clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. There is some prominence of the right paratracheal stripe which could reflect mediastinal lymphadenopathy in this patient with known metastatic lung cancer. The heart size appears normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen though the left CP angle and the inferior right CP angle are excluded. The imaged osseous structures appear intact.
