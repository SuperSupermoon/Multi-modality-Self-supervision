The examination is limited secondary to patient's inability to cooperate. The left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film. There is near-complete opacification of the right lung base, likely a combination of new pleural effusion and consolidation. Density in the retrocardiac region is less severe than the right. There is increased central pulmonary vascular congestion as compared to prior. The thoracic aorta appears tortuous. Cardiac contours remain enlarged.
