A lordotic projection was obtained. Heart size appears mildly enlarged, similar to the previous study. The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged. There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution compatible with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No definite focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, however, the right costophrenic angle is not completely encompassed in the field of view. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
