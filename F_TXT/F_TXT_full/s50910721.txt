CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An NG tube is present -- the tip is obscured by overlying soft tissue structures, traced only to the lower mediastinum, and does not clearly cross the GE junction. If clinically indicated, this could be further assessed with an additional view centered at the level of the diaphragms, with increased penetration. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, unchanged. There is bilateral pulmonary vascular plethora, likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Some increased retrocardiac density is also present, unchanged. No gross effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
