Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of view. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the proximal right internal jugular vein. An additional linear tubular structure courses over the right hemi thorax crossing over to project over the left neck, unclear whether this is a internal or external to the patient. There are low lung volumes. There is diffuse opacity projecting over the right lung. Differential diagnosis includes aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, infection.
