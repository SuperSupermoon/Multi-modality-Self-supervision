CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Lordotic positioning. An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 4.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm off film. A right subclavian PICC line is present, tip over mid/lower SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. There are low inspiratory volumes. There is patchy opacity at both bases consistent with collapse and/or consolidation. No gross effusion. No overt CHF. Compared with ___ at 15:19 a.m. and allowing for differences in positioning, there has been partial interval clearing at the left base, with new visualization of the left hemidiaphragm. The right base is probably similar, allowing for positional differences.
