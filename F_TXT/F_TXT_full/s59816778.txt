Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. A drain/chest tube overlies the right hemithorax. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, with possible partial right lower lobe collapse. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen. There is no definite pneumothorax. Possible trace right pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are more prominent as compared to the prior study, although this may relate to AP, portable technique and lower lung volumes.
