No previous images. The chest tube extends to the apical region, then points downwards so that the tip lies at the level of the aortic arch. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is some gas in the subcutaneous soft tissues along the left lateral chest wall and in the lower neck. Low lung volumes may account for some of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. There is engorgement of the pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Bibasilar atelectatic change is seen. There is evidence of a spinal fusion.
