As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The right central venous access line remains unchanged. The pre-existing large predominantly perihilar left-sided opacity has substantially decreased in extent. A minimal perihilar right opacity and a relatively large retrocardiac atelectasis persist. In addition, there is unchanged mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly with minimal signs of fluid overload. No pneumothorax.
