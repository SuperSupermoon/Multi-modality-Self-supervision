An AICD generator overlies the left chest wall and is only partially imaged. A single lead appears intact and is in unchanged expected position. There is new mild pulmonary edema. Overall aeration of the left lung base is decreased compared to recent prior; the opacity may be due to asymmetric edema or interval development of aspiration/pneumonia. The left base can be reassessed after diuresis. The right lung appears clear. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged compared to prior examination.
