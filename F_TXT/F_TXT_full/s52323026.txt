Right IJ line has been withdrawn, probably ends in the upper atrium since it is still 7 cm below the level of the carina, and would need to be further withdrawn 3 cm to reposition it low in the SVC. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Right upper lobe atelectasis has almost entirely cleared. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube in standard placement. Upper enteric drainage tube passes into a non-distended stomach. Intestinal segments in the upper abdomen are still moderately-to-severely distended.
