Comparison is made with prior study from ___. There is a new tracheostomy tube in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Mild vascular congestion is increased. Bibasilar opacities are unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also stable. There is no evident pneumothorax. The opacities in the lower lobes may reflect atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded.
