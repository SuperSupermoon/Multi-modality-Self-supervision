A new pigtail catheter has been placed into the right pleural space with substantial decrease in a pleural effusion. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There are probably trace pleural effusions bilaterally and persistent opacities at the lung bases, more extensive on the left than right, likely due to atelectasis. There is moderate pleural thickening at each lung apex and a few calcified nodules in the upper lungs, greater on the right than left, most consistent with small calcified granulomas. There are again non-displaced fractures involving the right posterior lateral third and fifth ribs. Subtle fractures of the fourth and sixth ribs are also possible.
