In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. No evidence of pneumothorax. Continued low lung volumes which may account for some of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. The opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and there is blunting of the costophrenic angle consistent with pleural effusion. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could well reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude a supervening pneumonia at the left base. Subclavian line again extends to the arch of the left brachiocephalic vein. The dilatation of the gas-filled stomach has cleared.
