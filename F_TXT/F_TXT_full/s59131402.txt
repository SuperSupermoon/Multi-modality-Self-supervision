1. Interval appearance of increasing bibasilar airspace opacities which likely represent worsening pneumonia or aspiration, although given underlying emphysema, pulmonary edema should also be considered. The upper lungs appear grossly clear. Streaky linear opacity in the right mid lung likely reflects scarring. There is likely a small left effusion. The patient is status post median sternotomy with valve replacement. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the predominantly left lower lobe airspace process. No pneumothorax. There is a thoracolumbar curvature with calcification of the descending aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
