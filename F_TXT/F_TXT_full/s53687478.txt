Endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina, likely related to chin positioning. A right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid-to-low SVC. A right PICC line terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. An enteric line courses below the diaphragm, tip is not included in this examination. Note is made of decreased lung volume on the right. Persistent retrocardiac and left lower lobe opacities are likely related to collapse of the left lower lung and overlying pleural fluid. No new focal consolidations or pneumothorax.
