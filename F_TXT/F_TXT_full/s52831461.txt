Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip is in the low SVC. No pneumothorax is identified. In particular, the previously noted right apical pneumothorax is not clearly visualized on the current exam. There is persistent pneumomediastinum. Heart size is mildly enlarged, and the mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pneumatocele within the right lung base is similar compared to the previous exam. Streaky opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. An enteric tube is noted which courses through the stomach, off the inferior borders of the film. Skin ___ are seen overlying the midline upper abdomen.
