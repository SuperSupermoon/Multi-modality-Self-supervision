Single frontal view of the chest. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Increased heterogeneous, right greater than left, lung opacities in association with thickening of the right horizontal fissure and pulmonary vascular congestion are consistent with pulmonary edema. Small pleural effusions are likely present bilaterally. No pneumothorax. A right lateral approach cholecystostomy catheter is incompletely imaged.
