In comparison with study of ___, the NG tube has been pushed forward so that the side port lies distal to the esophagogastric junction. Endotracheal tube and right subclavian catheter are in good position. Little change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is evidence of some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure with hazy opacification at the right base that could reflect some layering effusion. Retrocardiac opacification with obliteration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable small effusion.
