There is substantial free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm. The lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Patchy basilar opacities seen on each side can probably be attributed to minor atelectasis. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear. There is no definite pleural effusion although small pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude, given technique. There is no pneumothorax.
