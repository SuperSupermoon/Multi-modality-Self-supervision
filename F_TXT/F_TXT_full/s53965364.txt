As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased, reflecting improved ventilation. Although minimal atelectasis might be present at the lung bases, there is no clear sign of pneumonia. No pleural effusion. Scoliosis with subsequent asymmetry of the rib cage. Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
