Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration. There is no overt sign of pneumonia or CHF, though there may be mild interstitial prominence which could represent edema in the right clinical setting. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Mediastinal contour appears grossly unremarkable. Bony structures are intact.
