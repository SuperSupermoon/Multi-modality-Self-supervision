Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is a left-sided central line with distal lead tip in the mid SVC. Heart size is within normal limits. There is a left retrocardiac opacity. There is some prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings likely representing some fluid overload. There are again seen fractures of several of the left-sided chest, ribs as well as of the scapula, which appear stable. No pneumothoraces are identified.
