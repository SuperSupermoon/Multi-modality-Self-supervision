The tip of the endotracheal tube appears low, less than 2 cm above the carina. New since the earlier study are bilateral thoracic catheters as well as 2 mediastinal chest tubes projected over the heart. Small medial apical pneumothorax is suggested but not definite. Double density over the upper left cardiac border corresponds to known hematoma. Feeding tube has been removed. The nasogastric tube remains in place with the tip and side hole both below the left hemidiaphragm. The left hemidiaphragm remains obscured. Vague opacity in the right mid lung field represents fluid in the fissure. Marked thoracic dextroscoliosis.
