In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends into the stomach with the side hole at about the level of the esophagogastric junction. If clinically possible, the tube should be pushed forward several cm at least. There is some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta. Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small pleural effusions.
