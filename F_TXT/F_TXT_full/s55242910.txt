Evaluation is limited due to significant patient rotation at the neck. Within this limitation, an endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating 4.5 cm above the carina. A right Port-A-Cath is in place with the tip in the proximal right atrium. The inspiratory lung volumes are low with resultant bronchovascular crowding and exaggeration of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. No sizable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen on this supine AP view. The left lung base is opacified, which likely reflects atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. There is pulmonary vascular congestion and Kerley B line suggesting mild pulmonary interstitial edema. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
