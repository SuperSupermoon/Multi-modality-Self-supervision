In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the mid to upper stomach. The side hole is about at the level of the esophagogastric junction and the tube should be pushed forward somewhat. There is again diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacification, though somewhat less than on the previous study. In view of the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, this most likely represents improving pulmonary edema. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Left subclavian catheter remains in place.
