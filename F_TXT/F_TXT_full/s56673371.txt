The patient is status post previous median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery and recent cervical spine surgery. Heart is upper limits of normal in size with left ventricular configuration, and mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Within the lungs, there are no focal areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Small rounded density in right lung base may reflect a calcified granuloma or a vessel viewed end on.
