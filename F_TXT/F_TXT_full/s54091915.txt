AP chest compared to ___: No appreciable right pleural effusion with pigtail pleural catheter still present at the base of the right lung. No pneumothorax. Right basal consolidation which developed during the course of ___ has improved, probably due to resolution of a component of atelectasis. There is worsening opacification at the base of the left lung, either pneumonia or hemorrhage. Moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding. No pneumothorax. Course of the transjugular Swan-Ganz catheter is little uncertain, but it probably ends in a small branch of the right descending pulmonary artery, no less than 4 cm beyond standard positioning. Right jugular introducer ends low in the SVC. Left PIC line can be traced as far as the left brachiocephalic vein, but the tip is indistinct. ET tube in standard placement.
