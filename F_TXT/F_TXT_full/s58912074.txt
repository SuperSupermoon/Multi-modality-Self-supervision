Spinal hardware overlies the upper thoracic vertebrae. An endotracheal tube is seen, unchanged in position with the tip at the thoracic inlet. There continues to be improving aeration in the right lung but with persistent pleural thickening and patchy opacities throughout the right lung which may reflect metastatic disease, superimposed infectious process or re-expansion pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation is advised. Left lung is without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. There is a stable 1.5 cm nodular opacity in the left lower lung, which is suspicious for pulmonary metastasis, especially when correlated with a CT dated ___. No pneumothorax is seen.
