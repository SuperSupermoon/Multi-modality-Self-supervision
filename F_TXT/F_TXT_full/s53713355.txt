The cardiac silhouette is stable. There is increasing opacity in the right mid lung and right upper lobe which could be secondary to worsening atelectasis although superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There is persistent right pleural effusion. Subcutaneous emphysema of the right chest wall is again identified.
