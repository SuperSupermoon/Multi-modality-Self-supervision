The left hemodialysis catheter terminates in the mid right atrium. The mediastinum is normal. The heart silhouette is obscured by bilateral pleural effusions and is not adequately evaluated. Large bilateral pleural effusions are not appreciably changed. A coarse calcification in the right hilum is likely a calcified lymph node. There is no apical pneumothorax.
