Comparison is made to prior study from ___. Tracheostomy tube whose distal tip is 3 cm above the carina is appropriately sited. There is a left-sided central line with distal lead tip in the proximal right atrium. This could be pulled back 2 to 3 cm for more optimal placement. Heart size is within normal limits. Lungs are clear. There are no pneumothoraces.
