1. There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema. The patient is markedly rotated to the left, limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. The aorta appears unfolded and tortuous. The retrocardiac area is difficult to assess and is obscured by the heart due to patient rotation. Lung volumes are relatively low. No pneumothorax.
