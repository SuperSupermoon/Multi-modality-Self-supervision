As before, there are four sternotomy wires, scattered right hemithoracic surgical clips, and skin ___ along the lateral aspect of the right chest wall. There has been a marked increase in what is now near-complete homogeneous opacification of the right hemithorax with a slight rightward shift of the mediastinal structures, consistent with atelectasis in the setting of interval mucus plugging. A portion of the known moderate right hydropneumothorax is visualized at the right lung apex. Interstitial opacities throughout the left lung, more prominent in its mid-to-upper portion, are not significantly changed, consistent with mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. There is no left pleural effusion. The heart size is difficult to assess but is likely unchanged. Again noted are right-sided rib defects as well as resection of the distal portion of the right clavicle.
