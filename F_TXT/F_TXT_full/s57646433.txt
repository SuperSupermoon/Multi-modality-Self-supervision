A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. Comparison was made to prior study at 1:00 a.m. An endotracheal tube has been inserted 5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube extends inferiorly out of the field of view. Opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle and left retrocardiac space is unchanged. There is also bibasilar linear reticular opacities suggesting chronic lung disease. Lung volumes are low. The aortic arch remains enlarged and calcified.
