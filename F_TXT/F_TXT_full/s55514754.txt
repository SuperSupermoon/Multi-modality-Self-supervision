A pigtail pleural catheter has been placed at the base of the left chest with marked reduction in a large left-sided pleural effusion. A small left apical pneumothorax is present; the pleural edge is located 8 mm from the chest wall. The heart is markedly enlarged with streaky residual left basilar opacification, although probably explained by atelectasis. The right lung remains clear aside from mild interstitial prominence in the lower lung most suggestive of mild vascular congestion, similar to the earlier exam.
