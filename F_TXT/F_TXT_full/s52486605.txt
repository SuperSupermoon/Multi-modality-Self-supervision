In comparison with ___ study there is significant increase in volume loss of the left lung and mild leftward mediastinal shift suggestive of airway obstruction (mucous plugging). Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is also seen. ETT appears to terminate approximately 3.8 cm superior to the carina. A left PICC line is unchanged in position and terminates at the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is seen.
