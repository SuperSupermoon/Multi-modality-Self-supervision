The patient is intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above the level the carina. A nasoenteric tube is in-situ, the tip is not visualized lies below the left hemidiaphragm. A tunneled right internal jugular dialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium. A right internal jugular vascular access catheter terminates in the SVC. There are persistent bilateral opacities predominately perihilar distribution consistent pulmonary edema. Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature persists. Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis. An apparent opacity in the left upper lobe is also unchanged compared to the prior study but new compared earlier studies. This is not clearly seen to be on the patient's skin and would be better evaluated with a CT of the chest.
