There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 3.2 cm above the carina. The side port of the nasogastric tube is just at the GE junction and this could be advanced 5-10 cm for more optimal placement. There is a right IJ central line with the distal lead tip in the distal SVC. There is some prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema. There is a small left retrocardiac opacity and small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothoraces are seen.
