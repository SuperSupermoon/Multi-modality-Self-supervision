Heart size is stably enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is mild fullness of the hilum with increased reticular opacities, likely due to increased pulmonary pressure. No large effusions are seen. There is no pneumothorax. A calcified nodule projects over the left lung apex, unchanged from prior exams. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted. Vascular calcifications are seen.
