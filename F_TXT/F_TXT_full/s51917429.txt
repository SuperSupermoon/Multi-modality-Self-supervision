CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW, LORDOTIC POSITIONING. A left-sided chest tube is present. There is subcutaneous emphysema along the left chest wall. Left mediastinal surgical clips again noted. There is probable small pneumothorax at left lung apex. There is retrocardiac density with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, increased compared with the prior stidy. This likely represents a combination of elevated left hemidiaphragm, left lower lobe collapse/consolidation, and a small left effusion. The right lung is grossly clear, without pneumothorax, frank consolidation or gross effusion. Minimal linear atelectasis in the right mid zone is noted. There s possible minimal upper zone redistribution, but I doubt overt CHF. Compared with ___ at 14:13 p.m., the ET tube has been removed. The tiny left pneumothorax is new or better seen. The opacification at the left base is new. Findnigs were discussed with Dr. ___ at approximately 1:40 pm on the day of the exam (___, phone).
