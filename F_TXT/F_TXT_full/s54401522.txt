Single AP view of the chest was reviewed. Severe cardiomegaly is again seen. A left axillary dual lead pacemaker defibrillator is present with leads terminating in unchanged positions in the right atrium and right ventricle. Indistinctness and enlargement of the hila with promiment interstitial markings is consistent with pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
