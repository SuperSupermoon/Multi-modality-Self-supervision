1. A feeding tube remains coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Interval extubation and removal of the right internal jugular introducer. The patient is status post median sternotomy with overall stable post-operative cardiac enlargement and stable mediastinal contours. There continues to be retrocardiac consolidation likely reflecting a combination of compressive atelectasis and layering effusion. Linear opacities at the right base are again seen and may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema on the current examination. No pneumothorax.
