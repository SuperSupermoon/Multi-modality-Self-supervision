A single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right internal jugular line passing into the upper atrium, as well as a tracheostomy tube terminating 5.6 cm above the carina. Aortic endografts are seen. The cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits. Pleural effusions are small, if present at all. Pulmonary edema, previously somewhat improving, now appears slightly worse than on prior exam.
