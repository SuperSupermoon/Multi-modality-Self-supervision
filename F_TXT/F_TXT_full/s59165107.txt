As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube is positioned 2 high and projects approximately 7 cm above the carina. The tube should be advanced by 2-3 cm. The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not visualized on the image. Unchanged normal position of the right internal jugular vein catheter. At increased lung volumes, there is unchanged evidence of a left pleural effusion and a subsequent retrocardiac atelectasis. The diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities, massive in severity, could have minimally increased, some of them appear rounded and could reflect septic emboli. No pneumothorax.
