The contour abnormality in the left mediastinum obscuring the main pulmonary artery and descending thoracic aorta is again noted but slightly less prominent. As previously stated this could reflect a mediastinal fluid collection or pseudoaneurysm. There is mild pulmonary edema decreased compared to prior study and a similar right parenchymal opacity. The right internal jugular sheath is unchanged. There are bibasilar chest tubes. No pneumothorax is noted. Again noted is a right calcified hilar lymph node.
