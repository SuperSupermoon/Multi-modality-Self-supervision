As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The tip of the endotracheal tube is also unchanged, and apparent intubation of the right main bronchus is caused by overlay of an exterior part of the tube. Unchanged relatively diffuse bilateral pleural effusions with parenchymal opacities at both lung bases, left more than right. Interspersed areas of bronchiectasis suggest that these opacities are not recent. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities. Unchanged pleural and parenchymal calcifications. No pneumothorax.
