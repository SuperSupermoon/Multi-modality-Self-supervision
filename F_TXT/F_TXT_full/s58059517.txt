Pulmonary vascular congestion persists and there is probably borderline edema, best seen in the left lung. Right lower lobe still collapsed. Right upper lobe hyperinflated. Right middle lobe probably incompletely expanded. ET tube in standard placement. Left internal jugular line ends in the left brachiocephalic vein. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax. Small right pleural effusion is probably still present.
