AP chest compared to ___ and ___: The patient is rotated to the right, partially obscuring the lower lobe. There is suggestion of mild peribronchial opacification. I would be more confident in excluding pneumonia if conventional radiographs were obtained. There is no pulmonary edema. Right hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated. There is no indication of substantial pleural effusion. Previous vascular congestion has improved, but moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. A right PIC or subclavian line ends in the right brachiocephalic vein. No pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged at 12:00 noon.
