Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Interval extubation. Right internal jugular dual-lumen catheter and left internal jugular central line are unchanged in position. Bilateral layering effusions with bibasilar patchy opacities favoring compressive atelectasis although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Overall improved aeration in the upper lungs. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stably enlarged.
