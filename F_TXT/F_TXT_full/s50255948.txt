There is prominent cardiomegaly, with evidence for left atrial and right ventricle enlargement, unchanged. Note is made of background bullous changes. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is patchy opacity at the left base with tenting of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Compared with ___, the right IJ sheath has been removed and there has been slight interval improvement of the opacities at the left base.
