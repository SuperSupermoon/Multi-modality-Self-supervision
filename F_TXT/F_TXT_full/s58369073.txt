An endovascular graft at the aortic knob is unchanged in position. The patient is status post median sternotomy and mitral and tricuspid valve replacement. There is a right IJ terminating at the upper SVC and a left subclavian terminating at the mid SVC. The endotracheal tube terminates 8.4 cm above the carina. The lungs are slightly underinflated relative to the ___ radiographic study. There remains a small right pleural effusion which is unchanged. Bilateral pulmonary opacities appear stable, likely reflecting mild interstitial edema and atelectasis. No focal consolidation is seen.
