Two frontal images of the chest were obtained. Interpretation is very limited on this study secondary to extreme rotation of the patient. There is a stable small layering right pleural effusion again seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be evaluated given the patient's rotation. Mild vascular congestion is again seen which appears unchanged. NG tube seen with tip below the diaphragm. No pneumothorax is seen.
