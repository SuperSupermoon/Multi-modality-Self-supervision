Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, a Swan-Ganz catheter is been placed, with tip of the catheter projecting approximately 3.7 cm distal to the central right hilum, likely within a segmental branch. Exam is otherwise remarkable for improving pulmonary edema, with residual heterogeneous lower lung opacities worse on the left than the right. Although potentially due to asymmetrical edema, coexisting infection in the left lower lobe should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Right pleural effusion is nearly resolved, and a small to moderate left pleural effusion persists with possible loculation laterally.
