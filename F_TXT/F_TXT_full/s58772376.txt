Lung volumes are low with patchy opacities at the lung bases. More reticular opacities are consistent with chronic fibrotic changes. No supine evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is seen. The heart size is within normal limits. An endotracheal tube is in standard position with tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. An esophageal catheter is in place with tip and side port within the stomach.
