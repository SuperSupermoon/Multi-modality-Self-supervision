Surgical clips project over the left axilla. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is again mild-to-moderate relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Patchy opacity projects over the right mid lung, potentially an early focus of pneumonia, but not very striking.
