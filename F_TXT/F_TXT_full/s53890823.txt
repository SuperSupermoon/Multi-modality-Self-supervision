Comparison is made with prior study of ___. The patient is very rotated. This limits the evaluation of this radiograph. Allowing this limitation, small left pleural effusion is probably unchanged, though it appears to be loculated in the upper hemithorax. Cardiomediastinal contours cannot be evaluated. There are low lung volumes. Left basal chest tube remains in place. Left lower lobe opacities are probably unchanged. Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC. There is no evident pneumothorax. The right lung is grossly clear.
