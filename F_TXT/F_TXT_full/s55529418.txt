Pleural catheters remain in place in the right hemithorax, with persistent moderate right apical pneumothorax and slight increase in size of a moderate loculated right basilar hydropneumothorax. Persistent volume loss in the right hemithorax with associated collapse of the right middle lobe and partial atelectasis of the right lower lobe. Slight improved aeration in the left lower lobe with a small residual pleural effusion and adjacent minor left basilar atelectasis. Unchanged widening of mediastinal contours, likely due to known lymphadenopathy on prior chest CT of ___.
