The new NG tube courses through a tortuous esophagus and terminates below the diaphragm, likely within the gastric fundus. The side port remains within the distal esophagus and the tube should be advanced approximately 8 cm for optimal placement. Decreased lung volumes compared to the recent prior study are associated with increased bibasilar opacities likely a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Superimposed consolidation is possible. A curvilinear calcific density along the right heart border corresponds to a calcified ascending aorta and based on comparison to the ___ CTA. There is no pneumothorax.
