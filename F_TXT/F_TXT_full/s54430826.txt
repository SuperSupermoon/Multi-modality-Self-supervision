Extremely low lung volumes. Heart size is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are likely normal, allowing for patient rotation. The patient is status post cardiac valve replacement with median sternotomy wires. There is diffuse lung disease, likely edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. As before, partially visualized VP shunt.
