Comparison is made with prior study performed 12 hours earlier. Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged. Diffuse opacities, worse in the lower lobe are unchanged, suggesting that these abnormalities likely represent pneumonia and less likely pulmonary edema. There are no new lung abnormalities, pneumothorax, or large pleural effusions.
