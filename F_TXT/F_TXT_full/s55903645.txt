There is a new, moderate to large right pneumothorax. When compared to the prior chest radiograph, there is a small amount of mediastinal shift toward the left. Overall pulmonary interstitial opacities are essentially unchanged, but accentuated on the right by the pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable. No pleural effusion. A right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the low SVC. An endotracheal tube terminates 6.3 cm above the carina. Bilateral pigtail pleural drains are noted.
