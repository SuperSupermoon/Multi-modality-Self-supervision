Allowing for differences in lung volumes, pulmonary vasculature congestion is similar to the prior study. A heterogeneous opacity in the right upper lobe is again demonstrated, and could be due to pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Combined pleural and parenchymal opacifications in the lower left hemithorax have slightly worsened in the interval. Otherwise, no relevant short-interval change.
