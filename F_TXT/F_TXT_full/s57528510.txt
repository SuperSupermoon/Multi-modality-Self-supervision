A right pigtail catheter is unchanged. The remnant effusion is stable. Again noted is mild pulmonary edema, although improved since the previous exam especially in the right lung. Opacity in the left mid lung may represent asymmetric edema, however this seems less likely given the improvement in edema in the right lung. The cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Median sternotomy wires are intact.
