In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the mid body of the stomach. The side port is probably close to the esophagogastric junction and the tube should be pushed forward at least 5 cm to be in more optimal position. There is increased haziness on the right, consistent with layering pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis at the base. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and there is probably a small effusion on this side as well.
