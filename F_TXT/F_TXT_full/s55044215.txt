Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. There has been interval appearance of bibasilar patchy airspace disease as well as a layering left effusion. Findings most likely reflect atelectasis given the relatively rapid interval change, although pneumonia should also be considered. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient positioning.
