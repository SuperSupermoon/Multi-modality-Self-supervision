In comparison with study of ___, the PICC extends only to the left brachiocephalic vein before its junction with the superior vena cava. Continued low lung volumes may account for some of the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Bibasilar opacification most likely reflects atelectatic changes. Possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. The pulmonary vascular congestion is less prominent than on the prior study.
