Left-sided Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position. Lungs are without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. 3mm nodular opacity in the left peripheral lower lung corresponds to a calcified nodule on recent chest CT ___ and therefore is consistent with a granuloma. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
