An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. An OG type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A left IJ central line tip overlies the upper right atrium. Again seen is moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly, similar to the prior film. Sternotomy wires and prosthetic valve again noted. Increased opacity at the left lung base with obscuration of the left costophrenic angle is similar to the prior film. The previous film showed some patchy alveolar opacity at in the left mid zone laterally. This area is obscured by overlying iatrogenic structures on the current film --___, it appears at least partially improved if not completely resolved. There is a small to moderate layering right pleural fusion, which is probably slightly larger, allowing for differences in technique. There is upper zone redistribution with diffuse vascular blurring, and atelectasis the right lung base.
