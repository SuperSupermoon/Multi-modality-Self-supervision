Study is very limited due to volume loss along the right chest as well as pleural calcifications. Increased density throughout the entire right lung thus underlying infiltrate or edema would be difficult to exclude. There is likely a small right pleural effusion. The left lung appears relatively clear without focal consolidation or definite pulmonary edema. Heart size demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall, these findings appear relatively stable.
