Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 6.8 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip is within the stomach, however the side port lies proximal to the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced by least 10 cm for optimal positioning. Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Hyperinflation of the lungs with emphysematous changes in the upper lobes are again noted. Lungs are clear however the extreme right lung apex is excluded from the field of view. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Patient is status post gastric banding which has a somewhat different configuration compared to the prior chest radiograph, appearing circular, likely due to differences in patient positioning.
