As compared to the most recent prior study, the right PICC has been retracted with the tip still terminating in the proximal right atrium, which should be retracted 3-3.5 cm to place in the low SVC. The appearance of the chest is otherwise unchanged. The lung volumes remain low with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax. A small right pleural effusion is suggested. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. The mediastinal contours are prominent but unchanged with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
