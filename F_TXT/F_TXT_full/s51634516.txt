Compared with the most recent radiograph, left lower lobe opacity compatible with infection is grossly unchanged. There is minimal right basilar atelectasis. Lobulated contour abutting the aortic arch and projecting over the AP window is compatible with thoracic aortic aneurysm and prior dissection. Intact median sternotomy wires. No pneumothorax. Tiny, if any, right pleural effusion.
