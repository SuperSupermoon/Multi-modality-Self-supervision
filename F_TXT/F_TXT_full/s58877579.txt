NEW RIGHT transjugular pulmonary artery fluid station catheter ends at the origin of the right descending pulmonary artery, standard placement. There is no pneumothorax OR associated mediastinal widening or pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly is long-standing. Previous bilateral perihilar distribution of consolidation is not as obvious today, because of definite improvement on the left, mild improvement on the right, and more extensive adjacent consolidation in the right lung. The time course of changes still favors pulmonary edema, but hemorrhage and pneumonia are not excluded. Transvenous right atrial biventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in their respective positions. A right PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
