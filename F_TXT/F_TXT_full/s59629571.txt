Pigtail right pleural catheter is unchanged in position, and a component of the distal coiled aspect of the catheter may be external to the pleural space as described previously. Moderate-to-large multiloculated right pleural effusion with several small loculated hydropneumothorax component appears similar to the prior study. Heterogeneous opacities in the right lung appear slightly improved in the mid and lower lung regions. Left lung is clear except for minor atelectasis at the left base.
