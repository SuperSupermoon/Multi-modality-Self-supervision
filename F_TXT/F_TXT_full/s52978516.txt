The right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is again seen. The tip lies more distal, compared with the film from 1 day earlier, now lying relatively distal over the right pulmonary artery, possibly at the origin of an inferior lobe vessel. No pneumothorax detected. Again seen is a left-sided pacemaker/ tib-fib related type device, with 3 leads, unchanged. There is very slight upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. Again seen is cardiomegaly probably slightly improved. No focal infiltrate or effusion.
