Tracheostomy tube again noted. Status post sternotomy, with prosthetic valve. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged allowing for differences in positioning. Again seen is the left chest tube. Also again seen is the left apical pneumothorax. An additional small vertically oblong lucency along the left chest wall adjacent to the chest tube is suggestive of an additional site of a small localized pneumothorax. As before, there is increased retrocardiac density, partial obscuration left hemidiaphragm, and opacity in the left costophrenic angle. Much of this likely represents collapse and/or consolidation. The possibility of a small amount of pleural fluid on the left side cannot be excluded. On the right, there is mild vascular blurring. Minimal density in the right midlung likely represents platelike atelectasis. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle is compatible with a small amount of pleural fluid, newly visible on the current study. There is atelectasis the right lung base, unchanged. Mild vascular plethora is seen in both upper zones and there is possible minimal vascular blurring, without other evidence of CHF.
