Right infrahilar opacity with partial obscuring of the right heart border is perhaps similar to ___ but slightly worse compared to ___, suggesting ongoing aspiration and and/or pneumonia. Retrocardiac opacity with silhouetting of the lateral border of the thoracic aorta as well as left hemidiaphragm is overall unchanged to slightly improved compared to the prior exam and may reflect atelectasis and/or consolidation. The heart is top-normal in size, unchanged. Lung volumes are slightly low and prominence of the pulmonary vessels may be secondary to crowding effect. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated and may suggest some component of right lower lung atelectasis. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusion.
