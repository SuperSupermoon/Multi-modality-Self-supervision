There appears to be near opacification of the left lung, likely secondary to patient's known malignancy. The extent of the patient's malignancy is better seen on the prior CT from ___. The right lung also demonstrates nodules that are better evaluated on the prior CT. There is a focal opacity along the right minor fissure, which did not have a CT correlate, and may be a focal consolidative process, however malignancy cannot be ruled out. There is no pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.
