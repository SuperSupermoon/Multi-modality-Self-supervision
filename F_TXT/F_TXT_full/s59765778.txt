A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The lungs are well expanded and clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Blunted right costophrenic angle likely reflects pleural scarring. There is minimal left basilar atelectasis. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. No displaced rib fracture is seen. No free air under the diaphragm. Partially imaged in anterior cervical spinal fusion hardware.
