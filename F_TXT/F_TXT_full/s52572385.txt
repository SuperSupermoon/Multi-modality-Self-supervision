Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There is linear lateral left lower lobe opacity likely representing atelectasis/scarring. No focal consolidation seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Partially imaged residual contrast is seen in the bowel in the left upper quadrant presumed from upper GI series with small bowel follow-through performed one day prior.
