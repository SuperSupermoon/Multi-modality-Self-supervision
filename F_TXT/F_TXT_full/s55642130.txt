The ET tube terminates approximately 10 cm from the carina and must be advanced approximately 3-cm. The heart size is normal. There has been interval improvement of the pulmonary vascular engorgement and mild bilateral pulmonary edema. There has been an interval increase in bibasilar atelectasis. Again seen is the opacity in the medial aspect of the right apical chest, unchanged from the prior exam, for which a CT is recommended for further evaluation. No new focal consolidations, pleural effusions, or pneumothoraces are identified. The hilar and mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.
