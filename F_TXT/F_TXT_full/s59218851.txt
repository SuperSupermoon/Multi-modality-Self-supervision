Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the upper SVC. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinal contours appear unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature does not appear engorged. Hazy opacities within the lungs likely reflect small to moderate size layering bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present. No subdiaphragmatic free air is present. Multiple clips are noted in the mid and left upper abdomen as well as within the left neck. An inferior vena cava filter is also partially imaged.
