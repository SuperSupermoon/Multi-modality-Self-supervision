In comparison to the chest radiographs obtained 1 day prior, there is increased, now mild, pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Increased right lower lung opacities are likely a combination of pneumonia and dependent pulmonary edema. A right-sided pigtail catheter projects over the right dome of the diaphragm. No other focal consolidations are identified. No pneumothorax. The right-sided PICC terminates at the expected location of the superior cavoatrial junction. Median sternotomy wires are midline and intact. Single chamber cardiac pacemaker lead is unchanged in appearance.
