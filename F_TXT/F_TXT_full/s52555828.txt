Comparison is made with prior study performed eight hours earlier. Left lower lobe opacity is new consistent with atelectasis and small effusion. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard position. Tip is 6 cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
