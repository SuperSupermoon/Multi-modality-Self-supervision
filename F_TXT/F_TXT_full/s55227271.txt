The tip of a right PICC line projects over the mid SVC. The tip of a left pectoral power port projects over to the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. An irregularly-shaped opacity at the right lung base corresponds to a focal consolidation identified on recent CT abdomen/ pelvis, and may be due to atelectasis, infection or aspiration. Cardiomegaly with left atrial enlargement is unchanged. Two old healed left rib fractures are incidentally noted.
