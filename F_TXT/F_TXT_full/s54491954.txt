As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Normal lung volumes. Retrocardiac atelectasis. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small left pleural effusion. Normal structure and transparency of the lungs is otherwise noted. No new focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. The course of the nasogastric tube is unchanged, the tip is not directly visualized on the image. The position of the endotracheal tube is constant.
