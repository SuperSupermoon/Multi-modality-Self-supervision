AP upright radiograph through the chest demonstrates intact median sternotomy wires. Surgical clips project over the left upper mediastinal border. An enteric tube descends in the thorax in a uncomplicated course, its tip which projects over the left upper quadrant in the presumed location of the gastric lumen. Heart size is normal. Hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. No opacity convincing for pneumonia is present. Streaky opacity at the left lung base is most consistent with atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
