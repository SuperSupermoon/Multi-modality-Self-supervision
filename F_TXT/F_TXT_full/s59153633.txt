As compared to the previous image, the largest part of the right pleural effusion has been drained. There is now evidence of apicolateral pleural air, creating a 1-2 cm right apical lateral pneumothorax. The position of the right chest tube is constant. Also constant is the position of the left-sided chest tube. The left lung has increased in volume, likely reflecting improved ventilation. This is supported but the decreased extent of the retrocardiac atelectasis. The position of the left PICC line is unchanged.
