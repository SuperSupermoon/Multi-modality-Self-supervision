An opacity in the right upper lobe adjacent to the right paratracheal stripe is likely artifact, given the normal appearance of the right paratracheal stripe and oblique positioning of the patient. There is no effusion, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. There is persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with mild associated atelectasis. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Heart size is normal.
