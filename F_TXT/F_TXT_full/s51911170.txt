Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of bronchovascular markings. Mild interstitial edema is noted. Heart size is poorly evaluated within the setting of low lung volumes and appears accentuated partly by low lung volumes and partly by portable AP chest radiograph technique. Trace left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No focal consolidation.
