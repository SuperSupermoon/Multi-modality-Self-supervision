Tip of the new intra-aortic: Pump projects just above the upper margin of the left main bronchus in standard placement, approximately 4 cm below the apex of the aortic knob. Mild pulmonary edema is new. Right perihilar consolidation could be asymmetric edema, particularly if the patient has mitral regurgitation, or concurrent pneumonia due to aspiration. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are small if any. Heart size normal unchanged. Thoracic aorta is extremely heavily calcified but not focally dilated.
