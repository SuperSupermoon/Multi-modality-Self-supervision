Lung volumes remain very low, causing bronchovascular crowding and apparent enlargement of the probably normal sized heart. Substantial left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged. No new focal opacity. A moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are unchanged. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema. A tracheostomy tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina. A right IJ hemodialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium. An additional right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid to lower SVC. An enteric tube tube passes below the GE junction and outside the field of view. Incidental note is made of cervical fusion hardware.
