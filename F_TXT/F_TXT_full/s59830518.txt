As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of a right pleural pigtail catheter, a right subclavian line, an endotracheal tube and a nasogastric tube. No additional chest tube is visualized. The lung volumes are unchanged, with bilateral pleural effusions, some of which appear intrafissural and loculated. Moderate cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload. No evidence of pneumonia.
