As compared to the previous image, there has been intentional selective intubation of the left main bronchus, as indicated on the referring note. The endotracheal tube is located 1 cm within the orifice of the left main bronchus. The hemodialysis catheter that pre-existed is in unchanged position. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral atelectasis. Signs indicative of moderate pulmonary edema have increased since the previous examination. There could be a minimal left pleural effusion, as reflected by a small blunting of the left costophrenic sinus. No pneumothorax.
