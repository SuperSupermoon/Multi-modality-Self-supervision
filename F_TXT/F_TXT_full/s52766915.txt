Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 4.5 cm above the carina. There are bilateral central lines with distal lead tips at the cavoatrial junction and distal SVC. The heart size is enlarged but stable. There is again seen a persistent pulmonary edema. There is a left retrocardiac opacity which may be due to atelectasis. No large pleural effusions are seen and there are no pneumothoraces.
