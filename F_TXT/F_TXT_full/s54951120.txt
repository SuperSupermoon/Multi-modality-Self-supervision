A right PICC is in the mid SVC at the level of the carina, slightly retracted since the prior study. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lung is noted. There is severe dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. A rounded calcified structure in the left upper abdomen likely represents the calcified splenic artery aneurysm seen on the prior chest CT.
