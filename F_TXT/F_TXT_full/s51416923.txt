1. Interval placement of endotracheal tube which has its tip in the proximal right mainstem bronchus. Re-positioning was recommended, and a wet reading was provided to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on ___ at 10:19 p.m. There is also a nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There has been interval placement of a right basilar pigtail catheter with decrease in size of a right layering pleural effusion. Lung volumes are low with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. Streaky linear opacities in the right base and right mid lung likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. No large pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable, although the cardiac contour is somewhat obscured due to the low lung volumes. No large pneumothorax.
