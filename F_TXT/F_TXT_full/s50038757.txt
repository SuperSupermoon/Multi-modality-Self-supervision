Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___. Substantial left scapular, rib and clavicular fracture is re-demonstrated. Subcutaneous air is large and unchanged since the prior study. Left chest tube is in place. Left basal consolidation is unchanged and there is slight interval development of right basal opacity that might reflect atelectasis, but infectious process is a possibility. Also, there is a new right apical pneumothorax, not seen on the prior study, reason unclear.
