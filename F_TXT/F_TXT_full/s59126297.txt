The right pleural effusion is decreased in size status post thoracentesis with residual small amount of pleural fluid still obscuring the right hemidiaphragm. There is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax. Opacification at the right lung apex and volume loss in the right hemithorax is unchanged and represents stable postoperative appearance. The left lung is relatively clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
