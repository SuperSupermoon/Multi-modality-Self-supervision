1. Right internal jugular central line unchanged in position. A left-sided pacemaker unchanged. The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable. There is persistent retrocardiac consolidation and a layering effusion. The airspace consolidation most likely represents partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. Streaky opacities at the right base likely reflect patchy atelectasis, although aspiration should also be considered. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
