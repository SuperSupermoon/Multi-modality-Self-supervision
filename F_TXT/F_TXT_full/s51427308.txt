AP chest compared to ___ and ___, 2:57 p.m.: Tip of the new Dobbhoff feeding tube, with a wire stylet in place, ends in the mid-to-low stomach. Right internal jugular sheath ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins and the right supraclavicular dialysis catheter orifices are in the right atrium. A small-to-moderate right and moderate left pleural effusion are slightly larger than earlier in the day. Left perihilar consolidation, probably atelectasis, is unchanged. There is probably no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Moderate postoperative widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, which progressed after tracheal extubation is stable since earlier in the day, but should be followed to exclude mediastinal bleeding.
