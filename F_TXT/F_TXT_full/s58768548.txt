1. Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip unchanged and in the right pulmonary outflow tract. Endotracheal tube with tip at the thoracic inlet and nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There are small layering bilateral effusions with associated patchy opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours in this postoperative patient status post median sternotomy for CABG. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
