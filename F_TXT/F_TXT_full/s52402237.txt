An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position approximately 5.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field-of-view. Fluffy central perihilar infiltrates are most consistent with mild pulmonary edema, slightly more prominent on the right than left. There is no focal airspace consolidation. There is no definite pleural effuion or pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours appear slightly widened, possibly due to position. The heart size is mildly enlarged.
