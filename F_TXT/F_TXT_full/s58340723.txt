Compared to the prior study and allowing for technical differences, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is mild cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires and left-sided pacemaker, lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle. No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is identified. The mediastinum remains midline.
