In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been substantial opacification of the left hemithorax, consistent with collapse of a portion of or a substantial amount of the left lung. In the area of lucency adjacent to the aortic arch raises the possibility that this could represent collapse of the left upper lobe with the lucency representing air in the residual portion of the left lower lobe. Otherwise, little change. This was discussed with the resident by the Radiology resident on call.
