As compared to the previous image, the previous left-sided chest tube was replaced by a left pigtail catheter. The chest wall, the lung bases and the retrocardiac lung areas have not substantially changed. The left lung apex is now better ventilated than previously. No change in appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the right lung.
