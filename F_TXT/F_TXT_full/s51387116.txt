Chest radiograph evaluation, particularly the left heart border, is limited due to patient rotation . Within this limitation, there appears to be an opacity projecting over the left heart border, possibly representing lingular pneumonia. Coarsened interstial markings evident in the lung bases, may reflect differences in technique. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion evident. The patient is status post CABG with stable cardiac enlargement. Mediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable. Significant thoracolumbar scoliosis with associated degenerative changes identified. Deformity of left clavicle likely due to prior trauma.
