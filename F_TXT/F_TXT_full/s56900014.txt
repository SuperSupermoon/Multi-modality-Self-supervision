Interval placement of a right pleural pigtail catheter with decrease in size of the right pleural effusion. Opacities in the right lower lung zone are noted, likely reflect development of pulmonary edema and the patient's underlying lung cancer. Patchy airspace opacities in the left mid to lower lung zone have increased and may reflect a combination of atelectasis and superimposed infection. A small left pleural effusion persists. No pneumothorax identified. The size of the cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
