The presence of extensive subcutaneous emphysema reduces the sensitivity of chest radiography for detecting pneumothoraces. With this limitation in mind, no pneumothorax is identified. Left chest tube has been removed since the prior study, and right chest tube is unchanged in position. Endotracheal tube remains in standard position, but cuff appears slightly overdistended. Heart size is normal. Worsening heterogeneous airspace opacities in right lower lobe are concerning for aspiration or evolving infectious pneumonia. Numerous air-fluid levels are again demonstrated in the left upper lobe lateral to the left hilum, and may reflect hemorrhage or infection within a bullae. An adjacent area of consolidation is present in this region as well. As compared to the recent study of ___, the degree of subcutaneous emphysema has worsened, and is particularly more marked in the neck, axilla and lateral chest wall as compared to the prior studies.
