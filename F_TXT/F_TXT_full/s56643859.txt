Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There is slight prominence of the hila which could be due to fluid overload or may be accentuated by supine position and AP technique. No large pleural effusion is seen, although trace pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude. The cardiac silhouette is likely accentuated by technique. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. No definite focal consolidation. No evidence of pneumothorax. There are non-displaced fractures of the lateral left seventh and eighth ribs of indeterminate age, but may be subacute or old.
