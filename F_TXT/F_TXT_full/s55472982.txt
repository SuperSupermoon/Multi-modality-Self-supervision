Again seen is the pigtail catheter at the left lung base. Also again seen is a small to moderate left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Compared to the prior study, there is slightly less aeration in the retrocardiac region, but the overall appearance is otherwise similar. There is upper zone redistribution, with mild vascular plethora, without other evidence of CHF. There is minimal atelectasis the right lung base and possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged, with sternotomy wires noted. No pneumothorax detected.
