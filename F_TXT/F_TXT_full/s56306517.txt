AP chest compared to ___: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema probably stable, exaggerated by low lung volumes. Small pleural effusions are larger and mediastinal vascular congestion more pronounced probably due to volume administration. Given the limitations of chest radiograph performed in expiration, I can only says there is no pneumonia in the mid and upper lung zones. Lung bases cannot be assessed in that regard. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube appears to have been advanced into the stomach, appropriately. Right internal jugular line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
