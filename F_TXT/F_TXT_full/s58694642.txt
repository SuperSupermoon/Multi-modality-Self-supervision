There is mildly increased aeration of the left upper lung with near complete opacification of the remaining left lung. The left lower lung cannot be well assessed. Increased focal opacity at the right lung base likely represents vascular congestion secondary to volume overload versus redirection of blood flow secondary to large left pleural effusion. A superimposed pneumonia at the right lung base cannot be excluded. A small right pleural effusion is noted. The cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be assessed due to the large left-sided pleural effusion. A large pneumothorax is not present.
