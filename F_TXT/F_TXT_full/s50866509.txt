In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube which extends to the upper body of the stomach. The right IJ catheter has been removed. Continued and possibly increasing opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm. This is consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis. There may be several streaks of atelectasis at the right base as well. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
