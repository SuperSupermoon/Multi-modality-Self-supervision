Low lung volumes are present which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is moderate to severely enlarged. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous. Left-sided dialysis catheter tip terminates at the SVC/right atrial junction. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. No focal consolidation is noted. No pleural effusion is present. Calcification of the right diaphragmatic pleura is re- demonstrated. Calcified left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes and calcified nodule in the left mid lung field are unchanged, compatible with prior granulomatous disease. Clips are again seen in the superior mediastinum, to the left of the trachea.
