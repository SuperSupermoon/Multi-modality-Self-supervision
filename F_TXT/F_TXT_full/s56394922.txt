The patient is status post median sternotomy with double metallic closure devices projecting over the mid chest. Surgical clips project over the mediastinum. There is a prosthetic valve in place. There is chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The aorta is calcified and tortuous, creating appearance of left retrocardiac opacity. However, left retrocardiac opacity seems worse than prior studies, particularly laterally, concerning for possible infection or atelectasis. The remainder of the lung fields are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax within the limitations of this single projection view. A G-tube projects over the left upper quadrant. The heart is not enlarged. Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.
