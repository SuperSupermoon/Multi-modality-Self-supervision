1. There is persistent opacification of the left hemithorax with some residual aeration at the left lower lobe associated with volume loss and mediastinal and cardiac shift to the left. Overall, the appearance does not appear to be significantly changed. The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip 4 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip within the stomach. A portion of an inferior vena caval filter is also visualized at the edge of the film within the abdomen. The right lung is well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion. There is a stable calcified nodule measuring 1.3 cm in the seventh interspace. This most likely represents a calcified granuloma. No acute bony abnormality is appreciated.
