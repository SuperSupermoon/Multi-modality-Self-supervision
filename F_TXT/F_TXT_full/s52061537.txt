The course of a right-sided PICC line is difficult to visualize but it probably terminates, as before, at the cavoatrial junction. The patient is status post sternotomy and probably coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Hazy opacification of each lung is consistent with pulmonary edema, probably somewhat worse than on the prior study, although increased blurring may be due to differences in technique to some extent. In particular, in the left mid lung, there is a more conspicuous opacity, but this may be due to rotation compared to the prior study. Pleural effusions are difficult to exclude. There is no pneumothorax.
