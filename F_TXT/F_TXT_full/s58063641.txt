After thoracoscopy, there has been significant interval decrease in the size of a large left pleural effusion. Mild amount of fluid persists within the left costophrenic angle and a linear opacity within the left mid lung likely reflects plate-like atelectasis. There is a small apical pneumothorax. There is also left basilar atelectasis. Unfolding and tortuosity of the aorta seen on prior radiographs appears similar. Cardiac margins are obscured by basilar opacity. Left chest tube terminates in the medial left upper lung adjacent to the aortic knob on the frontal view.
