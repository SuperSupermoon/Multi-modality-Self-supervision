Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. The study is somewhat limited due to patient's body habitus. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Intrathoracic aorta is tortuous. Heart is mildly enlarged, unchanged. Linear opacity in the left lung base is longstanding and likely represents an area of scarring. There is mild pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities are noted, which may reflect atelectasis. A fixation hardware overlying of the right humerus is noted.
