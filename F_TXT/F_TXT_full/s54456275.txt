AP chest compared to ___ preoperative chest radiograph: Right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax, mediastinal widening, or pleural effusion. Engorgement of mediastinal veins is readily explained by supine positioning. In the setting of lower lung volumes, irregular opacification in the left mid and right lower lung zone are probably due to atelectasis. Top normal heart size is unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema, appreciable pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
