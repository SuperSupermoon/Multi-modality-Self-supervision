Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is prominence of the perihilar vascular structures and interstitium consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. Hilar are mildly prominent. The costophrenic angles are not well seen due to patient's overlying soft tissues and underpenetration, although small pleural effusions cannot be excluded. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified.
