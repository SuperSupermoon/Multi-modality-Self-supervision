Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube is in standard position. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC. NG tube tip is coiled in the stomach, the tip is at the fundus, unchanged. Cardiomegaly is stable. There is mild vascular congestion. Right upper lobe opacity is likely atelectasis. Bibasilar atelectases have improved.
