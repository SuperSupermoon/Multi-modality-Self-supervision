Single portable view of the chest. No prior. There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature and indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen bilaterally with parenchymal opacities at the lung bases. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a small effusion. Cardiac silhouette is borderline enlarged for technique. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the arch. Osseous and soft tissue structures are grossly unremarkable. Surgical clips noted in the right upper quadrant suggesting prior cholecystectomy.
