Lung volumes are low. Midline sternotomy wires are well aligned. Right sided PICC now terminates in right axilla. The cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vasculature unremarkable. Again noted is right paratracheal soft tissue, consistent with known lymphadenopathy. Diffuse, patchy, right-sided opacity is progressed since the most recent examination. Left basilar opacity is more prominent as well. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
