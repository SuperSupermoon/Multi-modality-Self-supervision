AP view centered at the diaphragm compared to ___ at 3:12 p.m.: Upper enteric drainage tube can be traced only as far as the distal esophagus. Subsequent chest radiograph, 9 a.m., on ___ showed the tube extending just to the diaphragm. It does not show the tip of the tube. I will discuss any need for imaging documentation of tube placement with Dr. ___.
