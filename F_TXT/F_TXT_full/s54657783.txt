As compared to the previous image, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 mm above the carina, the tube needs to be pulled back by approximately 2-3 cm. The Dobbhoff catheter shows an unchanged course, tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach. The two right-sided central venous access lines are constant. Whereas the right lung is unremarkable, bases have developed a relatively extensive basal opacity that might reflect atelectasis or pneumonia, or a combination of both. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant. Minimal left pleural effusion.
