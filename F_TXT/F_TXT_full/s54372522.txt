In comparison with the study of ___, following thoracentesis there has been substantial decrease in the left pleural effusion, though residual fluid is still present and there is obscuration of the hemidiaphragm consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe. No evidence of post procedure pneumothorax. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view. Cardiac silhouette is unchanged and there is mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. There is also evidence of previous cervical fusion procedure.
