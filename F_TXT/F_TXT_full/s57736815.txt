AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 3:05 p.m.: Previous left pneumothorax has resolved since 3:03 p.m. and the insertion of the left apical pleural tube. There is no appreciable left pleural effusion. Small right pleural effusion is stable. Postoperative widening of the upper mediastinum is slightly more pronounced now than earlier in the day or ___, but could be due to adjacent pleural loculation on the left and mediastinal vascular engorgement on the right. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is probably unchanged. Small right pleural effusion and moderate bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema. A right PIC line ends low in the SVC. Sternal wires are intact and alignment is unchanged since the earliest postoperative radiograph on ___. Persistent lucency in the upper and lower sternal segments is not uncommon in this early postoperatively.
