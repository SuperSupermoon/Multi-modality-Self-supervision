Previous dependent consolidation in the right lung has cleared so substantially since ___ that the bulk of it was probably pulmonary edema, although some contribution from aspiration may well have been present. The left lower lobe remains entirely airless, presumably collapsed, though pneumonia is not excluded. The severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is a long-standing finding, exaggerated by a large mediastinal fat collection. Pleural effusion is small on the left if any. Vascular congestion in the upper lungs reflects cardiac dysfunction. Left PIC line ends in the low SVC. Mild narrowing of the trachea at the thoracic inlet is most commonly due to prior tracheostomy.
