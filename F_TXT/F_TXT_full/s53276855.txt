As compared to previous study of 1 day earlier, right pigtail pleural catheter has changed in position, and a moderate sized right pleural effusion has apparently slightly increased in size in the interval and is associated with loculated hydro pneumothorax components at the right lung base. Right hemidiaphragm remains markedly elevated. Within the left hemi thorax, small left pleural effusion has increased in size, and left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened. Please see recently performed CT of the chest for more complete assessment of these findings.
