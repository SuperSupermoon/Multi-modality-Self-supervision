AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. The supporting tubes and lines have been removed with currently only the right internal jugular line being present with its tip terminating in the superior SVC. Replaced aortic valve is in the expected location. Heart size and mediastinum appears to be grossly unchanged and the patient is currently in pulmonary edema with large bilateral associated pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is substantially larger than on the prior study and might potentially reflect the portable nature of the study, but pericardial effusion is a possibility and close followup is required.
