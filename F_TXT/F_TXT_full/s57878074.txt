Left-sided chest tube remains in place, with a moderate-sized left pneumothorax with apical lateral and basilar components. As compared to the prior study, the overall size of the pneumothorax is similar, but there has been increasing amount of pleural fluid at the left base. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Multifocal areas of atelectasis are again demonstrated, with slight improvement at both bases.
