Again seen is an NG tube, extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film. Also again seen is a left subclavian PICC line, with tip near the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax detected. Inspiratory volumes are lower and the patient is more kyphotic than on the prior study. Cardiac contours are obscured by surrounding pleural fluid and consolidation. As before, the aortic arch is appears expanded and calcified, similar in configuration. The trachea is deviated to the right. Aneurysmal areas of the aorta were better demonstrated aneurysmal portions of the order were better demonstrated on a CT from ___. Again seen is a moderate size left pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. New compared with the prior study, there is a moderate right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is upper zone redistribution mild vascular plethora, probably increased slightly. The upper portion of fusion hardware in the lumbar spine is noted. A left breast prosthesis is again noted.
