As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support devices, with exception of the right internal jugular vein introduction sheath, have been removed. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The signs indicative of mild pulmonary edema have decreased in severity. Atelectasis persists in both perihilar areas and at both lung bases. Also persisting is a small left pleural effusion. No newly occurred parenchymal changes.
