The patient remains intubated. Positioning of the endotracheal tube appears unchanged. A right-sided PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava. There is again a very large hiatal hernia hernia in which the orogastric tube again terminates. There is similarly a mildly distended viscus within the hernia sac; a portion of the transverse colon is suspected to reside with in the hernia in addition to a substantial portion of the stomach. There is a suspected small layering pleural effusion on the right with patchy right basilar opacity that is compatible with atelectasis. The pleural effusion appears less prominent, however, but the apparent difference is possibly due to differences in patient orientation. A pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on the left. A left upper lobe opacity has shifted somewhat and appears more flat and dense, layering along the left hemidiaphragm, perhaps more suggestive of atelectasis than pneumonia on this examination. In addition, a retrocardiac opacity opacity also persists in the left lower lobe. There is no pneumothorax.
