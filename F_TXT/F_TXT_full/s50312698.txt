As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been slightly pulled back, it should be pulled forward, as the tip of the tube now projects almost 6 cm above the carina. Advancement of the tube by approximately 2 cm is recommended. The Dobbhoff catheter and the second feeding tube show unchanged position. The overinflation of the stomach has decreased in the interval. However, there is a slight increase in severity of the opacity seen at the right lung base, consistent with aspiration. The left basal opacities are constant in appearance. No pneumothorax.
