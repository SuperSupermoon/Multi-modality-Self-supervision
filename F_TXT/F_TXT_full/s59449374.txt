ET tube tip lies approximately 5.4 cm above the carina. There are low inspiratory volumes, with mild prominence the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is minimal atelectasis at the right base medially. No gross effusion, though small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. Mild vascular plethora, without other evidence of CHF. This appearance is also likely accentuated by low lung volumes. No pneumothorax is detected. Skin ___ noted.
