Support and monitoring devices are in standard position. Postoperative changes from left upper lobe resection are again demonstrated, with homogeneous opacity occupying left upper hemi thorax, more fully evaluated by a recent CTA. Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema are similar. Small to moderate left pleural effusion has slightly worsened, with accompanying increased atelectasis and or consolidation at left lung base.
