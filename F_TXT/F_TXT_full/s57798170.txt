Tip of nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach, but side port is not well visualized and could potentially be above the GE junction level. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are accentuated by patient rotation, low lung volumes and supine portable technique. These factors also accentuate the pulmonary vascularity, limiting assessment of the cardiovascular status of the patient. No gross areas of consolidation are evident within the lungs on this limited study, and there is no evidence of a pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube is in standard position.
