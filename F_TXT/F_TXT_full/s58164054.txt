A newly positioned Dobbhoff tube ends into the fundus/body of the stomach. An orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, its distal end is off the radiographic view. Right-sided PICC line tip is at mid SVC and tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Bilateral lungs are diffusely hazy with obscuration of bronchovascular markings, suggestive of mild pulmonary edema, is little more sever since ___. The upper left mediastinal shadow at the aortic arch is more prominent with lateral bulge than it was on ___. If this reflects engorged mediastinal vessels or acute aortic pathology, cannot be determined on this supine view alone. Pleural effusions, if any, are minimal bilaterally. Top-Normal heart size is unchanged, aorta is generally tortuous, and the mediastinal and hilar contours have a stable appearance. IMPRESSION; In order to differentiate recent widening of left upper mediastinum due to engorged mediastinal vessels which appears reasonable as reflected by interval worsening mild pulmonary edema vs acute aortic pathology, erect view is recommended for further evaluation.
