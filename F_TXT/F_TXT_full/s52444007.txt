Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and globular in appearance, raising concern for pericardial effusion. There is a small left pleural effusion. A trace right pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. There is no overt pulmonary edema. Aortic knob calcification is seen.
