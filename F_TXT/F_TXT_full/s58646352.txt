A right-sided chest tube is in satisfactory position and directed superiorly. Subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest wall has improved. The lung volumes are low. The patient is status post resection of the right lower lobe. Increased consolidation of the right lung base is though to reflect atelectasis and right middle lobe collapse. There is no evidence for torsion at this time. A new, small right pleural effusion is noted. There is no pneumothorax. Minimal atelectasis is seen at the left lung base. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. The tortuous aorta is again seen.
