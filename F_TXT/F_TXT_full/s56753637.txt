In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued hazy opacifications at the bases consistent with layering effusions. Retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. The PICC line extends to the lower portion of the SVC. Some engorgement of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
