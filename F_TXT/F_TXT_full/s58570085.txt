In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the opacification at the right base, consistent with pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis. The pulmonary vessels remain engorged, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Smaller left effusion with atelectasis is seen. Central catheter tip extends to the cavoatrial junction or, more likely, the upper portion of the right atrium.
