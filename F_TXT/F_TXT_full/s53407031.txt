The endotracheal tube terminates 3.7 cm above the carina in appropriate position. A right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. There are unchanged bilateral, right greater than left pleural effusions as well as mild pulmonary edema. Volume loss in the left lung base could be due to atelectasis, and likely accentuated by severe scoliosis and oblique positioning of the patient. The cardiac silhouette is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
