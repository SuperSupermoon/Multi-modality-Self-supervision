The patient has been intubated. Although it is difficult to measure the precise distance, the endotracheal tube closely approaches the carina and retracting the tube by approximately 2 cm is suggested. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach. There is better aeration at the right lung base. The pulmonary vascularity is again mildly prominent. It is difficult to exclude retrocardiac opacity noting slight blurring of the margins of the left hemidiaphragm, but this appearance may be due to difficulty in interpretation due to overlying soft tissue attenuation. The heart remains mildly enlarged.
