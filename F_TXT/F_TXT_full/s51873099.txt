A right Port-A-Cath ends in the low SVC. Lung volumes are slightly low. There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis. Mild cardiomegaly is not significantly changed. The descending thoracic aorta is slightly tortuous, as before. A small left pleural effusion is not excluded. There is no right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. A linear lucency along the left heart border could be due to minimal pneumomediastinum or a medial left pneumothorax, not unexpected status post mediastinoscopy. S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is re-demonstrated.
