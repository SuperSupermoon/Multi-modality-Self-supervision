There is near-complete of opacification of left hemithorax, worsened since prior chest radiograph from ___ at 07:05 and likely related to a large left-sided pleural effusion as seen on outside chest CT. However, evaluation of underlying pleural thickening for underlying lesion is limited in this examination. There is rightward shift of the cardiomediastinal structures. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle could also reflect a small pleural effusion, new since the radiograph from earlier today. There is atelectasis at the right lung base. No large pneumothorax identified on this portable chest radiograph.
