As compared to the previous radiograph, the very extensive parenchymal opacities on the right are not substantially changed. On the left, pre-existing opacities have minimally decreased in extent and severity. No new opacities are seen. The lung volumes remain low. There is no evidence of pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No pneumothorax.
