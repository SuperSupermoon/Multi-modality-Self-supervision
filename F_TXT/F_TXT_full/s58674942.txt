Cardiomegaly is substantial but appears to be minimally improved since the previous study although it might reflect differences in the positioning of the patient. Pulmonary arteries are enlarged. No evidence of pulmonary edema is present. No pneumothorax is seen. Pacemaker defibrillator leads are most likely terminating in right atrium and right ventricle, partially imaged.
