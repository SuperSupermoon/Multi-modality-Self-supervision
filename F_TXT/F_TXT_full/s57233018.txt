In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing opacification at the right base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm and meniscus formation, consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the lower lung. Less prominent retrocardiac opacification with blunting of the left costophrenic angle, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small pleural effusion. Central catheter remains in position in this patient with intact midline sternal wires following CABG procedure.
