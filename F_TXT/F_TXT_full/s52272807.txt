As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a massive bilateral very diffuse pattern of parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms, without substantial interstitial component and without the presence of pleural effusions. Moderate cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax. The symmetry of the changes as well as their rather centralized predominance would favor acute pulmonary edema. On the other hand, the absence of an interstitial component would be more typical in infection.
