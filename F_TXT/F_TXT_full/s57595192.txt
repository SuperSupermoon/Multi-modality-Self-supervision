Single portable chest radiograph is provided. Endotracheal tube terminates in the mid trachea, approximately 3.1 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach. An ovoid density projects over the right upper lobe, likely external to the patient. Irregular opacities in the lolwer lobe, more prominent since the prior radiograph are most consistent with aspiration. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There are no displaced fractures.
