The patient is rotated which limits assessment. Heart size is likely mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the degree of rotation. There is no pulmonary edema. Lung volumes are low, and streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation is clearly evident. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
