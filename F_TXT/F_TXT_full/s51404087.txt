Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There are low lung volumes. Elevation of the left lower lobe has improved. Atelectasis in the right lower lobe is grossly unchanged. Right perihilar and upper lobe opacities have increased. This could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. If any, there are small effusions. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
