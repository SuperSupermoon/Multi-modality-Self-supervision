AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. During the interval, the patient has been extubated. No pneumothorax has developed. Rather high-positioned diaphragms indicate poor inspirational effort and this conceals some major portion of the cardiac silhouette. However, there is no suspicion for significant cardiac enlargement as the pulmonary vasculature is not congested. No new acute infiltrates can be identified. The lateral pleural sinuses remain free. Skeletal structures of the imaged thorax are grossly unremarkable. If suspicion for specific skeletal injuries exists it is recommended to request dedicated rib examination, thoracic spine or shoulders etc.
