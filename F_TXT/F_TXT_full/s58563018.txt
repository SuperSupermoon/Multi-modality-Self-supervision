New ET tube ends 2.5 cm above the carina. Right moderate pleural effusion with passive atelectasis is unchanged. There is new collapse of the left lower lung. There is no pneumothorax. Increase in density of all the bones could raise the possibility of diffuse metastatic prostate cancer or renal insufficiency. CONCLUSION 1. New ET tube is in adequate position. 2. New left lower lung collapse. 3. Unchanged diffuse increased density of the bones. The differential diagnostic is broad, but includes more frequently metastatic prostate cancer in male patients and renal osteodystrophy. Less frequently, it could be from hematologic or other rare metabolic disorders.
