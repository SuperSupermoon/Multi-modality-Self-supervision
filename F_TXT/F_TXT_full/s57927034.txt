Mild to moderate interstitial edema is developed throughout both lungs. More pronounced opacification in the right mid an lung lower lung zones could represent either asymmetric edema or the development of concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. Borderline cardiomegaly has increased since ___. Interim endotracheal extubation, may have contributed to the current picture because the termination of positive pressure ventilation may encourage edema, and extubation may have permitted aspiration. Left subclavian line ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial.
