Comparison is made to the prior study performed earlier. The nasogastric tube has been advanced and the tip and side port are below the GE junction. The right-sided central venous catheter has the distal lead tip in the proximal SVC and could be advanced 6-7 cm for more optimal placement. There is unchanged cardiomegaly and a left retrocardiac opacity. There is also atelectasis at both lung bases, right side worse than left. No pneumothoraces are identified.
