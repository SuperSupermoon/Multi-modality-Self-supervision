AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Opacification in the right lower hemithorax has improved a little. I am uncertain whether this is due to posteriorly layering pleural effusion or an intrinsic abnormality in the right lower lobe, which could be aspiration or even asymmetric edema if the patient lies in the right side down position. Patient has had median sternotomy. Heart is normal size. Left lung is grossly clear and there is no left pleural abnormality. ET tube in standard placement. Right PIC line ends centrally, and the nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of a non-distended stomach. No pneumothorax.
