Frontal portable views of the chest were obtained. A new moderate-sized left pneumothorax is present without evidence of tension. Generalized increased opacity of the left lung, greater than expected for the degree of volume loss, may represent lavage fluid, although post-procedural hemorrhage is not excluded. A large left hilar mass is similar in size to ___, allowing for differences in modality. Linear opacities at the right lung base are compatible with atelectasis. No pleural effusion is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No radiopaque foreign body.
