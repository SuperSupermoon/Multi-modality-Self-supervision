As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received an orogastric tube. The tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach and is correctly located. An endotracheal tube and the right central venous access line are unchanged as compared to the previous examination. A certain amount of pleural fluid on the right, pre-existing on the previous image, is now located in the apical regions of the lung. However, the overall extent of the effusions on the left than on the right has not substantially changed. Retrocardiac atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax.
