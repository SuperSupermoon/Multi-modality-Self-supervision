Single portable view of the chest. Exam is slightly limited secondary to positioning with patient's chin and face overlying the lung apices. That said, lungs are grossly clear. There is no large effusion, consolidation or pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormality is identified. Rounded calcific density projecting just medial to the left glenoid may represent an intra-articular body.
