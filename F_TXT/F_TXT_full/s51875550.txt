Portable chest radiograph demonstrates persistent severe known pneumoperitoneum. There is unchanged appearing bilateral atelectasis of the lower lobes with small bilateral pleural effusions. There is decreased aeration of the left lower lobe which may represent worsening atelectasis versus infectious pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. There are no findings to suggest vascular congestion on this radiograph. There has been interval removal of a right-sided internal jugular catheter. No pneumothorax. There is a left sided PICC seen terminating at the mid to low SVC in constant position.
