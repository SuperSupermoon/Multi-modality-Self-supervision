Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. Moderate pulmonary edema may have worsened, superimposed on chronic interstitial lung disease, although lower lung volumes may be be responsible for the apparent change. Perhaps positive pressure ventilator support has been decreased. This would explain worsening of severe left lower lobe consolidation due to progressive atelectasis, but it also looks like there has been an increase in moderate left pleural effusion. Heart size is obscured. Lines and tubes in standard placements. No pneumothorax.
