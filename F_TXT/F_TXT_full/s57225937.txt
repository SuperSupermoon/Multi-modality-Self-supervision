A newly placed endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles. A new OG tube coils in the larynx but enters a large hiatal hernia. A right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the low SVC. Lung volumes are low. Left basilar airspace opacities are most likely due to atelectasis adjacent to the hiatal hernia. The followup radiograph performed shortly thereafter shows further advancement of the OG tube into the intrathoracic stomach.
