As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The appearance of the endotracheal tube, the two nasogastric tubes, the single and the double-lumen catheter inserted over the right internal jugular vein are constant. The predominantly right basal atelectatic opacities have decreased in extent. On today's image, only a single plate-like atelectasis is seen. There is extensive air collection in the bilateral soft tissues. No evidence of pneumothorax. Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
