Since the prior exam, there is a new interstitial opacity, predominantly involving the right, mid and lower lung zones. There is mild vascular congestion and some Kerley B lines at the left base, suggestive of volume overload. A small right pleural effusion is stable in size. A trace left pleural effusion appears slightly decreased in size. There is no pneumothorax. Biapical scarring is stable. The mediastinal contours are normal. The heart size is mildly enlarged, and unchanged. The patient is status post a sternotomy. Sternal wires are intact. Again noted is a displaced overriding right humerus fracture, not significantly changed from prior exams.
