ET tube terminates approximately 6.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube tip overlies the gastric fundus. The heart is not enlarged. There is mild-to-moderate bilateral perihilar vascular congestion. Diffuse heterogeneous opacities throughout the lungs bilaterally -- in the appropriate clinical setting, this are likely secondary to interstitial edema. Retrocardiac air bronchograms are consistent with either alveolar edema or collpase and/or conslidation. There is no large pleural effusion. No obvious pneumothorax, though extreme upper lung apices are excluded from the film.
