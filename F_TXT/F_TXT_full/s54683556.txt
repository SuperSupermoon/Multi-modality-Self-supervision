The ETT is in standard position. An enteric tube traverses the midline and its side port is in the stomach. A left internal jugular venous catheter likely ends in the mid upper SVC with its tip pointing cephalad, similar to the prior exams. Lung volumes remain low, but are slightly improved from the previous exam. Bilateral small pleural effusions are perhaps slightly improved. Atelectasis in left lung is moderate and overall unchanged. Right lung atelectasis is improved. No pneumothorax. The heart is mildly enlarged, perhaps slightly decreased in size from the prior exam. Overall no change pulmonary vascular congestion when accounting for differences in redistribution but no frank pulmonary edema.
