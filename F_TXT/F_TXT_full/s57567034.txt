Lower half of the chest has not been included on this radiograph. Again visualized is a large right pleural effusion with underlying right lower and middle lobe atelectasis. Swan-Ganz catheter is in appropriate position. Intra aortic balloon pump remains less than 1 cm from the apex of the aortic arch and should be slightly retracted. Small left pleural effusion persists. No interval change in bony thorax.
