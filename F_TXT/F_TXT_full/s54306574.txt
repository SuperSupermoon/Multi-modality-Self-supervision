Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There has been interval improvement in lung volumes with no evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pleural effusions, or pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Hiatal hernia again seen. If pulmonary embolism is of clinical concern, further imaging with chest CT would be advised. No acute bony abnormality appreciated.
