A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. The lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is similar heterogeneous opacification of each lung, greater on the right than left, with indistinct pulmonary vasculature suggesting mild to moderate pulmonary edema the main difference is an increasing pleural effusion on the right with right basilar volume loss suggesting coinciding atelectasis. A small pleural effusion is noted on the left.
