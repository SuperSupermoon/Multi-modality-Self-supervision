There is a new large-bore catheter in the right internal jugular position. Combination of findings raises serious concern about active extravasation or bleeding. These findings and the need to assess the location and function of the multichannel catheter were discussed by telephone with ___, who was paged 1 minute after the findings were recognized and responded within 60 seconds. Lung volumes are appreciably lower and there is a possibility of a very mild pulmonary edema. Heart size is normal. Thoracic aorta is generally large and tortuous but unchanged and not focally dilated. ET tube is in standard placement. Sharp definition of the upper margin of the cuff indicates pooling secretions above it. Enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
