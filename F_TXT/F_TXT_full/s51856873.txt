Right sided Port-A-Cath unchanged in position. Lung volumes are lower with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. Bilateral increasing effusions with associated persisting consolidation in the left lower lobe and more patchy opacity at the right base favoring atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning and inspiration between studies.
