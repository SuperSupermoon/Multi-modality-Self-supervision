There is a central venous catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction, inserted via a right subclavian approach. The heart is mild-to-moderately enlarged with a globular configuration. The aortic arch is calcified. The aortopulmonary window is slightly prominent suggesting possible enlargement of the main pulmonary artery. Central pulmonary arteries are also mildly enlarged. There is an asymmetric left paramedian opacity with upward tenting, perhaps a form of scarring. Bilateral perihilar fullness suggests mild superimposed pulmonary congestion, however. A moderate left-sided pleural effusion is also noted. Associated parenchymal opacity is suspected, probably attributable to associated atelectasis, although infectious etiology is not entirely excluded.
