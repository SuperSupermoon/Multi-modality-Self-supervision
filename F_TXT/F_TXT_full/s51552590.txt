Tracheostomy is in place. Substantial amount of subcutaneous air within the neck is noted. Left subclavian line tip terminates at the left brachycephalic vein before crossing the mid line. Left chest tube is inserted but the side hole is at the level of the ribs and she the tube should be further advanced. Left basal consolidation and atelectasis are potentially slightly improved as compared to previous CT torso and a scout view of the CT torso. Pneumothorax is not clearly visible although minimal amount cannot be excluded. Right lung is essentially clear.
