An endotracheal tube terminates within the proximal right mainstem bronchus. Enteric tube tip and side-port are within the stomach. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Opacity within the left lung base may reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or aspiration. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures due to low lung volumes. Peribronchial cuffing suggests airway inflammation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.
