Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent mild bilateral interstitial opacities consistent with pulmonary edema, which has not significantly changed from the prior study. The mediastinum remains enlarged with prominence of the main pulmonary artery. There are stable-appearing moderate bibasilar pleural effusions. There is stable-appearing severe cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax.
