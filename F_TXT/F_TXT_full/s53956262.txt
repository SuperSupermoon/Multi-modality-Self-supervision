1. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. The lungs are relatively hyperinflated with areas of increased lucency, particularly in the left upper lung. These findings are consistent with underlying emphysema. Chain sutures are seen at the right apex consistent with previous thoracic surgery. A single clip is also seen projecting within the fifth right interspace. Streaky linear opacities in the right mid and left lower lobe likely reflect scarring or subsegmental atelectasis. No focal airspace consolidations is seen to suggest pneumonia. There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax.
