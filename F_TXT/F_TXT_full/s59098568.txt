A tracheostomy tube terminates 3.7 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are slightly diminished, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Opacity at the left lung base could reflect pneumonia or atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart is normal size. The appearance of the mediastinum is stable, with unfolded aorta. An old healed right clavicular fracture is noted.
