Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. There is persistent increased opacification at the right lung base consistent with aspiration and atelectasis. There is persistent engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature without frank pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Endotracheal tube ends 4.4 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. The left-sided wide bore internal jugular central venous line ends at the left bracheocephalic vein. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation.
