Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There has been interval worsening of opacity in the left lower hemithorax. This is a combination of small effusion and adjacent consolidation. This consolidation could be worsening large area of atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. The right base small effusion has minimally increased. Adjacent opacities could be atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Severe cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous.
