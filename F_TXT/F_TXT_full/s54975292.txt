Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided. The chest tube projects over the right lateral hemithorax with lateralizing right pleural effusion again seen. There is right perihilar opacity which appears similar to the prior exam allowing for slight changes in patient positioning. The left lung is mostly clear, though there may be mild atelectasis at the left lung base. The heart size is unchanged. Bony structures are intact.
