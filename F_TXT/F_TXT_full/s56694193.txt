The right IJ line is been removed. There bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right. There is dense retrocardiac opacification that could be due to volume loss/ infiltrate/effusion. There is also hazy alveolar infiltrate in the right lower lung likely secondary to effusion layering posteriorly and some volume loss.
