Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with the heart size within normal limits. Lung volumes are low with crowding of bronchovascular structures and possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Patchy right basilar opacity likely reflects an area of atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Please note that the extreme lung apices are somewhat obscured by the patient's neck and chin obscuring this region. No acute osseous abnormality is demonstrated.
