Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiac size is top normal, the aorta is tortuous, there are low lung volumes. Biapical opacities have increased consistent with a worsening pneumonia. Bibasilar opacities larger on the left side have worsened consistent with worsening atelectasis, there is no pneumothorax. There is no evidence of large amount of free air under the diaphragm, this evaluation is limited due to the projection. The stomach is very distended. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm, right central catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
