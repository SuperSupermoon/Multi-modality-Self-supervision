1. Right Pleurx catheter again is seen at the base with the tip located inferomedially. The right subpulmonic pneumothorax is unchanged if not slightly smaller. There is a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema laterally on the right. Overall, the right mid and lower lung opacity is stable, part of which represents a known lung mass. There is a stable right apical and lateral pleural thickening which could reflect pleural fluid, chronic pleural thickening and/or pleural metastasis. Left lung remains grossly clear but hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema. The aorta is calcified consistent with atherosclerosis. Overall, heart is unchanged in size. Degenerative changes of the right acromioclavicular and right glenohumeral joint. No acute bony abnormality appreciated.
