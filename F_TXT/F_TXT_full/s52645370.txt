AP chest compared to ___: Endotracheal tube is in standard placement. I cannot assess the condition of the airway above the cuff on the endotracheal tube. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach. Heart size normal. Heterogeneous opacification in the right lower lobe could be aspiration, since it is more pronounced now than on the earlier study. Healed right posterior rib fractures are noted.
