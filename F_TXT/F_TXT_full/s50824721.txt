In addition to a Port-A-Cath that terminates in the upper right atrium, a new right internal central venous catheter has been placed, which terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. In addition to a band-like opacity suggesting minor atelectasis in the left mid lung, there is a new mild fullness of central pulmonary vessels which suggests mild fluid overload.
