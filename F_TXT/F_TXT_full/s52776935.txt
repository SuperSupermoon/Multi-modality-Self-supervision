Portable apparently supine chest radiograph is submitted with regular and edge enhancement technique. A temporary transvenous pacing line is seen extending over the expected course of the right internal jugular vein down across the right side of the heart with the tip at the expected level of the right ventricle. Other radiodense lines in the view of the film appear to be outside the patient. Compared to prior study from one day earlier, both hemidiaphragms are now obscured related to some combination of pleural fluid and subsegmental atelectasis, the former most likely. Taking into account differences in projection, the heart and mediastinal contours are not significantly changed. Densely calcified atherosclerotic plaque is seen at both carotid bifurcations.
