ET tube is present 3.5 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is present with tip coursing towards the stomach but not captured on the film. An esophageal temperature probe is also noted. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Bilateral pleural effusions are not excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Diffuse hazy opacification of all lung fields is consistent with pulmonary edema.
