Overall similar appearance of the chest except for development of a patchy and linear opacity in the left retrocardiac region, which most likely represents localized atelectasis. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude the less likely possibility of developing pneumonia. Moderate to marked gastric distention is noted in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen and is incompletely imaged on this study.
