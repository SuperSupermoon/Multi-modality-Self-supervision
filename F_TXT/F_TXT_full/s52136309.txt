Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There are persistent low lung volumes. Cardiac size is top normal. Lines and tubes are in standard position. Bibasilar consolidations, left greater than right, are stable, could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Extensive bilateral ground-glass and reticular opacities, right greater than left, are stable. The etiology of this abnormality is unclear. One possibility still remains mild noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
