Volume of right pleural fluid has decreased substantially, basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter still in place. Right apical pneumothorax is barely visible. Consolidation remaining at the base of the right lung could be atelectasis or pneumonia. Atelectasis at the left lung base remains quite severe. Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has not improved ; presence of any pericardial effusion is radiographically indeterminate. There may be mild perihilar edema, but this is difficult to diagnose in the setting of effusions. Right PIC line ends in the upper SVC and an esophageal drainage tube passes into the upper stomach and out of view. No left pneumothorax.
