Since prior exam, a new femoral pacing wire has been placed, and is in its expected location overlying the right ventricle. An opacity at the left base suggests atelectasis and a possible pleural effusion, similar to the prior exam. There is also likely a small right pleural effusion. Mild pulmonary edema is similar. There is no focal opacity. No pneumothorax is identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with moderate cardiomegaly. A right PICC is unchanged with the tip in the low SVC.
