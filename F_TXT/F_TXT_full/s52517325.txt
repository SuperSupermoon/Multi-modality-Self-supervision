The lungs are mildly hyperinflated compatible with emphysema. The patient is post right upper lobe resection with postsurgical changes in the form of sutures projecting over the right hemi thorax. There is a small right apical pneumothorax with 2 right-sided chest tubes, their tip projecting over the right apex. Persistent, unchanged subcutaneous emphysema along the right lateral chest wall extending into the right lower neck. Cardiomediastinal silhouette otherwise appears unremarkable. Endotracheal tube, enteric tube, epidural catheter, right central venous catheter and EKG leads remain unchanged. Diffuse demineralization noted and a right thoracotomy defect noted.
