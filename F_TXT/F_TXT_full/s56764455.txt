1. Interval placement of a left subclavian central line which has its tip in the proximal superior vena cava, likely along the lateral wall. The heart remains enlarged status post median sternotomy for CABG. Although this may reflect cardiomegaly, a pericardial effusion cannot be entirely excluded. There is mild interstitial edema. There is likely a small, left greater than right layering effusions. The left costophrenic angle is not entirely included on the study. No pneumothorax is seen. There is also a rounded opacity in the aortopulmonary window, which may simply reflect a prominent pulmonary artery as this appears to be present on only some of the previous studies and therefore a vascular etiology would be more likely than lymphadenopathy.
