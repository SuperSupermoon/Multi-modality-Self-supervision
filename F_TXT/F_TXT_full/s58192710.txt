There are fractures of at least the right first through eighth ribs. Thickening of the right apical pleural margin adjacent to severely displaced rib fractures is local bleeding, pleural or extrapleural. New opacification over the right lung base is probable new hemothorax, layering posteriorly. Lungs are grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. ET tube and right subclavian line are in standard placements and a feeding tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. No detectable pneumothorax
