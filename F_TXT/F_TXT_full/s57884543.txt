Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates stable-appearing partially loculated moderate-sized right pleural effusion with adjacent right lower lobe and right middle lobe atelectasis. This is an unusually persistent post-operative fluid collection with a partial fissural component. Stable rightward shift of the mediastinum. Initially, there was concern over a linear lucency at the right superior mediastinum, but despite initial impression, it is ultimately felt that this does not represent pneumomediastinum. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Patient is status post CABG with median sternotomy wires in place.
