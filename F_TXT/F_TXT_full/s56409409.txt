In comparison with study of ___, there is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with the clinical impression of some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Striking enlargement of the region of the aortic knob and proximal descending aorta is again seen. The left hemidiaphragm is poorly visualized, suggesting pleural fluid and atelectatic changes of the underlying lung. Mild atelectatic changes are seen on the right.
