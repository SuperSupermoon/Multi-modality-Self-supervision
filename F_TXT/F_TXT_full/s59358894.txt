A comparison study of ___, monitoring and support devices have been removed except for a right IJ sheath. No evidence of pneumothorax. Probable small pneumomediastinum. However, this could possibly represent an air bronchogram and an area of retrocardiac opacification. Small left pleural effusion is seen. Streaks of atelectasis are noted at the right base.
