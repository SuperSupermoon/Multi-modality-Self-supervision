Lung volumes have improved and earlier mild interstitial edema has resolved. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Widening of the mediastinum at the level of the aortic arch is stable, could be a function of supine positioning, mediastinal fat deposition and low lung volumes. When feasible, up right conventional chest radiographic view should be obtained. Read if clinical history and findings are consistent with mediastinal injury, I would recommend chest CTA to look for vascular injury causing hematoma.
