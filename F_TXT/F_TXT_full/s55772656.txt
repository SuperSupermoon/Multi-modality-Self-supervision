As compared to ___ radiograph, the patient has been extubated. Bilateral pleural catheters remain in place, with a tiny left apical pneumothorax but no definite right pneumothorax. Right PICC terminates at the medial aspect of the right clavicle and is not the expected downward turn into the brachiocephalic vein towards the SVC. Exam is otherwise remarkable for improved pulmonary edema, decreased right basilar atelectasis, but persistent left lower lobe collapse and small to moderate left pleural effusion.
