Examination is limited secondary to patient body habitus, portable technique and apparent motion. There is no definite confluent consolidation although subtle opacities could certainly be missed. Enlargement of the right hilum which could represent pulmonary artery enlargement or adenopathy is noted. Cardiac silhouette is slightly prominent but this is likely accentuated by portable technique and positioning.
