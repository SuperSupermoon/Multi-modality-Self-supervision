As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, the right apical pneumothorax has improved. The distance between the right apical pleura and second rib is 1.8 cm. Mediastinal structures are midline. There is mild pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions remain unchanged. Opacities at lung bases are most readily explained by atelectasis. However, early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
