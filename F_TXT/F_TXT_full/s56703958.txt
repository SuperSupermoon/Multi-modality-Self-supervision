Portable semi-erect chest radiograph demonstrate clear lungs without a focal opacity convincing for pneumonia. 12 mm irregular opacity in the periphery of the right upper lobe is noted just below the right 6 posterior rib. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Atherosclerotic calcifications involve the aortic arch. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
