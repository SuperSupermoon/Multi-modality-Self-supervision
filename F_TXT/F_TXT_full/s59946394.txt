Mediastinum has a normal postoperative appearance, unchanged since ___:16 following removal of midline drains. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are smaller. Lungs are reasonably well expanded. There is no pulmonary edema. Left pleural tube is still in place, and there is still a miniscule left apical pneumothorax. Right jugular introducer ends at the thoracic inlet.
