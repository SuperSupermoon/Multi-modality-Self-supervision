CHEST AP The size of the right effusion present on the prior chest x-ray is diminished and a pigtail catheter is seen at the right lung base laterally. No pneumothorax is identified. Some mild opacity is seen overlying the right upper lung. This could be caused a small amount of pleural fluid. Infiltrates seems unlikely given the prior chest x-ray.
