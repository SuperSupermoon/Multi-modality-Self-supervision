The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Heart size is mildly enlarged, with a left ventricular predominance, with dense mitral annular calcifications noted. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with diffuse calcification of the aorta re- demonstrated. Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery is compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Diffuse alveolar opacities are worse when compared to the previous exam, and likely reflect moderate pulmonary edema. Trace right pleural effusion is noted. No pneumothorax is identified. Dense mitral annular calcifications are seen. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted within the imaged spine as well as within both shoulders.
