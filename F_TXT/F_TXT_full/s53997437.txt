Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There has been placement of two chest tubes on the left side. The pneumothorax is not well seen. There is again seen consolidation at the left base which is stable. Endotracheal tube tip is 3 cm above the carina. This could be pulled back 1 to 2 cm for more optimal placement. The right lung is grossly clear.
