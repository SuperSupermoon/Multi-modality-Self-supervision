A PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There are two pigtail catheters projecting over the left upper quadrant, one lateral and the other shortly to the left of midline. Small bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged, again greater on the left than right. The lungs appear clear. There is no pneumothorax.
