AP portable upright chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs appear clear bilaterally without signs of pneumonia or CHF. A dense nodule in the left mid lung is most compatible with a calcified granuloma. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable. No definite bony abnormality is seen.
