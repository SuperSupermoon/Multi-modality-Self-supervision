Since pulmonary vascular congestion and mild cardiomegaly are new since ___, I am tempted to attribute the region of new peribronchial opacification at the right lung base to dependent edema, exacerbated by elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and bronchovascular crowding in the right lower lobe. Even so, this area should be watched carefully for an alternative diagnosis, concurrent pneumonia. Severe degenerative changes noted at both shoulders. No appreciable left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
