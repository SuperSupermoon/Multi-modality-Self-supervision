The extent of right pleural or extrapleural bleeding is small, and has not increased since earlier in the day when concern was raised about interval widening of the right apical pleural margin, now considerably smaller than it was at 13:46. Aeration in the right lung has diminished, probably due to increasing bands of atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Left lung is grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, including a dilated or tortuous thoracic aorta. ET tube tip is partially obscured by spinal hardware, but ends at least 3 cm above the carina. Left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC, and a feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
