Large-bore right-sided hemodialysis catheter is again seen, unchanged in position, with tip in the right atrium. A right-sided PICC line again terminates over the right axilla. Relatively low lung volumes. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. Lucency projecting over the medial right mid-to-lower hemithorax corresponds to previously seen large loculated air and fluid collection and is less prominent as compared to the prior study. Sliver of lucency seen along the lateral right diaphragm likely corresponds to air along the pleural space as seen on prior chest CT. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. There appears to be decrease in pleural effusion along the right lateral wall compared to the prior study, though a small right pleural effusion likely persists. A very trace left pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ on ___ at both 8:00 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. in person.
