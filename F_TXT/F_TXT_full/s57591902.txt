Interval improvement in aeration at the right base with residual patchy opacity which may reflect resolving partial lower lobe atelectasis rather than aspiration or pneumonia. However, clinical correlation is advised. A linear opacity at the left base is unchanged and may reflect post-inflammatory scarring or subsegmental atelectasis. There continues to be emphysema with changes in both upper lungs. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are appreciated. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
