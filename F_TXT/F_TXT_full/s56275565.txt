Enteric tube tip is in the proximal stomach. There are multiple dilated small bowel loops, mildly improved since prior. Very shallow inspiration. Bibasilar opacities are new, likely atelectasis. Pneumonitis cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Shallow inspiration accentuates heart size, pulmonary vascularity. There may be tiny left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
