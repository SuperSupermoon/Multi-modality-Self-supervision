1. Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, nasogastric tube, left internal jugular central line, left subclavian central line are unchanged in the position. There is also possibly a catheter projecting over the right hemidiaphragm, although this may be extrinsic to the patient's and related to an EKG lead. 2. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. Probable small layering effusions. Interval improvement but residual mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
