At the left base, there is a suggestion of a rounded opacity behind the cardiac silhouette, which was not definitely present on the prior exam. Evaluation of this region is somewhat limited due to low lung volumes. Biapical left worse than right scarring is noted. No other focal opacity is identified. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Scoliosis in the upper thoracic spine is unchanged. Fracture of the proximal right humerus is old.
