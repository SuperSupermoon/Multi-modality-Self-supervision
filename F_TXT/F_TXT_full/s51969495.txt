The patient is rotated. ETT in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip projects over in the low SVC, unchanged. Lung volumes remain low with bronchovascular crowding. Persistent, bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis, mostly on the left, which have now improved from the prior exam. Retrocardiac opacity is consistent with atelectasis. Minimal residual right effusion. No pneumothorax. The heart remains mildly enlarged.
