Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomegaly is stable. Retrocardiac opacities have improved consistent with improved atelectasis. Right lower lobe opacities are stable, likely atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. There are low lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax. Lines and tubes are in standard position.
