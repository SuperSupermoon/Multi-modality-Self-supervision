CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Supine positioning. Multiple leads overlie the chest. There is probable cardiomegaly and upper zone redistribution, though these are likely accentuated by low lung volumes. There is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, new compared with a trauma series chest x-ray from ___ 9:30 a.m. There is also hazy opacity at the right base which may reflect atelectasis. Possible small left effusion. No plain film evidence of pneumothorax is identified.
