The right-sided Port-A-Cath has the distal tip in the mid SVC, unchanged from prior. There is unchanged cardiomegaly. There are bilateral pleural effusions and worsening of the left retrocardiac opacity. There is also mild worsening of the opacity within the right mid lung field which may represent loculated fluid versus developing infiltrate. There remains a tiny left apical pneumothorax, unchanged.
