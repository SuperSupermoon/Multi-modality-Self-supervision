Compared with the prior study, there may have been slight interval improvement in the bilateral alveolar opacities. A right subclavian central line projects over the upper right atrium, slightly more distal than on the prior study. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is the tracheostomy. An additional line courses over the right neck, right mediastinum, and visualized portion of the right upper abdomen, unchanged -- this apparently represents a VP shunt.
