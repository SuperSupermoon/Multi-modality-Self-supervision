COMPARED TO CHEST RADIOGRAPHS SINCE ___, MOST RECENTLY ___ THROUGH ___ AT 04:05. Bibasilar pulmonary consolidation accompanied by moderate pulmonary edema improved on ___, but has worsened substantially in the right middle and lower lobes particularly since earlier in the day. This is conceivably pneumonia, but the rapid change could also be due to pulmonary hemorrhage. I do not believe it is dependent edema since there is no concurrent increase in the mild edema in the upper lobes. Heart is normal size, although the right heart border is now obscured by right middle lobe consolidation. No pneumothorax. Indwelling right jugular sheath ends above the origin of the right brachiocephalic vein. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC. ET tube in standard placement. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
