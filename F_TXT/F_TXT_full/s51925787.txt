An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.4 cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter is appropriately positioned. An enteric tube courses to at least the body of the stomach, although the distal tip is not captured on the current study. Multifocal consolidation and smaller nodular opacities, some apparently cavitated, are due to widespread infection, including pneumonia and possible septic emboli. The lung apices are spared. Moderate cardiac enlargement, pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema mild edema and likely small bilateral pleural effusions reflect cardiac decompensation. Detection of pericardial effusion would require echocardiography.
