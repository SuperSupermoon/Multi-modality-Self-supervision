AP chest compared to ___ through ___: The right subclavian infusion port travels into the jugular system, where it bends sharply and may be kinked, returning to the upper SVC. There is no new mediastinal widening or tracheal displacement to suggest hematoma. Compared to the baseline examination in ___, all the areas of bronchiectasis appear more opacified than at their optimal appearance. This probably represents a flare of superinfection or generalized retention of secretions. The circumstances of pulmonary edema would probably look very much the same way and of course, I cannot exclude concurrent infection of the lung in addition to bronchiectasis.
