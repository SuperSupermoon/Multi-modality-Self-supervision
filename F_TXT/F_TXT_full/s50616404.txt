In comparison with the study of ___, monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Poor definition of the hemidiaphragms with haziness at the bases is consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent compressive atelectatic changes. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. However, asymmetry of opacification at the bases raises the possibility of superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
