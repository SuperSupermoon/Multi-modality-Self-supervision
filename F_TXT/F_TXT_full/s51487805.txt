AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Left ventricular lead ends in a position consistent with the venous drainage of the posterior wall of the left ventricle, but it is looped at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins. The right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead follow their expected courses. No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or associated mediastinal widening. Heart is moderately enlarged. There is no pulmonary edema. Leftward deviation of the trachea could be due to an enlarged right lobe of the thyroid gland or tortuous enlarged innominate artery. ___ was paged at 8:30 a.m.
