Previously reported focal opacity adjacent to the left hilum appears less discrete on the current radiograph, and is now contiguous with adjacent patchy and linear foci of atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and improving pulmonary edema. Heterogeneous opacities in the mid and lower lungs affecting the right lung to a greater degree than the left may be due to multifocal atelectasis or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, and note is also made of a moderate right pleural effusion, slightly decreased since the prior radiograph.
