AP chesty radiograph. Since the prior radiograph obtained yesterday, the current AP chest radiograph demonstrates interval progression of the right lower lung consolidation, most likely due to progression of the consolidation itself and increase in pleural effusion. Left basal opacity has progressed and there is also potentially developing left mid lung opacity, all of them concerning for multifocal infection. Tubes and lines are in unchanged position.
