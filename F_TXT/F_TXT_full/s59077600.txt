AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding AP and lateral chest examination of ___. The present frontal view again demonstrates the previously described marked cardiomegaly. Appearance of pulmonary vasculature has changed markedly with now prominent perivascular haze mostly over the bases with general distended pulmonary vasculature (plethora) indicating development of pulmonary congestion since the next preceding examination. Mild blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus may have increased slightly, indicating small amounts of pleural effusions. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is some evidence of contrast material location in a vertebral body of the upper thoracic spine, but skeletal detail on this portable chest examination is suboptimal.
