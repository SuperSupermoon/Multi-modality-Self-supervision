In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved. Airspace opacity at the left lung base has worsened, and additional patchy opacities have developed at the right lung base. Findings could potentially be due to aspiration or evolving aspiration pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Exam is otherwise remarkable for probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
