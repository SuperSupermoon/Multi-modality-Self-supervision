An endotracheal tube terminates 2.6 cm above the carina. The heart is normal in size. The aorta is tortuous. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The lungs appear mildly hyperinflated. Small streaky opacity at the base the left lung is most consistent with atelectasis, although infection is a possibility. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. No large focal consolidation is identified.
