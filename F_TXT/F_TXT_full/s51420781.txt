Comparison is made to previous study from ___ at 11:42 a.m. There is a left retrocardiac opacity and increased consolidation in the left mid to lower lung field, compatible with persistent pneumonia as seen on the prior study. Given the increased density, underlying pleural effusion or worsening of the pneumonia is possible. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema. The right lung is clear. Mediastinal contours are preserved.
