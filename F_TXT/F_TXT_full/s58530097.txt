AP chest compared to ___ at 8:15 a.m.: Tracheostomy tube extends roughly two-thirds the distance from the stomach to the carina. Lungs are still low in volume with atelectasis at the right base and atelectasis or pneumonia at the left. Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size, which is probably normal. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. New pneumoperitoneum, presumably reflects placement of percutaneous gastrostomy, often inserted at the same time of the tracheostomy tube.
