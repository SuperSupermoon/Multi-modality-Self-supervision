Interval repositioning of the nasogastric tube with the tip projecting over the stomach but the side port is near the gastroesophageal junction. Advancing would be advised to ensure that the side port is below the gastroesophageal junction to minimize the risk of aspiration. Small amount of free intraperitoneal air is seen beneath the right hemidiaphragm in this patient status post recent laparotomy. Lungs appear inflated with minimal patchy opacity at the left base likely reflecting an area of atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
