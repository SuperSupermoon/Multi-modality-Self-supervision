AP chest compared to ___, 11:55 a.m.: The peripheral consolidation that developed yesterday between 3 a.m. and noon in the left lower lobe has not resolved, and there is new similar opacification in the right upper lobe. This either represents a pneumonia or hemorrhage, particularly in the setting of coagulopathy or acute vasculitis. Heart size is top normal, exaggerated by very low lung volumes. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. ET tube in standard placement. Right subclavian line ends low in the SVC or upper right atrium. Nasogastric tube is looped in the stomach. Contrast agent retained in the kidneys suggests a severe compromise of renal function and/or ureteral drainage. Dr. ___ was paged at 9:50 a.m., as soon as the findings were recognized. Another member of the service was reached at 11:30AM and we discussed the findings by telephone then.
