In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little overall change. Again there is evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion with bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis more prominent on the left. A more focal area of increased opacification is seen at the right base, which could well reflect superimposed pneumonia.
