Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The pigtail catheter is in place. There is left basal opacity present, most likely consistent with a combination of atelectasis and partial re-expanding pulmonary edema. There is vague calcification projecting over the left lower lung might reflect underlying mass, but precise assessment with chest CT is required. There is also interval increase in pneumothorax, apical, but currently moderate as compared to small seen on the prior study.
