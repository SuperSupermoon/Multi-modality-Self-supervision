Single portable view of the chest. Left PICC is no longer visualized. The patient remains rotated to the left. The right lung is grossly clear. There is dense retrocardiac opacity seen laterally silhouetting the lateral aspect of the hemidiaphragm. Osseous structures are again notable for partially visualized lower thoracic spinal hardware which is not well assessed. No free air is seen below the diaphragm on this semi-erect film.
