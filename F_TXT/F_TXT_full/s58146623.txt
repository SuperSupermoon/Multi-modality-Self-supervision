As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new third left-sided chest tube. The other multiple right and left-sided chest and mediastinal tubes are unchanged. There is a minimal pneumothorax restricted to the left lung bases, in the region of the costophrenic sinus, adjacent to known left lateral rib fractures. No apical pneumothorax is visible on the CT examination. Unchanged other monitoring and support devices with rather extensive right chest wall opacity and borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Minimal soft tissue air inclusion in the left lateral soft tissues.
