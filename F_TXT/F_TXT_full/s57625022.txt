Unremarkable mediastinal and hilar contours. Heart size is top normal. Redemonstration of the known right lower lobe mass with overall worsening opacification of the right basilar lung zones, not an unexpected finding given recent surgery and may reflect edema though worsening of known consolidations cannot be definitively excluded. Possible small right pleural effusion. No osseous abnormality identified.
