Lines and tubes are similar to the prior film. As before, the ET tube tip lies at the level of the mid clavicular heads approximately 6.1 cm above the carina. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly prominent but unchanged. Again seen is vascular plethora and vascular blurring, consistent with CHF, likely with an element of pulmonary edema. Also again seen is hazy opacity at both lung bases suggesting bilateral pleural effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
