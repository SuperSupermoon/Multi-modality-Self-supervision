The endotracheal tube tip is 6.8 cm above the carina. The right IJ central catheter terminates in the lower SVC. No pneumothorax. No significant change in the vascular engorgement and bilateral interstitial pulmonary edema, worse on the left. It is difficult to decipher how much of this is due to chronic interstitial disease. Cardiac silhouette is unchanged, as is the right pacer/defibrillator with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. Left subclavian and left IJ stents are also unchanged.
