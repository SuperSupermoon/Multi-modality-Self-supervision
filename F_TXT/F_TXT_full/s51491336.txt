In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Cardiac size is within normal limits. Opacification is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and layering effusion. Less prominent atelectatic changes are seen at the right with the hemidiaphragm much more sharply seen, suggesting some improvement in pleural effusion. No definite pneumonia is appreciated; however, in the appropriate clinical setting, the asymmetry of opacification in the left mid zone could reflect developing consolidation rather than be related to a layering effusion.
