CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Right IJ central line tip not optimally visualized, but likely overlies distal SVC/RA junction. An NG tube is present, extending beneath diaphragm. There is cardiomegaly, unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is hazy opacity at the right base which likely represents some pleural fluid, together with atelectasis. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged, with small left effusion.
