Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion, accompanying right lung atelectasis is unchanged since ___. Increased retrocardiac density on the left side and reflecting left lower lung volume loss and probably small left pleural effusion is also similar. Right internal jugular catheter sheath tip is at upper/mid SVC. There is evidence of prior median sternotomy and sternal sutures are intact, consistent with status post AVR. Mild to moderately enlarged heart size and minimally widened mediastinum suggesting mediastinal congestion is unchanged.
