Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. Following tracheal extubation, right upper lobe is now extremely hyperlucent, but looking for any other findings to suggest pneumothorax, I find none. Instead I see new atelectasis in the superior segment of the upper lobe an increase in moderate right pleural effusion. Moderate left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary edema are still present. The heart is normal size. Right jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. Nasogastric drainage tube has been removed, but the stomach is not particularly distended.
