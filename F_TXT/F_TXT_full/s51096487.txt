An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating just below the thoracic inlet, 5.3 cm above the carina. A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged with a single lead terminating right ventricular apex. A small to moderate left apical pneumothorax is unchanged from the outside chest radiograph and appears opacified by apical fluid on the most recent prior study. There is interval increased opacification of the bilateral lung bases on the left greater than the right. The left lingular and basilar opacification appears complex, corresponding to complex loculated penumathoraces and adjacent parenchymal opacities better seen on the outside CT. Right basilar opacification likely reflects a combination of layering pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis. The right border of the cardiac silhouette is normal in appearance. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits and unchanged.
