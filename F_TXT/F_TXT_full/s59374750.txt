The endotracheal tube tip is 5 cm above the carina. The endogastric tube courses inferiorly out of field of view. A right-sided central venous catheter tip terminates at the upper-to-mid SVC. The heart size is exaggerated by positioning and low lung volumes. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The lung volumes are low with bibasilar consolidations likely representing atelectasis. The aerated portions of the lung demonstrate pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. Overall, the appearance is similar to prior exam.
