Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Calcified lymph nodes are present in the right hilar region as well as a calcified granuloma in the right upper lobe. Patchy opacity in left retrocardiac region is new, and may reflects patchy atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. Acute aspiration is an additional consideration in the appropriate clinical setting. Note is also made of apparent rightward deviation of the trachea, at the level of the thoracic inlet. This is difficult to evaluate on a portable radiograph, particularly as the patient's neck appears to be turned towards the right on this exam.
