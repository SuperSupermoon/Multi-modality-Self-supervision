Prior left pleural effusion is no longer seen. Vague opacity projecting over the left lung laterally is compatible with pleural based scarring seen on prior CT. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. Mild cardiac enlargement is unchanged. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic arch. Old right lateral rib fractures are noted.
