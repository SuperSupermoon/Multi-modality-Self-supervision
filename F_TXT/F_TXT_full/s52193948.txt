Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities within the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely reflects chronic pleural thickening, as seen previously. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
