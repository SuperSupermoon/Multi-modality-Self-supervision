AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Tracheostomy tube is midline, but more horizontally oriented, perhaps with an appreciably shorter intratracheal excursion than on ___. Conventional radiographs, particularly a lateral view, would be helpful in assessing the orientation of the tracheostomy tube. Right lung is low in volume with mild right basal atelectasis, but less vascular congestion today than on ___. Left lower lobe is densely consolidated as before with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, indicating substantial volume loss. This obscures the left heart border, making cardiac assessment difficult, but mediastinal venous engorgement is definitely still present. Right supraclavicular central venous catheter ends low in the SVC or right atrium, and there is no pneumothorax.
