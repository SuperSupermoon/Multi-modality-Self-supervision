Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 6.6 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, the inferior aspect not definitively included on the exam. There are low lung volumes. Prominence and indistinctness of the hila suggest a component of fluid overload. Slight blunting of left costophrenic angle is seen and a trace left pleural effusion is not excluded. No displaced fractures are identified. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are likely accentuated by supine, AP technique. The superior mediastinum is somewhat ill-defined, although this may relate to low lung volumes, supine AP portable technique, and volume overload. Chest CT is pending.
