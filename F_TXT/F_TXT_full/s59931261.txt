Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses distal to the gastroesophageal junction, with tip off the inferior borders of the film. The side-port however appears proximal to the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced by at least 5 cm. Numerous mediastinal clips are demonstrated. Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged. Perihilar ill-defined opacities are more pronounced on the right, and most likely reflective of moderate asymmetric pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly visualized.
