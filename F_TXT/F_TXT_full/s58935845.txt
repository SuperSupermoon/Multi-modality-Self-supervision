AP chest compared to ___: A calcific left fibrothorax obscures much of the left lung. Right lower lobe is consolidated, conceivably atelectasis, since it is homogeneous and extends all the way to the diaphragmatic surface, accompanied by at least a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion. ET tube and left internal jugular line are in standard placements respectively. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is recently unchanged, and persistent azygos distention suggests elevated right central venous pressure.
