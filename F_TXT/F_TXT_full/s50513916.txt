Assessment is limited due to positioning. Allowing for this limitation, there is decreased volume in the right upper chest along with right hilar surgical clips and rightward deviation of the trachea suggestive of prior right upper lobectomy. There are bibasilar patchy opacities with associated bronchiectasis. No pleural effusion is identified bilaterally. There is no pneumothorax. The heart is not enlarged. A thick calcification is seen abutting the right hemidiaphragm.
