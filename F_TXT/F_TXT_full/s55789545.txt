A supine portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube with the tip obscured by overlying support lines and tubes, but appears to terminate 2.5 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image. Metallic clips are again seen in the right axilla. Lung volumes are low, resulting in increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. Free air seen under the right hemidiaphragm on the prior radiograph is not well as well appreciated on this exam.
