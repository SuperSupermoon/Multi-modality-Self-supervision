Portable frontal view of the chest demonstrates stable appearance of the chest with persistent near complete opacification of the left hemithorax with a small lucent area in the upper left lung. The right lung remains clear with no right pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A catheter projects over the mid left hemithorax which could be external to the patient but could represent a PleurX catheter.
