AP chest compared to ___: Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Right upper lobe vascular engorgement suggests cardiac decompensation as well as mild pulmonary edema. More focal opacification in the lower lungs could be atelectasis alone or in combination with dependent edema or even pneumonia. The leftward mediastinal shift is exaggerated by patient's positioning, but is a good indication that most of the consolidatation in the left lower lobe is collapse. Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach. Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead curves upward projecting over the right ventricular apex. No pneumothorax.
