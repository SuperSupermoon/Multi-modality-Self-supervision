Right chest tube remains in place, with decreasing very small right apical pneumothorax. Pneumomediastinum persists, but previously evident pneumoperitoneum is less well visualized, possibly due to positional differences between the studies. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by minimal perihilar edema. Slightly more confluent opacity is present in the right infrahilar region. This may relate to atelectasis, aspiration, or developing infectious pneumonia. Subcutaneous emphysema has slightly improved, particularly in the right supraclavicular area.
