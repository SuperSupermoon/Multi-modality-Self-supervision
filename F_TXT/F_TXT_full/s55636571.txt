Comparison is made to a previous study from ___. There is a right-sided pacemaker with distal lead tips in the right atrium and right ventricle. No pneumothoraces are seen. There is an unchanged left retrocardiac opacity. There is again seen a PICC line with the distal tip poorly visualized and overlapping with the pacemaker leads, but it appears to be in the proximal right atrium.
