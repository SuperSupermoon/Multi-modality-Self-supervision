In comparison with the study of ___, the study is somewhat limited due to the scattered radiation related to the size of the patient. Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Retrocardiac opacification makes it difficult to assess for lower lung abnormality which would require a lateral view. Opacification in the costophrenic angle on the left could be due to overlying density. A repeat study, especially including a lateral view, would be most helpful if the condition of the patient would permit.
