Tip of endotracheal tube terminates approximately 7.5 cm above the carina, and could be advanced a few centimeters for standard positioning communicated directly to the ICU team during Radiology-ICU rounds on ___ at 8:45 a.m. at the time of discovery. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Asymmetrically distributed airspace opacities involving the right mid and lower lung to a greater degree than the left have worsened, and may be due to asymmetrical edema with or without underlying infectious consolidation or aspiration. Peripheral interstitial edema at the lung bases is unchanged. There has been rapid interval worsening of a left retrocardiac opacity which most likely represents atelectasis. Small pleural effusions are present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
