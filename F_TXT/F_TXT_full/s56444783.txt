AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position terminating some 5 cm above the level of the carina. A right-sided PICC line apparently has been advanced slightly from its previous position and terminates now in the lower SVC. Multiple external wires and lines are overlying the chest. No other indwelling line can be identified. There is no pneumothorax and no new parenchymal infiltrates are identified beyond the previously identified basal atelectasis.
