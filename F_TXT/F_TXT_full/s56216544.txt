Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Cardiac size is top normal. Right apical atelectasis has improved. Left lower lobe atelectasis is grossly unchanged. Right lower lobe opacities are new, worrisome for developing infection and/or aspiration. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
