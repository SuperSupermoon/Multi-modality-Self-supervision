AP chest compared to ___, most recently 11:31 a.m.: ET tube is in standard placement. Nasogastric tube is looped several times in the stomach terminating in the region of the pylorus. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and moderate cardiomegaly accompanied by mild interstitial edema have all worsened since most recent prior study. The large region of opacification at the right lung base is probably an elevated hemidiaphragm, while on the left there could be new consolidation due to pneumonia or aspiration, but all the findings could be explained by atelectasis and heart failure.
