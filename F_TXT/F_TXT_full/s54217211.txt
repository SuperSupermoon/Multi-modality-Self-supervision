There is improving aeration in both lungs suggestive of resolving pulmonary edema. Residual patchy opacity is seen at both bases which may reflect atelectasis or subsegmental atelectasis, less likely pneumonia. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient rotation. No pneumothorax.
