As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, lung volumes are decreased accentuating the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours. Endotracheal tube terminates 2.6 cm above the carina. There is a new right IJ central venous catheter with its tip terminating in the distal SVC. The heart is enlarged. There is collapse of the left lower lobe. Bilateral opacities likely reflect a combination of pleural fluid and atelectasis. No evidence of free air in this frontal chest radiograph.
