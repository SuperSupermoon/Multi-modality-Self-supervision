Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.9 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube is coiled within the stomach. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the SVC. The heart is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. Bilateral perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness is compatible with mild pulmonary edema. Bilateral hilar enlargement is also noted which could reflect underlying lymphadenopathy or pulmonary arterial hypertension. Additionally, ill-defined nodular opacities are noted throughout both lungs, with some appearing cavitary, such as a 12 mm lesion within the left lung base. Bandlike opacities within both lung bases may reflect focal atelectasis. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a small pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is detected. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the imaged thoracolumbar spine.
