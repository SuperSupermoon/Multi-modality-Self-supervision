AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained seven hours earlier during the same day. It is assumed that exchange of ET tube has been performed during the interval. Radiographically, the ETT now terminates about 1-2 cm lower than it was appreciated on the preceding study. The position is acceptable while it still is a few centimeters above the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. Previously described left-sided internal jugular approach central venous line remains in unchanged position. Evidence of hazy densities, partially obscuring the diaphragms, similar as before and most likely represents pleural effusion layering partially in posterior pleural compartments as the patient is in semi-erect position. No significant interval change in comparison with previous study.
