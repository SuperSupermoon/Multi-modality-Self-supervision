Lordotic positioning. An ET tube is present, the tip is not optimally visualized but appears to lies 4 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present; again, this is poorly visualized in the lower mediastinum due to underpenetration, and the position of the tip can therefore not be evaluated. There are low inspiratory volumes. Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Compared with ___ at 4:09 a.m., there is increased retrocardiac density, with new obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is probably upper zone redistribution without overt CHF. Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles suggests small bilateral effusions. No pneumothorax is identified. Left subclavian central line tip overlies the proximal SVC.
