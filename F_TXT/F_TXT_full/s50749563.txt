Interval placement of right internal jugular central venous catheter, with tip in the mid superior vena cava. There is no pneumothorax. Persistent cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate pulmonary edema. Rapidly worsening left retrocardiac opacity is probably a combination of atelectasis and effusion, but underlying infectious consolidation is also possible. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
