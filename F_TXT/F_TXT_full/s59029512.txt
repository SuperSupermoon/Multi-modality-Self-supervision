As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal tube now projects 2.7 cm above the carina. The course of the right PICC line is unchanged. Unchanged lung volumes and unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. Again displayed are bilateral areas of parenchymal opacities, suggestive of atelectasis and a plate-like atelectasis that has newly occurred in the left perihilar region. No evidence of pneumothorax. No larger pleural effusions.
