Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The right chest tube has been removed. The substantial amount of air within the upper right hemithorax is unchanged. The lower lung remains collapsed, and there is potentially mild interval increase in the pleural effusion. Left lung is clear. Epidural catheter is in place.
