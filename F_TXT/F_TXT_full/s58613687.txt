Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained. Compared with the previous examination a similar degree of perihilar opacity with slight decrease in interstitial thickening is consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. The density of the left lower lobe/retrocardiac opacity is such that an infectious consolidation may be obscured in this area. Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. The heart remains mild to moderately enlarged with calcified aortic knob.
