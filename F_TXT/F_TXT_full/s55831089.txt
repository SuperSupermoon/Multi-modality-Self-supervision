There has been interval removal of the endotracheal tube. Two endogastric tubes course into the stomach; one of which side port is well below the GE junction; the other of which tip sits in the gastric antrum or early duodenum. The left-sided PICC tip sits in the mid SVC. The right-sided central line tip sits in the lower SVC. The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unremarkable. The lungs show no lobar consolidation. Additionally, indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm suggests small amount of pleural fluid and atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
