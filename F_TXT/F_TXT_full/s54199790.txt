A nasoenteric tube is present. The tip overlies the distal stomach. Of note, the radiopaque portion is not the same size as on the prior film, suggesting a different tube. Compared with the prior film common inspiratory volumes are slightly lower the cardiomediastinal silhouette is more prominent. Films also were lordotic . Allowing for technical differences, no definite interval change. No overt CHF or focal consolidation. No effusion. No findings suggestive of aspiration.
