In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of a right pigtail catheter with apparent decrease in the layering pleural effusion. However, there also has been decrease in the layering effusion on the left, raising the possibility that some of the apparent improvement on the right is merely due to a more erect position of the patient. No definite pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube is been removed and replaced with a tracheostomy, which appears well seated without evidence of pneumomediastinum. Otherwise, little change.
