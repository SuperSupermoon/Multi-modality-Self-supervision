The lungs are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, suggestive of emphysematous disease. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable with the exception of extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta. Biapical pleural parenchymal scarring is present. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An endotracheal tube ends 2.7 cm above the carina and an NG tube is present with the tip at the gastroesophageal junction and the side port within the terminal esophagus. Calcifications in the right neck and right subclavicular region are likely vascular.
