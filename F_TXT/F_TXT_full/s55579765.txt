Low lung volumes are noted. There is a moderate-large left and small right pleural effusion, some increase on the prior examination. The left hemidiaphragm and left heart border are obscured, likely secondary to pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Additionally, there is bilateral hilar prominence and cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature, suggestive of pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured but appears enlarged, unchanged as compared to the prior examination. Moderate-severe, right acromioclavicular joint degenerative changes are noted.
