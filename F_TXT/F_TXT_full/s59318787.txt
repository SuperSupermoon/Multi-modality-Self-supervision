Severe and somewhat asymmetric bilateral pulmonary consolidation has varied in severity and distribution since the admission radiograph on ___. It is less severe today than on ___ although moderate bilateral pleural effusion has been increasing since that time. Combination of findings suggest likely concurrent pulmonary edema and pneumonia. The right middle ribs have chronic and possibly acute fractures, and there is the question of bone destruction in the antero lateral left sixth rib. Lines and tubes are standard placements. Heart is normal size. Previous mediastinal widening has improved suggesting a decrease in distension of mediastinal veins. Whether there is mediastinal adenopathy can only be resolved by chest CT scanning which would also examine the chest cage abnormalities and previously cited cavitation in the right lung, a clear indication of pneumonia.
