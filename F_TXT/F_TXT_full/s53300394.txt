As compared to the previous image, there is no relevant change. Mild, potentially increased atelectasis at the left lung base, the presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. The right chest tube is in unchanged position. There currently is no evidence of right pneumothorax. The nasogastric tube is unchanged. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Minimal increase in right basal density, likely to be caused by a lesser inspiratory effort. Unchanged appearance of the heart.
