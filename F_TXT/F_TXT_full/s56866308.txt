The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are stable. The mild bilateral pulmonary edema is stable compared to the prior exam. There are no pleural effusions, or evidence of a pneumothorax. There appears to be an interval increase in the left lower lobe atelectasis, however no other new focal consolidations are seen. Again seen are post-surgical changes related to the sternotomy wires and CABG.
