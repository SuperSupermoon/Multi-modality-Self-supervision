There is increased interstitial pulmonary edema which is now moderate. Additionally, there are bibasilar opacities which likely reflect a combination of edema and effusions. However, relative increased density within the right base as compared to the left may be secondary to early pneumonia. Close interval followup is recommended. A previously described lingular opacity is obscured on the current examination. There is no pneumothorax. Mildly enlarged cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
