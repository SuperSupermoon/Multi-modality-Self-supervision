Patient has severe emphysema much more extensive and confluent consolidation has developed in the right lower lung, and more heterogeneous opacification has developed in the left over the past 4 days. Although this could be asymmetric edema, I would favor extensive pneumonia and perhaps only a component of edema since mediastinal veins are not dilated. On the other hand the left hilus, perhaps the heart, and left upper lobe vessel are larger. Small right pleural effusion has increased. ET tube is in standard placement, feeding tube loops in the stomach and passes out of view, and the right PIC line ends low in the SVC. No pneumothorax.
