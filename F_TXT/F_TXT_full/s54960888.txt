A right internal jugular central venous line has been placed with the tip terminating at approximately the cavoatrial junction. The course of the line is unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The appearance of the chest is otherwise unchanged from the most recent prior study with mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
