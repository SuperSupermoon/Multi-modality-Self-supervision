No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison. Rotated positioning. Heart is at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged. There is increased retrocardiac density with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is also some focal opacity at the right base, which could reflect the presence of consolidation or aspiration. No gross right effusion, though a small effusion would be difficult to exclude. The vascular markings are prominent, but there is no upper zone redistribution to confirm the presence of CHF. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present and it appears to extend beneath the diaphragm. The side port lies near the GE junction and does not definitely extend beyond the GE junction. There is apparent artifact due to an overlying cooling blanket. No pneumothorax is detected on this semi-erect rotated view.
