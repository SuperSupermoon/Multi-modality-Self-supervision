In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the enlarged heart. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect elevation of pulmonary venous pressure as suggested in the Clinical History. Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm suggests a combination of volume loss in the left lower lobe and small pleural effusion. No definite acute focal pneumonia.
