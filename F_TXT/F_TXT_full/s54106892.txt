The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are normal. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. The lungs are clear. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. A linear lucency near the medial right hemidiaphragm most likely reflects superimposition of the lower cortex of the adjacent medial right rib in conjunction with overlying pulmonary vasculature rather than trace free air under the medial right hemidiaphragm.
