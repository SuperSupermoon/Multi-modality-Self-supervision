Bilateral lung volumes are low. Because of the gross rotation, assessment of the cardiomediastinal silhouette was limited. A vague opacity in the right lower lung could be function of rotation and low lung volumes or true abnormality secondary to a combination of atelectasis and/or small pleural effusion. Right upper and left lung are without opacities of concern. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
