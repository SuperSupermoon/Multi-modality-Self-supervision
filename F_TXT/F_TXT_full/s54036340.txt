A tracheostomy is in-situ, unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study. Lung volumes are low, this limits assessment. A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid to distal SVC. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is incompletely visualized. An IVC filter is seen in the upper abdomen. A gastrostomy tube is incompletely visualized. Even allowing for the projection, the heart is enlarged. Bilateral airspace opacities are again seen. This is more confluent in the right upper lobe than on the prior study. Appearances remain concerning for infection.
