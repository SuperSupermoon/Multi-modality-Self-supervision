New hazy opacification of the right hemithorax likely represents a combination of new parenchymal opacity and layering fluid. New small left pleural effusion is seen. No pneumothorax is evident on this view. There is possibly new pneumomediastinum. Heart size is within normal limits. The stomach is distended with air. Metallic densities projecting over the left upper quadrant likely reflect recent splenic embolization. Right rib fractures are better seen on recent prior CT.
