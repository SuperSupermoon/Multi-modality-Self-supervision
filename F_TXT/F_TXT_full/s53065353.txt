Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from ___. Indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are seen bilaterally. Blunting of the costophrenic angle and silhouetting the hemidiaphragm suggestive of bilateral effusions. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears enlarged, likely slightly accentuated by low inspiratory effort. Median sternotomy wires are noted, now with a fracture of the top two wires. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
