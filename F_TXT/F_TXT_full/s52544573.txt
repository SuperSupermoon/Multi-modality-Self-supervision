Allowing for differences in technique, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is cardiomegaly, with upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis, without frank consolidation. Possible minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle which, if real, is new. Old healed left sided rib fractures again noted. Irregular density overlying a compressed vertebral body in the region of the thoracolumbar junction is compatible with vertebroplasty with extruded cement, better visualized on CT from ___.
