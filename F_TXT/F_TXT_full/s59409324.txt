Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates tracheostomy tube in standard position. The left internal jugular central venous catheter tip is in the low SVC. As compared to the prior study, the large right pleural effusion is relatively unchanged and the moderate left pleural effusion is slightly improved, although this may be due to patient positioning. Left lower lobe collapse persists. Stable cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax or strong evidence for pneumonia.
