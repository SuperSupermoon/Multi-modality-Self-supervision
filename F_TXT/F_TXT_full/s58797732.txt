Hyperinflation, flattening of the diaphragms, and reticular interstitial opacities are unchanged from prior studies and consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Ill-defined opacities at bilateral lung bases could represent infection, aspiration, or pulmonary edema in the proper clinical setting. Differentiation of these entities is difficult due to underlying extensive pulmonary parenchymal disease. Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. Pleural effusions are small if present at all. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and mild levoscoliosis of the thoracic spine are unchanged.
