The right chest tube remains in place. Compared with the prior study, an oblong locule of air at the right lung apex is slightly larger. The large rind of fluid density along the right lung apex and upper right chest wall remains visible. On the current exam, this appearance suggests a relatively large hydropneumothorax around the right upper lung, with a width of approximately 2.7 cm, with associated slight depression of the apex of the lung itself. Note is again made of parenchymal changes in the right lung apex, with chain sutures, and ITB valves. The small right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation is similar to the prior study. Possible mild volume loss on the right, given suggestion of slight hyperinflation of left lung. Apical changes in left lung are similar. No gross left lung effusion.
