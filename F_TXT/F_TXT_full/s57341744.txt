The tip of the endotracheal tube is 5.5 cm from the carina. Enteric tube tip is in the stomach. Bilateral parenchymal opacities have slightly improved on the right, unchanged on the left. This reveals tiny nodular opacities in the right midlung, which may relate to infection or nodules. These, along with the retrocardiac opacity possibly indicates multifocal infection. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
