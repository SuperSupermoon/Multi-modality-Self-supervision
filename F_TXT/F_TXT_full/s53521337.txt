Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent left upper lobe and right perihilar opacities, which are slightly improved as compared to the prior study. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. A nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. The tip of the endotracheal tube is obscured by the overlying cervical collar. There is no pneumothorax, significant pleural effusion, or consolidation.
