The lungs are hyperexpanded. There is a background of emphysema. There is a questionable opacity in the right lower lung, which would be better evaluated with chest CT. Calcifications along the left chest laterally suggest calcified pleural plaques. Scarring may account for obscuration of the left costophrenic angle. There may also be calcified pleural plaques projecting over the right lung laterally as well. No pneumothorax is seen. Heart size is normal. The aorta is calcified, indicating atherosclerosis. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
