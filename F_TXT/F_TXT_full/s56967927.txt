The right PICC tip now appears to terminate in the right atrium and should be retracted 3 cm to place in the low SVC. A tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position. Multiple mediastinal wires are aligned and intact. A tricuspid valve ring is noted. In comparison to the most recent prior study, there has been interval right thoracentesis with significant decrease in size of right pleural effusion, now with small residual pleural fluid in the right lung base. The right lung is well aerated. No pneumothorax is detected. The left lung base demonstrates persistent opacification, likely a combination of pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis. Mild residual atelectasis is present in the right lung base. There is persistent mild pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stably prominent.
