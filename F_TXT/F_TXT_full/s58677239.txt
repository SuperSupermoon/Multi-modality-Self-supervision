Semi-erect portable chest radiograph demonstrates extensive soft tissue gas outlining the pectoral muscles bilaterally, and in the subcutaneous tissues on the right. There is a moderate right-sided pneumothorax. Lung markings are not well appreciated due to overlying subcutaneous gas, there is a left base opacity. There is a discrepancy between the size of the lungs, with the right lung appearing larger. The trachea is midline, there is no shift of the cardiomediastinal silhouette to suggest tension. An endotracheal tube is in place, with its tip approximately 5 cm from the level of the carina. An orogastric tube is noted, the tip is not seen though it is below the level of the diaphragm. There is a left subclavian catheter, with its tip in the lower SVC.
