Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates normal lung volumes. There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. Heart size is normal. Left costophrenic angle is not fully imaged; however, pleural density involving the left lateral hemithorax in the lower lobe is longstanding and likely represents pleural thickening and/or effusion.
