As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone a wedge resection in the right lung. There is a relatively large air collection in the soft tissues surrounding the right hemithorax. A right chest tube is in place. Multiple linear opacities along the pectoral muscle project over the right hemithorax, so that no pneumothorax can be clearly identified. Low lung volumes. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette and known tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Unremarkable left lung. No other relevant changes.
