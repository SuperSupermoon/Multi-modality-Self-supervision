Bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with interval decrease size of small left apical pneumothorax, and similar appearance of a very small right apicolateral pneumothorax. Interval worsening opacity in the left lower lobe, which may be due to atelectasis, or aspiration given the rapid change. Right lung is hyperexpanded but grossly clear, and widening of the mediastinum appears stable. Endotracheal tube continues to terminate at the thoracic inlet level, but note is made of apparent overdistention of the endotracheal tube cuff.
