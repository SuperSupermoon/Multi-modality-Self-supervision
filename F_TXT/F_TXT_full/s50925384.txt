Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. The NG tube is coiled in the proximal stomach continuing up towards the esophagus with its tip being at the level of the distal esophagus and should be readjusted. The heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. Lungs are hyperinflated but essentially clear. Calcified right paratracheal lymph node is unchanged in appearance.
