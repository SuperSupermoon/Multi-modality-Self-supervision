AP chest submitted for review on ___ compared to ___: Tip of the endotracheal tube 4 cm above the carina in standard position. Sharp definition of the upper margin of the cuff reflects secretions pooling above it. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach, but would need to be advanced 10 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Lungs are low in volume, and aside from minimal left infrahilar atelectasis, essentially clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
