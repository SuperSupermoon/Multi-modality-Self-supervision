1. Interval removal of the right chest tube. There is increasing opacity within the right middle and lower lungs suggestive of partial middle and lower lobe atelectasis. There is also some right lateral pleural opacity which could represent a component of fluid. Given the degree of volume loss, there is mediastinal and cardiac shift to the right. No definite pleural line is visualized on the current examination, although a small pneumothorax is likely; therefore, followup imaging would be advised. The left lung is grossly clear and well inflated. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the mediastinal shift. There continues to be subcutaneous emphysema within the lateral chest and neck soft tissues. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Hardware overlies lower cervical spine consistent with prior fusion. Left mid lung nodule is unchanged since ___, consistent with a granuloma. Postoperative contour to the right mediastinal and hilar region in this patient status post known right upper lobectomy. Results were discussed by phone with the patient's house staff, ___, on ___ at 3:30 p.m.
