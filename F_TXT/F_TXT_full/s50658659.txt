Single portable AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates mild cardiomegaly. Opacity at the left lung base is present as is streaky opacity at the right lung base. While findings may reflect sequela of atelectasis, infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. There is mild central vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. There is no large pleural effusion, of the left costophrenic angle partially imaged.
