AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained six hours earlier during the same day. Position of the ETT has now been adjusted. It is seen to terminate some 2 cm above the level of the carina. Thus, no remaining danger of obstructing the main left bronchus. The present film does not cover the entire chest area, but in comparison with the next preceding study, no other new abnormalities can be identified. It can be mentioned that the NG tube has been advanced by some 10 cm so that the side port is now also located below the diaphragm level.
