Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Apparent leftward deviation of the trachea above the thoracic inlet appears to be due to leftward rotation of the neck. Lungs are clear. Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, a metallic foreign body reflecting a bullet is seen overlying the right upper quadrant, with adjacent right upper quadrant lucency, which may represent postoperative free intraperitoneal air in this patient who has undergone recent abdominal surgery.
