1. The patient is markedly rotated on the current examination. The lung volumes are diminished. There continue to be layering bilateral effusions with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature, but no overt pulmonary edema. The endotracheal tube and right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter are likely in unchanged position. There are external pacing wires overlying the patient. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. However, the stomach is now distended with air. No evidence of pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given patient rotation on the current study.
