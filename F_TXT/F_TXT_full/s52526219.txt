Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.6 cm from the carina. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pulmonary edema. Streaky and linear opacities in the lung bases are compatible with areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. A 6 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left mid lung field may reflect a calcified granuloma. There is no focal consolidation. There is gaseous distention of the stomach. Widening of the right acromioclavicular joint suggests prior type II AC joint separation.
