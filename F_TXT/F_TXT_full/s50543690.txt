Single AP portable frontal view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes. Perihilar and bibasilar opacities may relate to fluid overload, although underlying aspiration or even infection is not excluded. The patient is status post median sternotomy. No large pleural effusion is seen, although a small effusion would be difficult to exclude on the left. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and unremarkable.
