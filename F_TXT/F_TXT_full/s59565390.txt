Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube is in place, terminating 4 cm above the carina, and a nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach, but the side port is just above the expected location of the GE junction, and advancement by a few centimeters would be helpful for standard positioning if warranted clinically. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Lung volumes are slightly greater than on the prior study, with marked improved aeration at both bases, with residual patchy and linear atelectasis remaining, left greater than right. Possible small left pleural effusion.
