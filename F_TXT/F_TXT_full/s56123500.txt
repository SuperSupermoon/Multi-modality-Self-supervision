Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged. Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. There is no evident pneumothorax. Widened mediastinum is stable. Large left pleural effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient with adjacent atelectasis. The right lung is grossly clear. Pulmonary edema has improved, almost resolved.
