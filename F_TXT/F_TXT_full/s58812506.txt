AP chest compared to ___: New ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Lung volumes have improved, and mild pulmonary edema is more uniformly distributed. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly has improved possibly because of positive pressure ventilator support. No pneumothorax.
