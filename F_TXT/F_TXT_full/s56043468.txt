Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right internal jugular line terminates at the level of cavoatrial junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly. Small pleural effusion is noted bilaterally, left more than right. Small amount of pneumopericardium is expected. As compared to the prior study, there is slight interval increase in the mediastinal width. Given the drop in hematocrit, mediastinal hematoma is a possibility and repeated radiograph is recommended for documentation of stability. Otherwise, chest CT might be considered to exclude the possibility of intra-mediastinal bleeding. No pneumothorax is seen.
