Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal and hilar contours. Double right-sided heart contour is suggestive of left atrial enlargement. Coarsened interstitium is noted throughout with increased bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, which suggest likely developing infectious process possibly on a background of minimal pulmonary edema.
