A small to moderate size pneumothorax on the right is demonstrated, predominanly loculated along the base, with adjacent lung atelectasis. Lungs are hyperinflated with attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices compatible with mild emphysematous changes. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal without leftward shift of mediastinal structures. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is demonstrated. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
