In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube has been removed. Nasogastric tube extends to the lower body of the stomach, with the side port distal to the EG junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Again there is mild engorgement of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Small bilateral effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases, as well as obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
