One portable AP semi-upright view of the chest. Right internal jugular line ends in the distal SVC. ET tube is unchanged in position 6 cm above the carina. Enteric feeding tube ends off inferior to the border of this image. The retrocardiac opacity and patchy opacity within the mid and lower left lung are better seen on this study, with some associated volume loss in the left lung. Right lung is clear. No pneumothorax.
