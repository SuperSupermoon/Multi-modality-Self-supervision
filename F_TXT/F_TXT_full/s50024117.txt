Low lung volumes are present, which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is at least moderately enlarged. Aortic arch calcifications are present. Mild widening of the superior mediastinum is presumably due to low lung volumes. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema demonstrated. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
