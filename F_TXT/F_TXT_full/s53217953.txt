The endotracheal tube ends 3.2 cm above the level of the carina. A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid-to-low SVC, unchanged. An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm, curving superiorly to end in the gastric cardia. A Dobbhoff tube also passes below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly. An additional tube/wire projects over the right cervical region, possibly external to the patient, unchanged. Widespread bilateral interstitial opacities are minimally increased, particularly within the right mid lung. Bibasilar left greater than right heterogeneous opacities are likely atelectasis. There are no definite pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. The heart size is top normal, unchanged. The mediastinal contours are normal.
