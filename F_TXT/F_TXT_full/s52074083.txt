Comparison is made with prior study ___. ET tube is in the standard position. The tip is 5.5 cm above the carina. Right central catheter tip is in the right atrium. Moderate right effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. vascular congestion has improved, now is mild. Widened mediastinum has improved. Cardiomegaly is stable. Right lower hemithorax and perihilar consolidation with basal radiolucency is a combination of air and fluid in the pleural space and necrotizing PNA as better evaluated in concurrent CT
