Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Severe pulmonary edema is unchanged. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated, is obscured by the lung abnormalities. There is persistent small right basal pneumothorax despite the presence of a pigtail catheter. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position. Right lower lobe denser opacity consistent with a large area of atelectasis is unchanged.
