1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid superior vena cava. The Dobbhoff feeding tube now has its tip beneath the diaphragm likely positioned within the stomach. Part of the feeding tube appears to be coiled over the upper thorax/neck but this may be extrinsic to the patient. Clinical correlation is advised. 2. Persistent bibasilar airspace opacity with likely layering effusions, right greater than left, suggestive of compressive atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No evidence of pneumothorax.
