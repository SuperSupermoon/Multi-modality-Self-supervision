There has been interval placement of a right-sided central venous catheter with tip terminating in the distal SVC. No pneumothorax is seen. Redemonstration of focal opacity within the right lower lung is again noted and consistent with infection versus aspiration. The heart is normal in size. Aortic arch vascular calcifications are noted. Biapical pleural thickening is present. There is mild degenerative change about bilateral glenohumeral joints.
