Central venous catheter remains in standard position and a feeding tube continues to terminate in the proximal stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique. Lungs are overexpanded in keeping with known emphysema. Overall improved aeration in both lower lobes, with residual patchy infrahilar opacity on the right. A poorly defined opacity is also demonstrated within the lingula. There are no new areas of lung consolidation.
