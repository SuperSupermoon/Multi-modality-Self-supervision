Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate significant interval improvement in the right basilar pneumothorax. The left pleural effusion has increased in size since prior imaging. There is no change in the right basilar opacities. Cardiomegaly is mild and stable. A stent is seen which is likely in the SVC. There is a large femoral central line with the tip in the right atrium. A pigtail catheter is again seen in the right lung base.
