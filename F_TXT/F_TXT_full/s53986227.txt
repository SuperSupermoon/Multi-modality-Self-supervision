There has been recent median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery. Support and monitoring devices are similar in position except for slight change in position of the left chest tube. Interval marked improvement in previously present right upper lobe collapse with minor residual right upper lobe atelectasis remaining. Other multifocal predominantly linear areas of atelectasis are worse, particularly in the left retrocardiac area. Stable cardiomediastinal contours with persistent postoperative mediastinal widening. Clinical correlation and short-term radiographic are suggested to exclude mediastinal hematoma.
