Compared with the ___ film, there is similar opacification of the left mid and lower zones, with possible minimal interval progression. However, compared with ___ at 12:05 pm, there has been definite progression of the left-sided opacification. Two left-sided chest tubes are present. There is an irregular contour at the left lung apex with some pleural fluid and/or thickening -- the possibility of a subtle pneumothorax cannot be excluded, but no conventional lucency indicative of pneumothorax is detected. Cardiomegaly appears unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, but doubt other evidence of CHF. On the right, no frank consolidation or gross effusion. The small right effusion seen on ___ has resolved. Extensive diffuse sclerotic bone lesions, presumably metastases, are noted.
