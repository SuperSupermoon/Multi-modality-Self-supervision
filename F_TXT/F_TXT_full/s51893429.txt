Single AP portable upright view of the chest was obtained. The lung bases are underpenetrated. A dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads extending to the expected position of the right atrium and likely the right ventricle, although the very inferior aspect of the right ventricular lead is not fully included in the image. There are multiple overlying lead wires. A tubular structure/catheter is seen extending into the left lung apex which takes a sharp curve projecting over the lung apex. A possible residual small left apical pneumothorax is seen; however, consider followup with removal of external artifact. There are bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, which could be due to underlying infection/pneumonia and/or aspiration. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle raises concern for small left pleural effusion. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is not well assessed through the bibasilar opacities, most likely top normal. There are degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular joints.
