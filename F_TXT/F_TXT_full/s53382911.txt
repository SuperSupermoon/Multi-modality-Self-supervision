A PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava. The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration. The aortic arch is partly calcified. The lung volumes are low. There are patchy opacities at both lung bases, probably more extensive on the left; these could be seen with atelectasis, which was also visualized on recent prior CT imaging from ___ in association with pleural effusions. Subpulmonic pleural effusions may persist; at least on the left, a persistent effusion is implied by haziness in the left costophrenic sulcus.
