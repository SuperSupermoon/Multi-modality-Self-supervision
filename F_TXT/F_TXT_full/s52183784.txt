In comparison with study of ___, the opaque portion of the distal Dobbhoff tube lies just beyond the esophagogastric junction. The tube should be pushed forward if possible. Central lines remain in position. Opacifications at the right base most likely represent atelectatic change, though in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal or slightly enlarged. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
