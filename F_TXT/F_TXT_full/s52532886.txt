AP chest compared to ___. Veil-like opacification over the right hemithorax is probably largely pleural effusion, but it obscures the lungs and makes it impossible to exclude interstitial edema or even lower lobe atelectasis. On the left, the opacification at the bases is so severe that it is possible to diagnose likely collapsed, alternatively pneumonia. The left pleural effusion is small and left lung demonstrates mild edema. Mild cardiac enlargement is stable. Left subclavian line ends in the upper SVC. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
