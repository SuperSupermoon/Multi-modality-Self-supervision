Airspace opacity is seen overlying the right upper lung. There is also prominence of the hila and perihilar vessels bilaterally suggesting some pulmonary edema. There are low lung volumes. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle which could be due to a trace pleural effusion. Relatively linear opacity projecting over the lateral left mid to lower lung, is nonspecific. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is mild to moderately enlarged. The patient is rotated somewhat to the left.
