As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone wedge resection of pulmonary nodules. The post-surgical right-sided chest tube is in correct position. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. The appearance of the multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules is unchanged, with the exception of a small area at the lateral and basal aspects of the left lung, where the nodules appear to confluate, unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No pulmonary edema.
