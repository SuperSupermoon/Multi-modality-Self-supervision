Limited radiograph performed for assessment of nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube, excluding a significant portion of the right lung from the exam. Endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carinal, and nasogastric tube terminates in the proximal stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal, and imaged portions of the lungs are clear.
