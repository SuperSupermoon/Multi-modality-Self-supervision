Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance. In the absence of lateral view the amount of pleural effusion on the low left in particular is difficult to compare but most likely is unchanged since the prior study. The right PICC line tip is at the level of superior SVC. No new consolidations demonstrated. No pneumothorax is seen. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema, in fact there is even minimal improvement of the vascular enlargement as compared to previous study
