A right subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the proximal right atrium. The tip of the chest tube is situated at the apex. There is post residual subcutaneous emphysema. The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned at 4.2 cm above the carina. Known large right pneumothorax is difficult to appreciate on this exam. The left chest is clear although the left lung apex is not included in the field of view. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. There is no pleural effusion. Included upper abdomen is notable for excreted contrast in the kidneys.
