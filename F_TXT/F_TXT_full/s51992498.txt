Right-sided PICC is seen terminating in the low SVC, without evidence of pneumothorax. Left costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image and thus small pleural effusion is not excluded. No definite focal consolidation is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
