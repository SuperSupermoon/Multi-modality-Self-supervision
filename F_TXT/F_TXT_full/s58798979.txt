Heart size and mediastinum are stable. There is a left intra hilar opacity, new as compared to the previous study and potentially might represent developing infectious process. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Attention to this area is recommended and preferably PA and lateral radiographs of the chest would be beneficial for pre size characterization.
