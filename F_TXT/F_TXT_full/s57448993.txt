AP chest compared to ___: Severe pulmonary consolidation which worsened between ___ and ___ has not improved, and may have worsened. Right pigtail pleural drainage catheter unchanged in position. Left jugular line ends in the SVC, ET tube in standard placement and upper enteric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. It is impossible to assess heart size and volume of pleural effusions given the severity of pulmonary consolidation. A tiny right apical pneumothorax is probably related to the continuing pleural drainage, but unchanged.
