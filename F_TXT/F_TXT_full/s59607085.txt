A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates thoracic spinal hardware and sternal wires. Lung volumes are low with increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Even allowing for this, there is cardiomegaly. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged, as is retrocardiac opacity. Increased opacity in the right lower lung is new. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
