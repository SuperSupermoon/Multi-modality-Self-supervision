As compared to the previous radiograph, it appears as if the endotracheal tube has been pulled back. The tip of the tube is now approximately 3 cm above the carina. The Dobbhoff catheter shows a normal course and is correctly positioned in the middle parts of the stomach. The two right-sided central venous access lines are in correct position. The retrocardiac atelectasis and the right mediobasal opacity are constant. No pneumothorax. No larger pleural effusions.
