Again is seen a right-sided central venous catheter with its tip in the upper portion of the right atrium. The patient is slightly rotated to the left. The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. The lungs are clear, although there is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, likely exaggerated by patient positioning. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Opacity of the visualized abdomen suggests ascites.
