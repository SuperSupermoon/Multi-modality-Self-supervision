The patient is rotated to the left. There are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Patchy left basilar opacity could be due to atelectasis versus aspiration versus infection. No large pleural effusion is seen although trace pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude given the low lung volumes. No evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
