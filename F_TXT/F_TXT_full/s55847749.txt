AP chest compared to ___, 2:31 a.m.: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions have increased substantially, probably responsible for increasing bibasilar atelectasis, less likely pneumonia, but the process, which ever is the case, has progressed substantially over the past 24 hours. Heart is mildly enlarged. Upper lungs show mild vascular congestion, as expected given the poor aeration at the bases, but no pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax.
