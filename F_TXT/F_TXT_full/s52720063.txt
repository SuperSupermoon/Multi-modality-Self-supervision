Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is a right IJ central line tip over distal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen is cardiomegaly with sternotomy wires, similar to prior, allowing for differences in positioning. Platelike atelectasis the left upper zone, increased retrocardiac density, possible small left effusion are again seen. Upper zone redistribution with vascular plethora and vascular blurring suggestive of CHF again noted.
