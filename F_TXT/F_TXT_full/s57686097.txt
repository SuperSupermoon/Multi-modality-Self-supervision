Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given marked patient rotation status post median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement. There are layering effusions, right greater than left, with associated patchy opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Perihilar vascular engorgement remains present, but there is no overt pulmonary edema. Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. A nasogastric tube is seen with its tip projecting over the stomach. A right PICC line and is unchanged in position. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
