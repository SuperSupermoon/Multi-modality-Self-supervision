Left upper lobe lung mass and left apical opacities are again noted, better characterized in prior CT. There are retrocardiac left lower lobe atelectasis. Multiple lung nodules in the right lung are better seen in prior CT. There is no pleural effusion. Mediastinal silhouette is unchanged, widened due to the presence of lymph nodes.
