As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a decrease in lung volume, and subsequently, an increase in overall lung density. The severity of the pre-existing opacities, should not have substantially changed in the interval. Lung volumes remain low. Moderate cardiomegaly, no evidence of pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
