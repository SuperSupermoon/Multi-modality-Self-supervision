Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are unchanged. Due to positioning, the effusions are layered posteriorly. The previously seen opacification in the right mid lung is obscured by the layered effusion. There is no new consolidation or pneumothorax. The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal. Calcification of the aortic arch and descending aorta are again noted.
