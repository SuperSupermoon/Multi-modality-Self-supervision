Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. Evaluation is limited given low lung volumes. Overlying EKG leads are also present which slightly limit the evaluation. There are ground-glass poorly defined opacities involving the lower lungs bilaterally, slightly more prominent on the left than right. This appearance may be related to pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The heart size appears top normal. Aorta is unfolded with atherosclerotic calcifications. Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted. The imaged osseous structures appear intact.
