As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared right pleural effusion, leading to obliteration of the right costophrenic sinus. There is unchanged evidence of moderate pulmonary edema but on the left another pleural effusion has newly occurred and causes relatively massive atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung areas. In the well-ventilated lungs there is no evidence of pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
