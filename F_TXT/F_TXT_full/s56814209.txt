Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes and the patient is likely kyphotic in position. Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Prominence of the right hilar/perihilar region is grossly stable since ___ to possibly slightly increased given differences in patient positioning. There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature consistent with pulmonary vascular engorgement with possible mild edema. No large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The cardiac is top normal to possibly mildly enlarged. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.
