There is no change in the cardiomegaly and central pulmonary vascular congestion but there appears to be less interstitial prominence likely reflecting resolution of interstitial edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions seen on recent CT are not well appreciated on this study. Left pulse generator with electrodes within the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus is in expected and unaltered position. Mitral and tricuspid valve replacements are again noted. Sternal wires are intact.
