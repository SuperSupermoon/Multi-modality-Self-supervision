There is dense opacity in the left lung base which could be due to combination of large left pleural effusion and left lower lobe volume loss. Superimposed pneumonia is also possible. Cardiac silhouette is obscured by large left pleural effusion, however probably moderately enlarged. Faint opacity at the right lung base is likely atelectasis. Left pectoral pacemaker with 2 leads terminating in right ventricle and right atrium are in unchanged position.
