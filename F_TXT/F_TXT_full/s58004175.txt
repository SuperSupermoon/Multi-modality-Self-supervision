AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The heart size is difficult to assess since the right cardiac border is obscured by substantial pleural effusion and atelectasis, unchanged since the prior study. Left pleural effusion and atelectasis are re-demonstrated as well. Minimal bronchiectasis are noted in the left lower lobe. There is no pneumothorax. Given the relatively sharp angle of the PICC line between the assumed course of the subclavian vein and brachiocephalic vein, it potentially may be located outside of the vascular structure. Correlation with lateral view is recommended.
