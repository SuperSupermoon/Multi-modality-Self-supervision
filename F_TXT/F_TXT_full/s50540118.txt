Perihilar consolidation both upper lungs is improving, but right basal consolidation has been relatively stable over the past 48 hours. Asymmetric edema is of possible explanation, but I am still more concerned about pneumonia Heart size is normal. ET tube tip is at the thoracic inlet. Right jugular line ends in the right atrium. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusions if present are not large.
