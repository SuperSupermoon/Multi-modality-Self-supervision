A left pectoral pacemaker is in place. The chin and overlying soft tissues partially obscures lung apices. There is no obvious pneumothorax. Aside from minimal left basilar subsegmental atelectasis, the lungs are clear. A rounded left infrahilar contour is new, and may be due to left hilar adenopathy, an enlarged left atrium, or a new descending aortic aneurysm. A small left pleural effusion and left basilar subsegmental atelectasis have decreased.
