AP portable upright view of the chest. Overlying EKG leads are present. Lung volumes are low limiting assessment. Allowing for low lung volumes, there is no convincing evidence for pneumonia or edema. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Mild prominence of the hilar structures likely reflect bronchovascular crowding in the setting of low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. Bony structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
