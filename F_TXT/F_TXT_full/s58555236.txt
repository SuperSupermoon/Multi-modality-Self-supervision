The patient is status post endotracheal intubation. The tube is somewhat low lying, with the tip terminating only about 1-1.5 cm above the carina. In addition, the balloon appears somewhat over-inflated. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach although with relatively little purchase. Its sidehole lies only slightly below the gastroesophageal junction. There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device in place. The heart is at upper limits of normal size. The aorta shows mild-to-moderate unfolding and patchy calcification. Otherwise, the mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is a retrocardiac opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm which could be seen with substantial atelectasis, perhaps with a pleural effusion; however, infectious causes are difficult to exclude.
