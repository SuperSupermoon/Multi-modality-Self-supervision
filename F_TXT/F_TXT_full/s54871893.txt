Mild interval improvement in the pulmonary edema. Endotracheal tube in situ with the tip 84 mm proximal to the carina. Increased bibasal densities appear similar compared to previous imaging and most likely represent bibasal atelectasis with small associated effusions. No new airspace consolidation.
