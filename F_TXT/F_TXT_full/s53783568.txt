In comparison to the prior exam, the right lung masses have increased in size. For example, the central superior mass previously measured 5.1 cm. It now measures 6.6 cm. A large mass at the right base is also increased in size. It previously measured 7.1 cm and now measures ___.8 cm. A third mass in the right mid lung zone appears stable. The left lung is essentially clear. There is no left pleural effusion. A right pleural effusion cannot be assessed for due to the large mass. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and normal.
