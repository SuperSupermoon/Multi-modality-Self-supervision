Compared with ___ at 08:23, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is the ET tube, tip approximately 4.4 cm above the carina an NG tube the tip extending beneath diaphragm, now extending off the film. A side-port probably lies immediately distal to the GE junction. No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is detected. Mild scarring at both lung bases is again noted.
