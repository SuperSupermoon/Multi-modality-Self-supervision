Moderate-to-severe chronic cardiomegaly is unchanged. The lung volumes are extremely low resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular markings. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present, with improvement in the previously seen pulmonary edema. No consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen in this study.
