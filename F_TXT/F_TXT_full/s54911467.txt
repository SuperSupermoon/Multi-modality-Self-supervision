When compared to the prior study, there is no apparent interval change. There are layering bilateral effusions, right greater than left, with airspace disease in most of the right lung and in the retrocardiac region. Although these findings may represent atelectasis, pneumonia should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube, left internal jugular central line, left subclavian PICC line and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. Heart remains stably enlarged.
