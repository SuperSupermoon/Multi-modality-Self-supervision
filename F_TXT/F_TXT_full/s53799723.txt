Diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has progressed substantially and asymmetrically since ___. The changes between ___ suggest pulmonary edema. Subsequently much more consolidation has developed in the right lung apex and perihilar left lung. I would attribute that pulmonary contusion and hemorrhage only if the patient has developed a bleeding diathesis, because there was little if any contusion on the initial chest CT ___. For example if the patient is thrombocytopenic from multiple transfusions, minimal early contusions can bleed more heavily after an initial delay. I would suggest instead bilateral pneumonia in the setting of continued pulmonary edema. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions increased since ___, are stable since ___. The heart is only mildly enlarged but mediastinal veins are still dilated. ET tube is in standard placement. Nasogastric tube ends in the region of the pylorus. Stomach is not distended. Right jugular introducer ends at the origin of the SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
