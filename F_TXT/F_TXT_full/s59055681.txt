Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. With this limitation in mind, heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. No focal areas of consolidation are identified within the lungs. If clinical suspicion for acute infection persists, standard PA and lateral chest radiographs with improved inspiratory effort may be helpful to more fully evaluate the lung bases.
