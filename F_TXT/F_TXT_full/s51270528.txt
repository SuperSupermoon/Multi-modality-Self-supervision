Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right central venous line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Cardiomegaly is substantial. Mediastinum is unremarkable. Mild interstitial opacities, unchanged since the prior study, are redemonstrated. Note is made that the radiograph is slightly lordotic and may accentuate the cardiac silhouette as well as the position of the PICC line, but it is most likely still above the cavoatrial junction. No substantial pleural effusion demonstrated. Attention to the right mid and lower lobe opacities is important since they potentially might reflect infectious process. Alternatively, the assessment after diuresis is recommended.
