Enteric and ET tubes are no longer visualized. Degree of pulmonary edema perhaps minimally less extensive when compared to prior. Cardiomegaly is again seen. Retrocardiac region is not well-visualized potentially in part due to overlying soft tissues and atelectasis although underlying infection cannot be excluded.
