The patient has been extubated and the orogastric tube has been removed. Right IJ central line again extends to the mid SVC. Widespread pulmonary opacities appear slightly more confluent at the right lung base, though there is slightly improved aeration in the retrocardiac region. The appearance at the right base may reflect atelectasis in the setting of extubation. Presumed effusions are again not readily apparent. There is no pneumothorax. Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no free air in the upper abdomen.
