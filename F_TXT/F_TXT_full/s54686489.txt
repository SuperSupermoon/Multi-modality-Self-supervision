Single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. Left internal jugular approach central venous catheter is now appropriately positioned with the tip terminating in the mid SVC. Right subclavian approach dialysis catheter tip terminates in the right atrium. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen in the current study. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable moting mitral annular calcifications.
