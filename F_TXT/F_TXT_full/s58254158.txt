When compared to the most recent prior, there is no significant interval change in the left hemithorax which likely reflects a combination of a known left lung mass with collapse of the left lower lobe and/or pleural collection when correlated with the recent chest CT of ___. The left chest tube remains unchanged in position and a left subclavian PICC line is again seen. Right lung remains well inflated and clear. No large pneumothorax is seen, although there are a few vertical linear lucencies along the lateral edge of the left lung which could represent loculated air within the pleural space at seen on the CT ___. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely reflect a small effusion. No pulmonary edema. Overall, no significant change.
