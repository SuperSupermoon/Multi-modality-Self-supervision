Moderate right pleural effusion has developed new loculations since earlier in the day, raising concern for active inflammation or bleeding. Greater opacification in the right lower lobe could be due to atelectasis or increasing effusion but raises concern for pneumonia. Possibility of acute pulmonary embolus should be considered clinically. Left lung clear. Small pleural drainage catheter in place. Tiny left apical pneumothorax and pleural effusion are unchanged. Heart size top-normal, unchanged. Mediastinal widening in the right lower paratracheal station which developed on ___ is still present. This could be due to a distended esophagus or alternatively dilated mediastinal veins because of volume overload, acute large pulmonary emboli, or cardiac tamponade.
