Moderate left pleural effusion persists. Mild pulmonary edema has worsened. Heart size is normal mediastinal veins are not distended. Tip of the tracheostomy tube abuts the left tracheal wall, as it has occasionally in the past and should be evaluated to see if positioning is appropriate. Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax. A skin fold in the right upper chest should not be mistaken for the pleural edge.
