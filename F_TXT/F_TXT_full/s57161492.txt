AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. The patient has now been extubated and the previously identified ETT is not seen anymore. Also, a previous detectable NG tube has been withdrawn. Left-sided local pleural thickening along the axillary and lateral chest wall remains rather unchanged. The same holds for the multiple left-sided rib fractures which, however, cannot be identified in detail. The subcutaneous chest wall emphysema has diminished, but remains visible in the left-sided lower neck area. No other new pulmonary abnormalities are seen. Moderate cardiac enlargement similar as before.
