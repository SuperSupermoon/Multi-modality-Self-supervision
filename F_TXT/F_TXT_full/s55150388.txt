There is increased blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally with meniscal configuration, concerning for bilateral pleural effusions. The aerated upper lungs demonstrate prominent pulmonary vasculature without evidence for edema. Large hiatal hernia is again seen with adjacent compressive atelectasis. There are increased basilar consolidations, likely atelectasis in the setting of effusion. However, pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. The cardiac silhouette is obscured and therefore heart size is incompletely evaluated on this study. No pneumothorax is detected. Right glenohumeral degenerative changes noted.
