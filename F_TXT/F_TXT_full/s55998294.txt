1. Persistent low lung volumes with layering right effusion and patchy opacity at the right base most likely representing compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is challenging given patient rotation on the current examination. There is prominence of the ascending aorta, which could just reflect an unfolded tortuous aorta, but raises the possibility of an ascending aortic aneurysm. Correlation with the patient's more remote chest films would be advised. Lung volumes remain low with crowding of the vasculature and no evidence of pulmonary edema. The left lung is grossly clear. No pneumothorax.
