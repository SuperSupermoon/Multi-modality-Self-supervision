AP chest compared to ___, read in conjunction with a chest CT ___: Original component of right suprahilar pneumonia (for which there was no precursor lesion in ___) is no worse, but there is new opacification at the periphery of the right mid lung which could be worsening pneumonia. Conventional radiographs would be helpful in excluding a component of overlying soft tissue. Vascular clips suggest extensive bilateral anterior chest wall surgery. An increase in both cardiac diameter and size of the at least moderate to large hiatus hernia could be due to supine and AP positioning, but there is new mediastinal vascular engorgement suggesting increased intravascular volume or pressure. Left lung is clear. There is neither appreciable pleural effusion, nor evidence of pneumothorax.
