ET tube tip 5.6 cm above the carina. NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm, off film, again seen looping in the stomach. Right central line tip overlies mid/ distal SVC. Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip again overlies the main pulmonary artery. Left-sided battery pack again noted. There is a lead extending cephalad. Note is made that is difficult to trace the lead on the available images. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Again seen is patchy retrocardiac opacity and minimal patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, similar to prior. No gross effusion. Doubt CHF.
