Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate ET tube in place with the tip 5.3 cm above the carina. Low lung volumes are seen, likely secondary to poor inspiration. Left lower lobe atelectasis is seen with some elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
