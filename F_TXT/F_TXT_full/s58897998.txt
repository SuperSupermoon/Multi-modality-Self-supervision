As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of a post-surgical status in the left lung, with substantial soft tissue structures above and below the left apical suture line. The lung volumes continue to be low, with mild atelectatic changes at both lung bases, right more than left, and a normal-sized cardiac silhouette. There is no clear evidence of a newly appeared parenchymal opacity. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
