The patient is status post median sternotomy and tricuspid valve surgery. Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 6 cm above the carina and could be advanced slightly for standard positioning. Multifocal bilateral pulmonary opacities are again demonstrated, some of them with cystic or cavitary components. These findings are consistent with known septic emboli. Additional multifocal areas of consolidation are evident and have slightly worsened in the interval, particularly in the left lung base, and are concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Small to moderate left pleural effusion has slightly increased in size, and a small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
