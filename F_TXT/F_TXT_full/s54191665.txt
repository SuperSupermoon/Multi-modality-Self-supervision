In comparison to the prior radiograph performed 3 hours earlier, there has been interval development of new bilateral parenchymal opacities, either rapidly developing pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. Trace left pleural effusion is not well visualized on the current study. A 1 cm calcified nodule projects over the right heart border. Heart size remains moderately enlarged. Newly placed endotracheal tube terminates 7.2 cm above the carina. The tip of the enteric tube is within the mid-esophagus and should also be advanced.
