The exam is suboptimal as the superior chest and the inferolateral right chest are not fully included on the image. The patient is also rotated to the left. The right IJ line is again seen terminating in the low SVC. There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube not optimally seen, but likely terminating approximately 4.9 cm above the level the carina. An orogastric tube has also been placed in the interval, coursing below the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. Again, there are extensive right perihilar opacities which may be due to infection, but component of assymetric edema is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen.
