The lungs are relatively hyperinflated. Linear left base atelectasis/scarring is seen. There is also a relative linear opacity projecting over the lateral right upper lung which may be due to scarring, however, this could be further assessed on dedicated chest CT. There is no pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragm.
