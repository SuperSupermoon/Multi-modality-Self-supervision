AP semi-upright portable chest x-ray was provided. Similar to the prior exam, there is a moderate-to-large right-sided pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. There has been interval improvement in the left pulmonary opacities. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable from the prior study. There is no pneumothorax.
