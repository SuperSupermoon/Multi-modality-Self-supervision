A right-sided PICC line terminates in the lower superior vena cava. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. The lungs appear clear. Although the left costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded, it appears effaced, so a trace pleural effusion is possible on that side. Metallic biliary stents project over the left upper quadrant.
