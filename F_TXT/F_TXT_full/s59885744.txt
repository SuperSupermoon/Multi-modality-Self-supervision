AP view of the chest. There are bilateral patchy and interstitial opacities, mainly central and basilar in location. This is most consistent with pulmonary edema. There is at least mild cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax. Likely small bilateral pleural effusions. There is a retrocardiac opacity of which pneumonia cannot be definitely ruled out.
