A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged in position, with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. There is no evidence for lead fracture. A stent within the region of the right subclavian vein is unchanged. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are constant. The heart is moderately enlarged but unchanged. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema. The lungs are slightly hyperinflated. Bibasilar opacities, particularly at the right lung base, are likely reflective of atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema noted.
