There are several focal pulmonary abnormalities which are difficult to characterize. For example, there is bronchial wall thickening in the right mid lung zone and a linear opacity in the left lower lung zone. There is no pulmonary edema, consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
