Semi-upright portable chest radiograph was obtained demonstrating new left subclavian catheter terminating in the upper SVC without pneumothorax. Left IJ catheter has been withdrawn to the left brachiocephalic vein. Nasogastric tube terminates in the proximal stomach with Dobbhoff tube coursing into the stomach and out of view. Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position. Moderate left greater than right bilateral pleural effusions are similar in appearance to the recent CT, with accompanying atelectasis and mild pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
