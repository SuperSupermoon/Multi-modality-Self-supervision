In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a right pigtail catheter with some apparent decrease in opacification in the left hemithorax. Nevertheless, there is opacification adjacent to the right rib cage on the current study consistent with pleural fluid, some of which could be loculated. Some displacement of the upper thoracic trachea to the right is again noted. There is indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Poor definition of the right heart border could reflect substantial volume loss in the lower lung.
