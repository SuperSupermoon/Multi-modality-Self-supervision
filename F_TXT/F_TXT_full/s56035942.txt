Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most recently 12:57 today. This radiograph was taken following bronchoscopic extraction of bronchial secretions, and placement of an ET tube in standard position. Right middle lobe is partially aerated, but there is still complete collapse of the upper and lower lobes. Downward bulging of the minor fissure suggests either bleeding in the upper lobe or mid fissural pleural collection. Solitary pigtail pleural drainage catheter is still in place. There is no pneumothorax. Left lung shows expected vascular congestion but is otherwise clear. Heart is unchanged, moderately enlarged. Pulmonary arteries are chronically enlarged. Right PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
