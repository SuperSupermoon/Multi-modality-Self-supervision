The patient is intubated, with tip of endotracheal tube terminating 2.5 cm above the carina with the neck in a flexed position. Nasogastric tube coils in the esophagus with distal tip directed cephalad in the region of the cervicothoracic junction. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Focal atelectasis in the right upper lobe is new, as well as a nonspecific left lower lobe opacity which could reflect atelectasis, it is aspiration, or infection, with associated small left pleural effusion.
