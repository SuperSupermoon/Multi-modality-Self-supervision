Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip 3 cm above the carina. The right hemodialysis catheter is unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably widened. Lung volumes remain low with patchy bibasilar opacities and patchy peripheral linear opacities in the right upper lung favoring atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No overt pulmonary edema. No large effusions.
