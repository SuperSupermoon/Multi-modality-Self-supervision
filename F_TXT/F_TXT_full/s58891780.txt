AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 6:05 a.m.: Over the course of the day a mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion have improved, mediastinal venous engorgement has not, but this could be a function of supine positioning. I see no appreciable pneumothorax. Pleural effusion if any is minimal. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements respectively and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. No pneumothorax.
