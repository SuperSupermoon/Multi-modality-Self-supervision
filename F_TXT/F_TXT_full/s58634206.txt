The small tracheostomy tube is midline but may have a very short intra tracheal excursion. A lateral view is necessary for that determination. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic but pulmonary vascular congestion has improved since earlier in the day. Peribronchial opacification in the right lung base could be atelectasis caused by the chronically and severely elevated right hemidiaphragm or could be early pneumonia. Left PIC line ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusions are small if any.
