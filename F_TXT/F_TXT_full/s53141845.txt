As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. As a consequence, there is increased crowding of the vascular and bronchial structures. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. Status post aortic stent graft and right pectoral Port-A-Cath. Known opacities at both lung bases and at the bases of the right upper lobe. Mild fluid overload. No larger pleural effusions.
