AP chest compared to ___ and ___: New left pleural tube ends at the apex of the hemithorax. Pneumothorax is tiny. There is at least a small left pleural effusion. Opacification at the base of the left chest is probably a combination of pleural effusion and new left lower lobe atelectasis. Lung volumes are generally lower, and there may be early pulmonary edema. Large cardiac silhouette is slightly smaller, given the AP projection and lower lung volumes compared to the size on ___ conventional chest radiographs. There is a suggestion of a small amount of air in the pericardium, which would not be surprising given the recent surgery. It shows thickening of the pericardium lateral to the right atrium.
