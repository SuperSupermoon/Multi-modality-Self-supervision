A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates widening of the right mediastinum, patchy right lung opacities with more dense consolidation of the right lower lung, as well as right pleural effusion and irregular thickening of the pleura, concerning for complex complications of a known right lung malignancy. The left lung is clear. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate given right lower lung dense consolidation, but appears to be normal in size, shifted to the left. There is no pleural effusion on the left. No pneumothorax is present. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
