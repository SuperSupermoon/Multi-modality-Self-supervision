Assessment is slightly limited due to patient rotation. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. Bilateral hilar enlargement may suggest underlying lymphadenopathy of pulmonary arterial enlargement. Right pleural thickening or fluid is seen along the minor fissure. Streaky opacity in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis. No right pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified, and the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. No displaced fractures are identified. There is marked gaseous distention of the stomach.
