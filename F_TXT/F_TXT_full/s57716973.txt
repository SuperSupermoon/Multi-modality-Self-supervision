As compared to the previous radiograph, there is substantially improved ventilation of the lungs, notably on the right. The size of the cardiac silhouette is still moderately-severely enlarged. The leads, as far as it is possible to judge on one projection image, are projecting over the right atrium and the right ventricle. The generator is in pectoral position. Mild fluid overload. Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small left pleural effusion.
