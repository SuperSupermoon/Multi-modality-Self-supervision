AP chest compared to ___: A previous right basal consolidation continues to clear, consistent with a rapidly resolving pneumonia. Mild edema present on ___ and accompanying pulmonary vascular engorgement have both cleared. Tiny bilateral pleural effusions remain, and the heart is still at least moderately enlarged, but smaller than it was on ___. ET tube in standard placement. Upper enteric drainage tube barely reaches the stomach which I cannot assess for size, and the tube should be advanced at least 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Left PICC line ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax.
