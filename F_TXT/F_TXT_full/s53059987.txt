Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position except for a right PICC, terminating in the right subclavian vein just beyond the right axillary vein. This is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Multifocal areas of poorly defined consolidation are again demonstrated, with slight worsening in the left lower lung. Numerous cavitary and cystic lesions are present bilaterally in keeping with history of septic emboli. Bilateral pleural effusions appear unchanged, small on the right and moderate on the left.
