AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided. Loculated right pleural effusion is again seen, with compressive lower lobe atelectasis unchanged. There is right perihilar opacity which likely reflects known fibrosis as seen on prior CT. New consolidation is seen. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Bony structures are intact.
