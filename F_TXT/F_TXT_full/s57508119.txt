AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging: There is a large mass involving the mid and lower pole regions of the left hilus. Obscuration of the left heart border suggests involvement over atelectasis in the lingula. Remainder of the left upper lobe is well aerated. Right lung is clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contour suggests adenopathy involving at least the left lower paratracheal station and either the right lower paratracheal or prevascular stations.
