A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. The imaged field of view excludes the inferior right costophrenic angle. Lung volumes are low. A right basilar opacity is insufficiently assessed. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. The epicardial and dual-chamber intracardiac pacing leads are in stable position. The upper 2 sternal wire remain fractured. The tip of a right-sided tunneled central catheter terminates in the right atrium.
