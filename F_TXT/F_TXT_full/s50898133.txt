CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 17:45 p.m., a small right pneumothorax is again seen, possibly very slightly smaller. There is a small right pleural effusion, probably slightly larger. There is also increased opacity at the right base, likely reflecting collapse and/or consolidation. The left lung, left effusion, and left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation are grossly unchanged, possibly slightly worse. Right-sided chest tube and an additional right lung base tube or catheter again noted.
