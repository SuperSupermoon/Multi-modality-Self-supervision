Lung volumes are low. Extensive bilateral opacities are unchanged from the prior examination and likely reflect the patient underlying severe interstitial lung disease. There is possibly increased opacification of the right lower lung, which may represent mild edema. Hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Calcification of the aortic arch is noted. There is no pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion.
