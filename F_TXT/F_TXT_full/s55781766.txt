There has been interval decrease in left base opacity, interval decrease in left pleural effusion, which appears essentially resolved. No pneumothorax is seen. Large hiatal hernia is re- demonstrated. Patient is rotated somewhat to the right. There has been interval increase in right mid to lower lung opacities which may in part relate to differences in patient positioning, however, there is concern for increasing right-sided pleural effusions. Known subcarinal and right hilar masses better assessed on CT.
