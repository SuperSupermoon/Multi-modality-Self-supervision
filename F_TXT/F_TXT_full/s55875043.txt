In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there are low lung volumes that accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural fluid and underlying compressive atelectasis of the left lower lung. PICC line again extends to about the level of the cavoatrial junction.
