Single portable AP radiograph demonstrates no focal opacity convincing for pneumonia. Bilateral hila appear prominent, possibly reflective of pulmonary vessels though adenopathy cannot be excluded. Heart is normal in size. Mediastinal contour is otherwise unremarkable. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures are without an acute abnormality. No air under the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
