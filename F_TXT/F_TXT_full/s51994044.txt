Permanent pacemaker remains in place with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. New patchy and linear opacities have developed in the right mid and both lower lungs, with appearance favoring atelectasis. Multifocal aspiration is an additional consideration, and followup radiographs may also be helpful to exclude the less likely possibility of developing infectious pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion is also new.
