As compared to previous radiograph of earlier the same date, tip of intra-aortic balloon pump remains relatively low, terminating 6 cm below the carina. Tip of endotracheal tube is also low, currently terminates of within 1.5 cm of the carina. Pulmonary edema has substantially improved compared to the preoperative radiograph. Right pleural effusion is no longer evident. Hyperlucency along the right hemidiaphragm contour could be projectional or may reflect a small basilar pneumothorax with indwelling chest tube.
