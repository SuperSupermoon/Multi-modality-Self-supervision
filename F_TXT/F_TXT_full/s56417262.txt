AP chest compared to ___: Very small right apical pneumothorax is smaller today than on ___, and there is no appreciable right pleural effusion. Hazy opacification at the apex of the postoperative right lung is new, could be atelectasis, but should be evaluated clinically for possible developing pneumonia. Mild pulmonary edema, worse in the postoperative right lung, has improved since ___. A band like opacity, crossing the elevated right hilus obliquely has been stable postoperatively, but its identity is unclear to me. If the patient had an intercostal buttress applied to the bronchial stump, we could be seeing that. Heart is top normal size. The right pleural drain is unchanged in position looped over the apex of the right lung.
