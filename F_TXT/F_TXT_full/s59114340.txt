As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. Right internal jugular vein catheter and the nasogastric tube are unchanged. Lung volumes have slightly decreased. The extent of the pre-existing left pleural effusion as well as the accompanying atelectasis and the subtle opacities at the right lung bases are minimally more pronounced than on the previous image. No other changes. No pneumothorax.
