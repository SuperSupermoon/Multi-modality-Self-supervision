Lung volumes are lower than on the prior study. Two catheters project over the right hemithorax. Right pleural fluid or thickening is unchanged but right lower lung opacity has slightly increased, which may be due to atelectasis or pleurodesis mediated edema. If there is still a right pneumothorax, it is smaller. The right hilar mass is again noted. Aside from left basilar atelectasis, the left lung is clear and the prior interpretation of left lung nodules is not tenable.
