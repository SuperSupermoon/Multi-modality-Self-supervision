Left subclavian central venous catheter is seen terminating in the region of the mid SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. Prominence of the right hilum may relate to underlying vascular congestion, but correlate with blood return from the central catheter to exclude arterial puncture. No large pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified.
