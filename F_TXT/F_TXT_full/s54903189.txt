As compared to previous radiograph from 1 day earlier, right pleural catheter remains in place, with no substantial pleural effusion. Unusual sharpness of right hemidiaphragm could reflect a basilar pneumothorax. Moderate to large layering left pleural effusion has apparently increased in size, although positional differences of the studies limit comparison. No other relevant change.
