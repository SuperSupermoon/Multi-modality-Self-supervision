Single portable view of the chest. Relatively lower lung volumes are seen when compared to prior. Calcific density again projects over the lateral aspect of the right mid lung. A left PICC is seen with tip projecting over the distal brachiocephalic vein/upper SVC. Given positioning, the lungs are grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
