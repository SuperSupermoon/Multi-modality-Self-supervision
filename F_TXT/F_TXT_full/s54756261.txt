In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring support devices are unchanged. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications have increased, suggesting significant pulmonary edema. Left hemidiaphragm is not well seen, most likely related to pleural fluid and volume loss in left lower lobe. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could not be excluded.
