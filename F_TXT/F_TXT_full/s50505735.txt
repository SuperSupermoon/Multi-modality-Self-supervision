The cardiac silhouette is mild to moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Overlying the posterior lateral left seventh rib, there is a subtle rounded opacity measuring approximately 6 mm, unclear whether artifactual, osseous, or possibly pulmonary nodule. This could be further assessed on nonurgent chest CT. No further consolidation is seen.
