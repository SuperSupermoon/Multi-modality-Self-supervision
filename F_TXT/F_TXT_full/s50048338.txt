In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged, except for placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the stomach with the side hole at the level of the esophagogastric junction and a right IJ catheter with its tip in the mid SVC with no evidence of pneumothorax. Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
