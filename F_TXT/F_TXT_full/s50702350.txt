Mild pulmonary edema is present in the left lower lung, improved since ___. More severe interstitial abnormality in the right lung and basal consolidation persist. There is also suggestion of right hilar adenopathy. I strongly doubt that this is simply asymmetric edema. Chest CT scanning recommended. Moderate cardiomegaly.
