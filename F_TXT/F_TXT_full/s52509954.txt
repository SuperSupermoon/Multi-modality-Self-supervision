As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The lung volumes are slightly increased, potentially reflecting improved inspiratory effort. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Likely presence of pleural calcifications. Minimal bilateral fibrotic changes at the lung bases and at the level of the right lung apex. No overt pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions.
