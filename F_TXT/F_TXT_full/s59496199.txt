Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged, increased compared to the prior study. The mediastinal contour is similar. Left PICC tip terminates in the upper SVC. There is mild pulmonary edema, new in the interval, with new layering small to moderate size bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
