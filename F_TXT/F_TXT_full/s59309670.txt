AP chest compared to ___, 5:17 p.m.: Because this study is performed with the patient supine, assessing the volume of pleural air and fluid compared to preceding upright radiograph is dubious. Pleural effusions are small to moderate, and left pneumothorax is also small. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable. Mild pulmonary edema may have increased slightly.
