Subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the visualized portion of the lower left neck. There is a small focus of lucency at the extreme upper apex of the left lung. This could be due to some overlying subcutaneous emphysema. A tiny left apical pneumothorax is considered less likely, but is not entirely excluded. In addition, there is equivocal minimal air to the left of the trachea, adjacent the left lung apex --___ real, this could represent a very small amount of pneumomediastinum. Elsewhere, no evidence of pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, or pneumothorax. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise within normal limits. No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion detected.
