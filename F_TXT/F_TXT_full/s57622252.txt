As compared to the previous image, the left chest tube has been replaced. The tip of the tube now reaches the left lung apex. The left lung continues to be reasonably well expanded, although a minimal left basal pneumothorax cannot be excluded. Unchanged position of the other monitoring and support devices. No evidence of tension.
