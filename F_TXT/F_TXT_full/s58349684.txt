AP chest compared to ___: Large left pleural effusion which increased substantially between ___ and ___ is now much smaller. I do not see any new drainage catheters, but some of those devices are barely visible radiographically. Small areas of consolidation in the right lung are still present. Left lung was largely edematous and atelectatic earlier in the week before the pleural effusion increased prior to its subsequent drainage. Lung findings are really indistinguishable regarding edema, pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. Heart size is still largely obscured by left pleural abnormality. No pneumothorax. Left upper pleural drain still in place. Left PICC line ends at the origin of the SVC.
