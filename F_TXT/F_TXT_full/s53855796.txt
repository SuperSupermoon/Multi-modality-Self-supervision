Since the prior study, there has been significant interval increase in bilateral perihilar and mid to lower lung opacities worrisome for moderate to severe pulmonary edema with possible increase in bilateral pleural effusions and overlying atelectasis. Bibasilar opacities likely represent combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, however, in the appropriate clinical setting underlying consolidation due to infection or aspiration not excluded. Cardiac silhouette is difficult to actually assessed due to the adjacent basilar opacities.
