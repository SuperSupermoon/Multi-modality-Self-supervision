A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained. Lung volumes are low. There is dense retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the medial margin of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe consolidation. Streaky opacities at the right base probably reflect atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise stable. Prominence of the right paratracheal soft tissues is unchanged. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
