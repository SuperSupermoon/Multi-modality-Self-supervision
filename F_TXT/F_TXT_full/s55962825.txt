Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, terminating in the left upper quadrant, with side port at the level of the proximal stomach. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal, likely accentuated by portable AP technique. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
