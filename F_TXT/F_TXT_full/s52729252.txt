In comparison with the study of ___, there again are very low lung volumes which accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Substantial elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. The costophrenic angle is more sharply seen, which could reflect some decrease in pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis, though this appearance may merely be a manifestation of a more upright position of the patient. Left lung is essentially clear and there is no definite vascular congestion. Multiple surgical clips are again seen in the left axilla.
