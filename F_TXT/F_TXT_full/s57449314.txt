There is a small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax without evidence of tension. There is a dominant right perihilar mass and multiple scattered nodules throughout both lobes of the lungs. Some of the nodules are cavitary. These are better characterized on the recent CT. There is no new opacity, left pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
