There is near complete whiteout of the left lung with a small amount of left upper lobe still aerated. This likely represents a large pleural effusion with a portion loculated along the left superior lateral chest wall. The right lung appears well aerated. No definite pneumothoraces are seen. Heart size is difficult to assess however it is likely enlarged.
