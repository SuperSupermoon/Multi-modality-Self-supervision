A right internal jugular central line with its tip in the mid SVC. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 2.8 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip likely within the stomach. A left subclavian PICC line also has its tip in the superior vena cava. Overall, cardiomediastinal contours are stable, although difficult to assess due to the diffuse interstitial airspace process, which is essentially unchanged and may represent chronic interstitial changes, although a superimposed acute infectious process or pulmonary edema cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax.
