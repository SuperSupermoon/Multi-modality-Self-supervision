Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position, terminating approximately 5.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, through the stomach, and off the inferior borders of the film. Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous exam. There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The aorta remains tortuous. Moderate pulmonary edema is new in the interval with small bilateral pleural effusions. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
