Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube extending 4.1 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular approach central venous catheter has tip in the low SVC. The enteric tube extends into the stomach with side port near the GE junction. The cardiac silhouette is prominent, but likely accentuated by AP technique and low lung volumes. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is a right-sided pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Dense retrocardiac opacity may represent dependent atelectasis. There is generalized hazy appearance to the lungs.
