The enteric tube is now coiled within the moderate to large hiatal hernia. There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. There is persistent moderate perihilar edema and patchy bibasilar opacities. Aeration of the right base is improved, and the enlarged cardiac silhouette appears slightly less prominent compared to prior studies. Subsequent radiographs available at the time of this interpretation demonstrate a repositioned enteric tube within the distal stomach.
