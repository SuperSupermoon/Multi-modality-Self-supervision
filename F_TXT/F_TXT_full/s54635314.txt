As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above the carinal. Of the intubation, the lung volumes have increased. The 2 right pleural drains are in unchanged position. 2 new hyperlucent lines paralleling the right chest wall are likely caused by skin folds. However, these structures should receive attention on followup radiographs, in order to rule out pneumothorax. New retrocardiac atelectasis. Unchanged appearance of the mediastinum.
