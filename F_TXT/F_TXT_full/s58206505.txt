In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place, as do the leads of a dual-channel pacer device. Low lung volumes are again seen, accentuating the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The degree of perihilar opacification has decreased, consistent with some improvement in the elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification could well represent atelectasis, but in view of apparent air-bronchograms, superimposed infection should be seriously considered in the appropriate clinical setting. On the CT subsequently performed, hilar adenopathy was demonstrated.
