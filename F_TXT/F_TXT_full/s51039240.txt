The study is essentially unchanged from prior except for a right-sided PICC catheter which is now seen malpositioned, coursing through the right subclavian and then upwards into the right internal jugular before kinking and turning downward and terminating within the mid SVC. Tracheostomy tube is unchanged position. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinum is stable and within normal limits. Pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
