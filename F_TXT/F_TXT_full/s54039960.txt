Cardiomediastinal contours are remarkable for left ventricular configuration of the heart and a tortuous thoracic aorta. Interval improved aeration of the lungs compared to ___ with some residual linear atelectasis or scarring in the right juxta hilar and left basilar regions. Persistent blunting of left lateral costophrenic sulcus could reflect pleural thickening or a small left pleural effusion.
