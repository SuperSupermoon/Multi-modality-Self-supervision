AP chest presented for review at 8:30 a.m. on ___, compared to ___: Following right lung biopsy, large opacity in the mid lung is presumably local hemorrhage and/or atelectasis. New right pleural tube runs over the apex of the lung to the base of the hemithorax, with no appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Moderately extensive infiltrative pulmonary abnormality is more pronounced now than earlier, probably a component of concurrent pulmonary edema, also increasing heart size.
