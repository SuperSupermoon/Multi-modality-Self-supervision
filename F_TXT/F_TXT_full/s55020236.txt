Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 7.5 cm above the carina and could be advanced a few centimeters for standard positioning. Other indwelling devices are in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance except for development of mild vascular pedicle widening accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema. Layering right pleural effusion appears slightly smaller than on the prior exam, but positional and projectional differences may contribute to this apparent change. No visible pneumothorax but exclusion of left costophrenic angle from radiograph limits evaluation for basilar pneumothorax on the left. Multiple left rib fractures are present as well as a left scapular fracture.
