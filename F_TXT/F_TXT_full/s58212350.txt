The tip of the endotracheal tube is difficult to exactly discern, but appears to be appropriately situated at the level of the thoracic inlet, approximately 5 cm from the carina. Enteric tube tip is within the stomach. As seen previously, there is continued extensive subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and a left basal lateral hydropneumothorax, all similar compared to the most recent previous study. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Scarring within the right hilar region is similar. Patchy opacities in the lung bases appear more pronounced in the interval, and likely reflect aspiration or infection.
