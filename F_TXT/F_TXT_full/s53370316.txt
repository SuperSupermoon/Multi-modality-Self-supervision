Compared to ___, an asymmetrically distributed bilateral combined alveolar and interstitial process demonstrates interval improvement in the left lung but slight progression in the right lower lung. Observed findings may be due to a combination of widespread pneumonia and pulmonary edema. A component of chronic interstitial lung disease is suspected. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also noted.
