As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Pigtail catheter in the right pleural space, no evidence of substantial recurrence of the pre-existing effusion. Minimal increase in radiodensity at the right lung base, likely reflecting atelectasis, but no convincing evidence for the presence of a right pneumothorax. On the left, the small left hemithorax, the opacities in the AP hilar lung regions and the blunting of the costophrenic sinus, combined to mild cardiomegaly persist.
