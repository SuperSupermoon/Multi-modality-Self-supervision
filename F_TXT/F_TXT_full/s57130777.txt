Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be evaluated, it is obscured by pleural effusions. Almost complete opacification of the left hemithorax is due to multiloculated large left pleural effusion and known mediastinal fluid collection, better seen in prior CT. There is minimal aeration in the left lower hemithorax. Left basal pig tail catheter is in unchanged position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. Small right effusion is less conspicuous than before. Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved.
