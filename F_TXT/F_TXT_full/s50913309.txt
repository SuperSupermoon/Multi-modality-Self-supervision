As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Lung volumes have decreased. A pre-existing small left pleural effusion has increased in extent. The low lung volumes contribute to crowding of the vascular and bronchial structures at the lung bases. Slight patient rotation to the left also emphasizes the extent of the pre-existing left parenchymal opacity. The sternal wires are of unchanged alignment.
