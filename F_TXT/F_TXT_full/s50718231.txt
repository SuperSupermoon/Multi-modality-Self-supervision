The heart is moderately enlarged and probably increased somewhat since prior examination. Pulmonary vessels are indistinct and the central interstitium is mildly prominent in the mid to lower lungs. The overall impression is of probable mild vascular congestion. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A healed fracture of the left sixth rib is again present.
