There is a new endotracheal tube with the tip in mid trachea, approximately 4.4 cm from the carina. Subclavian PICC line is again visualized, but the tip is at the junction of the brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava. Again visualized is a moderate layering left pleural effusion as well as a small right pleural effusion. Left basilar atelectasis appears unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable. There is no evidence of new consolidations, effusions, or pneumothoraces.
