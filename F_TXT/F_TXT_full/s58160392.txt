As compared to the previous image, the patient has a new nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The known pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities are unchanged in extent and severity.
