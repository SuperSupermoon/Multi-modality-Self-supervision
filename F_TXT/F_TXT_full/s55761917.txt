The lungs are clear. There is no consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are normal. The heart size is at the upper limits of normal. The patient is status post sternotomy with unchanged post-surgical changes in the mediastinum. A vertical thin catheter overlies the right hemithorax, lower neck, and upper abdomen. This is of uncertain etiology and may be outside the patient. Recommend clinical correlation.
