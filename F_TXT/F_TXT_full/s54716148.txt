Low lung volumes are seen with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings and increased interstitial markings. Overlying soft tissues also contribute to the appearance of increased interstitial markings. Abnormal contour of the AP window is compatible with prominent fat and lymphadenopathy as seen on prior chest CT as well as enlarged pulmonary artery. There is no confluent consolidation or large effusion. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged similar to prior.
