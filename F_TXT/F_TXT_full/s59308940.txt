AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 5:50 a.m.: Endotracheal tube has been removed. Tiny left apical pneumothorax is new or newly apparent. Lung volumes are greater, and there is less distention of mediastinal and pulmonary vessels indicating improved hemodynamic status. Left lung base, however, has grown more radiopaque and whether this is residual dependent edema or developing consolidation will require followup radiographs. Right lower lobe is largely atelectatic and moderate right pleural effusion persists. Bilateral pleural drains are unchanged in their respective positions.
