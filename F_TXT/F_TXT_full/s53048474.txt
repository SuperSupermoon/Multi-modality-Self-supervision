Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiac size is top normal. Small right pleural effusion has increased. Right Port-A-Cath tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC. Increasing right perihilar and lower lobe opacities are most likely due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
