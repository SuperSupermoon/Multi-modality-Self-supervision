Hyperinflated lungs consistent with emphysema. Increased interstitial markings and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature are concerning for early heart failure. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. A lobulation of the aortic contour corresponds to a saccular aneurysm of the aortic arch that is better characterized on the prior CT chest.
