1. Patchy basilar opacities, including volume loss at the left base and retrocardiac opacification. This appearance could be seen with atelectasis or airway inflammation, but pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful to evaluate further, if clinically indicated, preferably with standard PA and lateral technique if possible clinically. 2. Convex contour to the right upper mediastinum, which is likely to reflect tortuosity of the great vessels. However, given the setting of known malignancy it is difficult to exclude other etiology such as lymphadenopathy. Accordingly, if available, direct comparison to earlier radiographs is suggested to assess for stability of this appearance. Discussed with Dr. ___ at 12:30 pm on ___ by telephone.
