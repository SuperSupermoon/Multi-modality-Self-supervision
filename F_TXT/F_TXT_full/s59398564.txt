AP chest, with no recent chest radiographs for comparison. Thickening of the right apical pleural margin adjacent to upper rib fractures is a hematoma. There also may be a small right pleural effusion or hemothorax layering in the lower chest. Mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement probably reflect volume overload but there is no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax or appreciable lung contusion. Normal mediastinal and hilar contours.
