In comparison to ___, there is increased opacity of the left mid lung, which may represent fluid trapped in an accessory minor fissure. This could be confirmed with a additional lateral view of the chest or CT. Bilateral pleural effusions are seen, with the left effusion worse compared to previous. There are also associated bibasilar compressive atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion bilaterally appears unchanged. Low lung volumes bilaterally. No significant change in cardiomediastinal contours. Transvenous pacer leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
