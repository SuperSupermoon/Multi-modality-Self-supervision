Comparison is made with prior study performed four hours earlier. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The left lower lobe opacity, a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion is also stable. There is no evident pneumothorax or right pleural effusion. Lines and tubes remain in place in standard, unchanged position. Of note, the Swan-Ganz catheter tip is at the takeoff of the main pulmonary artery.
