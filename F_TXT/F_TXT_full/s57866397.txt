Large left pleural effusion is similar in appearance to the previous study, the previously reported small loculated hydropneumothorax is no longer evident. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Interstitial edema has resolved, and small right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size. Otherwise, no relevant short interval change.
