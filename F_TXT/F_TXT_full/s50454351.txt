Endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Interval reduction in lung volumes with appearance of patchy bibasilar opacities most likely representing atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. There is possibly a layering left effusion. Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no overt pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-supine technique.
