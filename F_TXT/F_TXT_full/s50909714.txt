Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed. Compared to the most recent prior study, the volume of the left lung has improved and it is now clear. Increased opacity in the right lower lung that tracks along the lateral pleural surface represents a small to moderate right pleural effusion that has been increasing compared to the studies performed after the right sided thoracentesis. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Normal heart size and a tortuous calcified arota are unchanged.
