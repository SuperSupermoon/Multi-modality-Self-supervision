The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, reflective of a tortuous thoracic aorta and probable mild cardiomegaly. Lung volumes are low. There is probably minimal left basilar atelectasis. Otherwise, there is no new focal lung consolidation. There is no pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. It would be difficult to exclude a small left pleural effusion given appearance. No sizable right pleural effusion.
