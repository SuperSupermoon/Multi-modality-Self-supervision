The patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina. Vascular pedicle seems widened which is probably due to some degree of fluid overload. Marked opacification of each mid to upper lung is suggestive of pulmonary edema. Differential diagnoses include acute respiratory distress syndrome or widespread multifocal pneumonia. A coinciding opacity at the left lung base may be due to atelectasis or pneumonia. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
