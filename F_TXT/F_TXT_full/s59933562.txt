AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained seven hours earlier during the same day. The female patient with history of lung cancer, is status post VATS procedure with left pleurodesis and Pleurx catheter placement. Comparison of the present portable chest examination demonstrates grossly unchanged position of a previously described left-sided pleural catheter. The pleural density along the lateral and apical chest wall has increased. Also noted is an air distended stomach with elevated right atrium, a factor, which may contribute to the patient's overall poor respiratory condition. As before, low pulmonary volumes are seen. No pneumothorax has developed.
