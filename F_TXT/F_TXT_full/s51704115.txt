Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is an ET tube, NG tube and right-sided PICC line, nominal in position. Also again seen are low inspiratory volumes, with pronounced patchy opacity at both lung bases. There is mild vascular plethora. While a small amount of layering of fluid cannot be excluded on left, no gross effusion is identified. No pneumothorax detected.
