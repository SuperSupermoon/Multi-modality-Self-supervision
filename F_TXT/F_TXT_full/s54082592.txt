Interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter, the tip projects over the cavoatrial junction. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea. A gastric tube extends below the level the diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. The small right pneumothorax and a parenchymal contusions seen on the prior CT chest are not evident radiographically. The known rib and sternal fractures were better evaluated on the earlier cross-sectional imaging.
