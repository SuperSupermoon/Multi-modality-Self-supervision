AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. There is interval extubation of the patient with removal of the NG tube but with Swan-Ganz catheter still in place with its tip projecting at the level of the right ventricle outflow tract. The patient continues to be with enlarged cardiac silhouette, unchanged since the prior study with bibasal areas of atelectasis. Interval development of perihilar vascular engorgement is consistent with fluid overload/mild pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusion cannot be excluded, mild. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.
