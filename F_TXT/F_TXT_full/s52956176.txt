CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. A right IJ central line is present, tip over right atrium, relatively low. Clinical correlation regarding possible retraction is requested. There are low inspiratory volumes. There is probable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, even allowing for this. There are diffuse patchy opacities throughout both lungs, increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and equivocal small effusions. Again seen is diffuse increased density of the bones, likely related to the patient's sickle cell. Increased density at the right humeral head could be due to osteonecrosis. Compared with ___ at 2:04 a.m. and allowing for technical differences, no definite interval change.
