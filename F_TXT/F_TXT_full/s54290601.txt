A tracheostomy is in-situ, unchanged in position compared to the prior study. Lung volumes are slightly low but unchanged compared to the prior study. There is a developing opacity at the right lung base, likely within the right middle lobe. This may be due to atelectasis however infection cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen. Incidental note is made of an azygos fissure.
