There is extensive posterior spinal stabilization hardware in-situ, incompletely visualized. This partially obscures the tracheostomy tube which is grossly unchanged in position. A left-sided PICC terminates in the azygos vein as seen on multiple prior studies. There is persistent left lower lobe atelectasis and a hazy opacity at the right lung base likely reflecting layering of a pleural effusion which is increased compared to the prior study. There is also a right lower lobe atelectasis. Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature may reflect a degree of fluid overload.
