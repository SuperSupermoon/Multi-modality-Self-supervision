Comparison is made with prior study performed 12 hours earlier. Component of pulmonary edema has worsened, now moderate. Background of multifocal pneumonia is probably unchanged. There has been interval increase in large right effusion. Small-to-moderate left effusion is more conspicuous than before. Cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be assessed; it is obscured by the pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.
