1. Left subclavian Port-A-Cath and right subclavian PICC are unchanged. Interval reduction in lung volumes with patchy opacities at both bases most likely representing areas of atelectasis. No crowding of the vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema. No large effusions. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient rotation between studies.
