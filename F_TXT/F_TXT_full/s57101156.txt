A semi-upright frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. The carina is not well seen, but the endotracheal tube is directed towards the right main stem bronchus. A nasogastric tube follows the expected course, although the tip is below the inferior level of the image. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Right linear atelectasis is seen. Mild opacity in the right upper lobe may represent atelectasis or early infection. Heart size is within normal limits. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
