Compared to prior exam, there is increased pulmonary edema, which is now moderate-to-severe. Subtle consolidation may be obscured by this edema. There is likely a left pleural effusion; retrocardiac opacity may be related to adjacent atelectasis but is incompletely evaluated on this single view. No pneumothorax is detected. Cardiomegaly persists.
