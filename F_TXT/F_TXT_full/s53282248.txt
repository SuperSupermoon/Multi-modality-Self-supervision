Portable chest radiograph demonstrates a right-sided PICC line within the right atrium. The endotracheal tube is stable in position with tip terminating 4 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing into stomach and out of view, though the side hole is apparent at the GE junction. There is stable cardiomegaly and prominence of the hila. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is minimally improved aeration compared to prior radiograph with persistent pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis. Plate-like atelectasis again noted along the minor fissure. No pneumothorax evident.
