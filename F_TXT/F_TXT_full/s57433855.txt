AP chest compared to ___ and ___. Moderate left pleural effusion is stable, small right pleural effusion has increased. Severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement are unchanged. I doubt there is pulmonary edema. The visible portions of the lungs are clear. Lung bases are not fully aerated, usually due to atelectasis but not excluding pneumonia. Left PIC line ends in the axilla, as before.
