The patient is status post recent esophageal stent placement with a stent extending from approximately the T4 vertebral body level to the T11 level. Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Heterogeneous opacities in the right mid and lower lung have slightly improved since the recent radiograph, and the left lung remains grossly clear. Small pleural effusions, right greater than left, are not appreciably changed.
