Moderate to large right pleural effusion has developed in the setting of worsening right lower lobe pneumonia. Moderate left pleural effusion is new and there is more consolidation at the left base as well. Heart is not enlarged and the pulmonary vasculature is not engorged so I do No pneumothorax. Not believe there is a contribution of heart failure to these new and worsening abnormalities. ET tube in standard placement. Esophageal drainage tube ends in the upper stomach would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports below the diaphragm.
