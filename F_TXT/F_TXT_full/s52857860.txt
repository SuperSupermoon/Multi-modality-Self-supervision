An endotracheal tube is noted terminating approximately 4.5 cm above the level of the carina. Low lung volumes results in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Streaky airspace opacities at the right lung base likely reflect atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or overt pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The patient is status post cervical spinal fusion.
