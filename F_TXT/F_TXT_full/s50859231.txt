Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There is a small right basal/lateral pneumothorax. There are persistent low lung volumes. Widened mediastinum has minimally improved. The course of the NG tube is unchanged. Mediastinal drain is again noted. Vascular congestion has resolved. Small bilateral effusions have probably decreased. There is pneumoperitoneum .
