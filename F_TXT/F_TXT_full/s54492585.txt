Again seen is a right PICC line with tip terminating in the mid SVC. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain stable. There is improvement in the left basilar opacity. A small left pleural effusion persists. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. A new right basilar opacity is present, likely atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
