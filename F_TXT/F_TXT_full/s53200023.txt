New ET tube in standard placement. New esophageal drainage tube coiled in the upper portion of a nondistended stomach. Moderate enlarged of the cardiac silhouette is increased substantially along with venous caliber of the upper mediastinum, due to cardiomegaly, presumably biventricular and/or pericardial effusion. Clinical correlation advised. Left lung is low in volume but clear. Right lung base is now elevated, perhaps due to dense consolidation in the middle lobe. There is also consolidation in the lower lobe obscuring the normal diaphragmatic interface.
