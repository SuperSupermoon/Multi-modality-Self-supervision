1. Two right-sided chest tubes remain unchanged in position, both of which terminate at the apex. The previously described pigtail catheter at the right lung base has been removed. There is some increase in consolidation at the right base with overall decrease in volume of the right lung since the previous study. These findings would favor atelectasis in the setting of an increasing effusion. The left lung is grossly clear. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable, although difficult to assess due to the right-sided airspace consolidation. Multiple radiopaque densities in the right upper quadrant and midline are likely related to the patient's treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. The chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is diminishing. A tiny right apical pneumothorax is likely present, although the loculated basilar pneumothorax is no longer appreciated. No pulmonary edema.
