Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. ET tube tip is 2 cm above the carina. There are low lung volumes. New opacities in the left lower lobe are worrisome for aspiration. Atelectases in the right lower lobe have increased. There is no pneumothorax or large effusions. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
