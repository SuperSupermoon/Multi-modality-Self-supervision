A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates new pulmonary edema as well as engorgement of the mediastinal vasculature, consistent with acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure. In addition there may be consolidation of the left lower lobe obscuring the descending aortic contour. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The heart size is top normal.
