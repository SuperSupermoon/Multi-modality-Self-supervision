Low lung volumes are present. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are likely within normal limits. A right brachiocephalic venous stent is re- demonstrated. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
