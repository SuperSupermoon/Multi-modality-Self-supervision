Aeration has suffered considerably following tracheal extubation. The quality low the right lung suggest it is worsening edema on that is. On the left there is substantially more consolidation, but whether, in addition to increased edema this is more atelectasis or pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate. Moderate left pleural effusion is still present. Heart is enlarged although left heart border is obscured making it hard to assess the size. Transesophageal drainage tube has also been removed. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax.
