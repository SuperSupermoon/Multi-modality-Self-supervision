Again seen is the left subclavian central line with tip over proximal/mid SVC. No pneumothorax detected. Again seen is cardiomegaly, with a calcified unfolded aorta and mild prominence of both hila with a tapered appearance. Inspiratory volumes are slightly improved. There is continued upper zone redistribution, vascular plethora, and mild vascular blurring, consistent with CHF and interstitial edema, which may also be very slightly improved. Faint hazy opacity in the left perihilar/infrahilar and right infrahilar area is noted, question reflecting CHF. Again seen is in is retrocardiac opacity. This appears more pronounced and there has been interval obscuration left hemidiaphragm, consistent with progressive left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. This possibility of a small left effusion cannot be excluded. At the extreme edge of these films, fusion/fixation hardware is noted in the cervical spine.
