Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing 3.7 cm above the carina. The NG tube is seen with its tip in the left upper abdomen. A left chest tube is in place. Subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the left base of neck and chest wall. Subtle air lucency adjacent to the aortic knob is compatible with pneumomediastinum. Lower lobe consolidation is evidenced by retrocardiac consolidation containing a single air bronchogram. No discernable pneumothorax is seen. No definitive rib fracture is identified.
