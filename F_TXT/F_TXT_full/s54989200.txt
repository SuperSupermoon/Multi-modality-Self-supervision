1. Dual-lead left-sided pacer remains in place. The patient is status post median sternotomy and there are multiple surgical clips overlying the cardiac and mediastinal contours as well as the upper abdomen. Left basilar chest tube remains in place and the loculated pneumothorax at the left base may be slightly smaller as a fluid level is no longer appreciated; however, this could just be related to differences in positioning. Multiple right-sided rib fractures are again identified. There continues to be patchy left basalir opacity likely reflecting atelectasis. Small right effusion is now evident.
