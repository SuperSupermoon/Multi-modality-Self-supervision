1. Right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. Status post median sternotomy with stable post-operative cardiac and mediastinal contours. There is a patchy opacity at the left base with an associated small pleural effusion likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Interval decrease in size of a small left apical pneumothorax which is barely seen on the current examination. Patchy opacity at the right base most likely reflects an area of atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. Interval appearance of retrocardiac opacity with blunting of the costophrenic angle suggestive of partial lower lobe compressive atelectasis due to the presence of a small effusion.
