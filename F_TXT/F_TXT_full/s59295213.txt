As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. There is minimal increase of the opacities that preexisted in the right lower lung. Overall, the opacities are massive and relatively homogeneous, showing air bronchograms and likely reflecting the clinical picture of ARDS. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
