Feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Interval removal of right internal jugular central line and extubation. There are unchanged layering bilateral effusions with bibasilar airspace consolidation most likely representing partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pulmonary edema. No obvious pneumothorax. Prominence of the right hilum is felt to be related to patient rotation on the current study.
