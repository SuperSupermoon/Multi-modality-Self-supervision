Comparison is made to prior study from ___. Since the previous study, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube whose tip is 1 cm above the carina and could be pulled back at least 2-3 cm for optimal placement. There is crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings. The right-sided IJ line has the distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. There remains a left retrocardiac opacity and low lung volumes with atelectasis at the lung bases.
