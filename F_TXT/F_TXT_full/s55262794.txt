Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aortic knob is densely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with bilateral hilar enlargement suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Lungs are hyperinflated with paucity of pulmonary vascular markings towards the upper lobes compatible with severe emphysema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical setting. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, although the extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
