Right chest tube remains in place. There is some lucency along the right medial heart border and cardiophrenic angle which could represent loculated air. No definite apical component is seen. Linear opacity at the right base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. The left lung is grossly clear. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral chest wall. Bullet fragments are seen in the right axillary soft tissues.
