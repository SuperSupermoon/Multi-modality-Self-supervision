1. Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which has its tip approximately 5 to 6 cm above the carina but appears to be in satisfactory position. There is a nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm, which appears to be coiled within the proximal stomach. Lungs again are hyperinflated suggesting underlying emphysema, and there are stable postoperative changes on the right side. Both pulmonary arteries remain prominent, consistent with underlying pulmonary artery hypertension. Heart remains within normal limits in size. The aorta appears somewhat dilated and unfolded on the current examination, likely related to marked patient rotation to the right. No evidence of pneumothorax.
