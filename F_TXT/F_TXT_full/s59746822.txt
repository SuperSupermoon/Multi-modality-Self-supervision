Compared with ___:30, there is improved aeration of the left upper zone. The large left effusion seen on the most recent prior film has decreased in size, though remains quite large. As before, there is underlying left lung collapse and/or consolidation. However, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is now restored to midline. Upper zone vessels on the left are prominent, likely related to compressive atelectasis. On the right, there is a rind of increased opacity as well as increased interstitial markings the right lung apex, unchanged. There is hazy opacity at the right lung base, likely reflecting a combination of a small pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis, similar to the prior study. A thin catheter other tubing overlies the right lung, unchanged. Doubt CHF on the right. No pneumothorax detected on either side. Indwelling right subclavian catheter tip adjacent to SVC/RA junction, unchanged.
