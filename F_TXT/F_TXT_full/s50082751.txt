A central venous line in the right neck terminates at the level of the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The heart size is normal. Apparent prominence of the right hilus on this frontal projection is likely due to right middle lobe opacity as seen on the prior outside chest CT.
