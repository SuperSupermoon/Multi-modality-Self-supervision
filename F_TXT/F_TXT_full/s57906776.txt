Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. Moderate left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis has not improved since ___ at. Pulmonary vascular engorgement is new and there is borderline interstitial edema seen best in the right lower lung. Patient has had T AVR. Heart is not grossly enlarged. No pneumothorax. Small right pleural effusion stable. 2 well-defined nodular opacities projecting over the right axilla and adjacent right upper lobe are new, presumably external artifacts. Conventional chest radiographs should be obtained when feasible. In the abdomen new tubing projects over the stomach and lower esophagus, but I can't tell whether these are internal or external either. Clinical correlation advised.
