The ET tube is not visualized on the current study and is apparently been removed. Clinical correlation is requested. An NG type tube extends to a site overlying the left lung base, presumably ___ within the stomach at the site of a large left hiatal hernia. Again seen is extensive opacification of the left mid and lower zones. On today's study, there is additional hazy opacity extending into the lower portion of the left upper zone. The right lung is similar in appearance, with hazy opacity at right lung base which could reflect pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Background interstitial opacities in the right upper and mid could represent either interstitial edema or other interstitial infiltrates.
