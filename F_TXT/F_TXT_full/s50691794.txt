A single upright portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. An NG tube courses below the level of the diaphragm, with its tip positioned in the mid stomach. Lung volumes are low. There is minimal bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal. There is no definite pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Subtle lucency under the right hemidiaphragm is concerning for pneumoperitoneum. Air is seen within non-dilated loops of colon. Previously seen air-filled dilated loops of small bowel on the prior radiograph from earlier today are not identified on the present study.
