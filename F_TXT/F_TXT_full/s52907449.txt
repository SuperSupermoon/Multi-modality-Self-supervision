Single upright portable view of the chest demonstrates an enteric catheter passing below the gastroesophageal junction, with tip terminating in the fundus of the stomach. Right upper quadrant cholecystectomy clips and residual excreted IV contrast material in the bilateral renal collecting systems are noted. The lung volumes are slightly low, but clear, with no evidence of focal air space opacity, pleural effusion, pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. The right costophrenic sulcus is excluded on this study. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable, with a top normal-sized heart. Dilated loops of mid abdominal small bowel are also noted.
