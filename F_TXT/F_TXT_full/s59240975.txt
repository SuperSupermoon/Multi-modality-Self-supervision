An endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view on this single image. The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant bronchovascular crowding and accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. No infiltrate or large pneumothorax is identified. No displaced rib fractures detected.
