Low lung volumes are present. The heart is mildly enlarged. Superior mediastinum is widened, though this partially may be due to supine positioning and low inspiratory volumes. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted, but no pulmonary edema is seen. Hazy rounded opacity is seen within the left mid lung field, which is nonspecific but could reflect an area of contusion. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No displaced fractures are visualized.
