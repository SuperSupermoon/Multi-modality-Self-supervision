Comparison is made with prior study ___. There are low lung volumes. There is no evident pneumothorax. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has worsened consistent with enlarged left lower lobe atelectasis. Right lower lobe opacities have also increased consistent with increasing atelectasis. Mild-to-moderate vascular congestion has minimally increased. Bilateral pleural effusions are larger on the left side. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is at the take-off of the right main pulmonary artery.
