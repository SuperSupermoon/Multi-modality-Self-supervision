Slightly rotated positioning. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.0 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip and sideport overlying the stomach. A right IJ central line is present, tip overlying the distal SVC. A pigtail catheter overlies the left lung. There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema about the chest, left-greater-than- right. This obscures the presence of a subtle pneumothorax, particularly as the patient is supine and no lateral view is available. Allowing for this, no gross pneumothorax is identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains midline. There is hazy and somewhat patchy opacity at both lung bases and probably also a smaller area of faint patchy opacity in the right upper zone. The right and question left cardiophrenic angles are obscured. There is upper zone redistribution and minimal vascular plethora.
