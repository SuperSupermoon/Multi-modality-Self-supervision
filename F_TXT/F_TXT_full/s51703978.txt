Tip of the ET tube is no less than 7 cm from the carina and could be advanced 2 cm for more secured seating. The endotracheal tube cuff is mildly overinflated distending the trachea. The upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach, but I cannot tell whether I am seeing the gap in the marker stripe, which is 10 cm from the tip or a tube without such gap, and placed with its tip just barely in the upper stomach. Next radiograph should include more of the stomach so I can tell the difference. Lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces are normal. Right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC.
