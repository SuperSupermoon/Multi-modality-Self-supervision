The endotracheal tube has been advanced and now terminates at the level of the clavicular heads. A nasoenteric catheter courses below the diaphragm and the tip is visualized just below the left hemidiaphragm indicating that it is coiled within the stomach. Lung volumes remain low resulting in bronchovascular crowding. Bibasilar opacities are similar to recent prior and are likely atelectasis. There is no overt pulmonary edema or large pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
