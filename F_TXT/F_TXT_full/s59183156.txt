1. The patient is markedly rotated to her right, limiting assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours, although they appear to be unchanged. However, despite rotation, there is some shift of the mediastinal structures to the right suggesting volume loss within the right lung which has likely not significantly changed. The left lung is grossly clear. Vasculature is cephalized consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension, but no overt pulmonary edema is seen. No pneumothorax. No large effusions. Multiple surgical clips in the epigastric region are again noted.
