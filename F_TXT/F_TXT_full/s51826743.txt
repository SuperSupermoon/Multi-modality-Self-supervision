A right-sided central internal jugular line tip is in the low SVC. An enteric catheter projects off the film. The endotracheal tube tip remains at the inferior margin of the clavicles. A left subclavian vein line has been removed. A curvilinear right convex thin radiopaque line projects over the right heart border. This line likely represents a heavily calcified aortic arch. A similar linear opaque line is seen on the left side of the ascending aorta. Lung volumes are low. There is stable bilateral perihilar haze, bronchial cuffing, and a small left effusion. No new consolidation or pneumothorax is present.
