The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including borderline cardiomegaly. A vague opacity persists in the right upper lobe, described as an irregular nodule on the prior CT and not well characterized on this examination. There is also patchy opacity in the left lower lung, similar to increased compared to prior studies, although it may be due to exaggeration or increase in pre-existing minor atelectasis. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
