Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from earlier the same day at 2:12 p.m. There is a new left IJ central venous catheter with tip likely in the upper SVC, although exact delineation of the tip is limited given overlying cardiac leads. It does not appear to terminate below the level of the RA-SVC junction. There is no visualized pneumothorax. Appearance of the lungs and cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unchanged.
