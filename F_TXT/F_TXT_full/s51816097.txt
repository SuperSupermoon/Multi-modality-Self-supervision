Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and several prior studies dating back to ___. ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is passing the diaphragm, terminating in the stomach. Multiple calcified opacities projecting over the left upper quadrant might represent calcified splenic artery aneurysms. As compared to prior radiograph, there is interval dilatation of the upper mediastinum, reason is unclear. Please correlate with recent attempt of central venous placing and if there is any possibility of trauma, evaluation of the patient with CT of the chest is required. Bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema are unchanged.
