Widespread, heterogeneous pulmonary opacities have substantially improved, most likely representing pulmonary edema given rapid response following diuresis. Residual opacities are more pronounced at the bases than in the remainder of the lungs, and affect the right lower lobe to a greater degree than the left. Continued radiographic followup would be helpful to exclude co-existing pneumonia, particularly in the right lung. Small pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
