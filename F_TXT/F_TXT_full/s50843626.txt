Endotracheal tube has its tip 4.5 cm above the carina. Intra-aortic balloon pump has its tip 3 cm below the top of the aortic knob. Femoral Swan-Ganz catheter has its tip in the pulmonary outflow tract. There is diffuse bilateral predominantly central parenchymal airspace process most consistent with severe pulmonary edema, although pulmonary hemorrhage or a diffuse infectious process should also be considered. Clinical correlation is recommended. There is moderate gastric distension. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. The heart is mildly enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered.
