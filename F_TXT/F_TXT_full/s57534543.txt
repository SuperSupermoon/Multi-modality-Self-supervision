Since the prior exam, there is no significant change. An endotracheal tube is in place 4.7 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube is present coursing below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. A left PICC is in place with the tip in the upper SVC. There is stable opacification at the right base, unchanged from prior exam. There is no new opacity. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
