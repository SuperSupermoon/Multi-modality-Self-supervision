AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-erect position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Unchanged position of tracheostomy cannula. PICC line has been pulled back by about 3 cm and terminates, now overlying the superior mediastinal structures, 2 cm above the carina. This is close to the expected junction with the subclavian vein, but appears acceptable. Other extensive right-sided pleural effusion is unchanged. Evidence of multiple sternotomy wires in midline as before. Within the heart shadow, the metallic components of a porcine aortic valve prosthesis is identified. Heart size cannot be assessed on this single view chest examination because of other overlying structures.
