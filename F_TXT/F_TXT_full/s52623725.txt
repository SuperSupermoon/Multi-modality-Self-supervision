A single portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained. Subcutaneous emphysema in the right and left lateral margins of the chest and lower cervical regions is extensive. An air-filled retrocardiac structure is similar to the pre-operative appearance of the large hiatal hernia. The cardiac silhouette is widened by AP portable technique.
