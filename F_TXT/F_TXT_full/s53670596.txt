Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates slight interval improvement in interstitial prominence consistent with slightly improved pulmonary edema, now mild. A small right pleural effusion remains. There is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. A focus of linear atelectasis in the retrocardiac region is noted. The heart size is normal, accentuated by portable technique, the mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
