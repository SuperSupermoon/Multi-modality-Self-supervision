Enteric feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement. Left base opacity is seen, which again may be due to pleural effusion and atelectasis, underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude. New since the prior study. There is right lower lobe consolidation which is worrisome for infection or aspiration. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
