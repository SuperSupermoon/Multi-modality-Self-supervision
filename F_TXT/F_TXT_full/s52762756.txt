Compared with ___ at 424, there has been interval obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and increased retrocardiac density, consistent with increased left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. The presence of a small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is cardiomegaly, with CHF and interstitial edema. ET tube tip approximately 4.0 cm above the carina. PICC line tip over proximal SVC. No pneumothorax detected.
