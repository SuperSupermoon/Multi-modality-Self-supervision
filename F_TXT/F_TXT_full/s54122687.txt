Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Tracheostomy tube is seen in standard position. Right PICC tip is in the upper SVC. Transvenous pacemaker leads are in unchanged positions in the right atrium and likely in the right ventricle. The cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the right as before. Right pleural effusion with adjacent consolidation has increased. Left lower lobe opacities are unchanged. It could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. No other interval change.
