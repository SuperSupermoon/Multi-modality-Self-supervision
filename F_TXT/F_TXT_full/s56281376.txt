The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. A small right apical pneumothorax appears unchanged. A small right-sided pleural effusion is not well assessed, being largely subpulmonic. Streaky right lower lung opacification suggests atelectasis, similar to findings on the recent prior chest CT. However, more diffuse opacification has improved since the prior radiographs. Non-displaced fractures of the right posterior fourth and fifth ribs are visible.
