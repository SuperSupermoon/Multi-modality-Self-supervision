The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is persistent volume loss in the right hemithorax with band-like opacity in the right lower lung, a fiducial marker, and similar effacement of the right costophrenic sulcus. However, the appearance is very similar to the prior study. Although a persistent pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on the right, there is no evidence for one on the left.
