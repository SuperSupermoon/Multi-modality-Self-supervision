The patient has metastatic small cell lung cancer. No prior chest imaging is available for comparison. Reference made to report of chest abdomen and pelvis CT from Atruis performed on ___. That report reported at least 8 cm left suprahilar mass contiguous with confluent mediastinal and hilar adenopathy. Bilateral spiculated upper lobe lung masses. Multiple left-sided pleural based nodules. On the current study, patchy opacity is seen in the right upper to mid lung as well as dense patchy opacity at the left lung apex. There is also enlargement of the left AP window/suprahilar region. Findings likely relate to patient's known metastatic lung cancer. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. No large pleural effusion is seen although there may be a small amount of left apical fluid. Reticulonodular opacities also projecting over the left upper lung may relate to known malignancy.
