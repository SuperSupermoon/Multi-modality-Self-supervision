A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. A right subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip in the distal SVC. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip 3.7 cm above the carina. There are fluctuating asymmetric parenchymal opacities, now right greater than left, favoring pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi supine technique. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.
