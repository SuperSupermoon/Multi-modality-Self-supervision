There is no pneumothorax. Left-sided pacemaker has three leads, one in right atrium, one in right ventricle and the last one in the coronary sinus. Left jugular line is at the junction of brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava. Right-sided PICC line is still looped in the distal subclavian vein and ends in the upper SVC. Bibasilar consolidation which is probably atelectasis is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. The stomach is more dilated than previous exam.
