Cardiomegaly is accompanied by new pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate pulmonary edema, accompanied by small bilateral pleural effusions. The areas of apparent edema involve the right lung to a greater degree than the left. Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful to confirm this diagnosis and to exclude the possibility of pneumonia co-existing with pulmonary edema.
