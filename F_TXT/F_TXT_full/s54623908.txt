Penetration is poor secondary to body habitus. The lower lungs are particularly difficult to see and a lateral view would be very helpful in assessment. Pulmonary edema present in ___ has cleared. There may be new consolidation in the right lower lobe. Left lower lobe is obscured by soft tissue and cardiac silhouette, and the cardiac apex is obscured by the abdomen. Heart is probably not enlarged, but upper lobe vascular redistribution is an indication of borderline cardiac dysfunction. If there pleural effusions they are not large.
