As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Unchanged appearance of the left postoperative lung with decrease in size of the hemithorax. Unchanged opacities at the right lung base, potentially caused by atelectasis or, possibly, aspiration. Short-term further radiographic followup should be performed. No larger pleural effusions.
