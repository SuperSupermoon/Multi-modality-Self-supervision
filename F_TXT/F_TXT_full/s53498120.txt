Frontal semi-erect view of the chest was obtained. Left internal jugular central catheter terminates in stable position, across the midline, in either the upper SVC or the left brachiocephalic vein. Known right upper lung abscess is not clearly visualized on this radiograph due to semi-erect position. Diffuse right hemithorax opacification remains, though aeration of the right lung appears slightly improved. The left costophrenic angle is excluded on this study.
