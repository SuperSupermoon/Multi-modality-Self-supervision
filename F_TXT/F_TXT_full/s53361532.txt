The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. There is patchy opacity at the left lateral lung base, which was not seen on the scout image from the prior CT scan and is compatible with a new left lung base pneumonia. The lungs appear otherwise clear. No pleural effusion. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
