Left lower paraspinal widening has increased, consistent with paraspinal fluid such as hemorrhage. There is no evidence elsewhere in the left hemi thorax of pleural or other fluid collection. Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size which is probably normal. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements respectively. A left PIC line ends in the upper SVC.
