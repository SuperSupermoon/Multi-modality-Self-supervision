There is a new large left-sided pneumothorax with a deep sulcus sign with rightward displacement of the mediastinum raising concern for tension pneumothorax. Otherwise, there is a new left-sided central line that is seen crossing the midline and ending likely at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. An esophageal tube is noted with the tip beyond the gastroesophageal junction. The endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the carina, unchanged compared with prior exam. Again seen is right lower lung opacities that now appear slightly more conspicuous than in prior likely secondary to underlying basal atelectases. There is also blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which may be secondary to atelectatic lung.
