Emphysematous changes are re- demonstrated. The lung volumes are decreased compared to the prior study. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Old bilateral rib fractures are again noted.
