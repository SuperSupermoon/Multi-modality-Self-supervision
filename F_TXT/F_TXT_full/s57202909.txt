AP chest compared to ___: Heart size top normal, unchanged. Greater opacification at the base of the right lung could be due either to posteriorly layering pleural effusion or parenchymal abnormality in the right lower lobe, including aspiration. Mediastinal venous engorgement suggests either elevated central venous pressure or more likely supine positioning. Endotracheal and enteric two drainage tubes have both been removed. Right subclavian line ends in the mid-to-low SVC. No indication of pneumothorax.
