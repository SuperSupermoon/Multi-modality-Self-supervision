In comparison with the study of ___, there is again extensive opacification in the right hemithorax consistent with large pleural effusion and compressive basilar atelectasis. Opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural fluid. Left perihilar opacity is unchanged. Right IJ catheter is stable and there again are multiple kyphoplasty procedures identified.
