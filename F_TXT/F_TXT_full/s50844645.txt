In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a right chest tube and Pleurx tube with some residual pleural effusion. There is a large area of loculated gas in the right upper zone, consistent with a loculated pneumothorax. Extensive opacification along the right lateral chest wall is consistent with subcutaneous emphysema. The left lung is essentially clear.
