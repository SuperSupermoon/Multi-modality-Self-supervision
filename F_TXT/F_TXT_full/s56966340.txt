As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. There is a massive newly appeared opacity at the level of the right upper lobe, suggesting the presence of a complete right upper lobe atelectasis. This is combined with an increasing amount of right pleural effusion so that large parts of the right hemithorax are completely opacified. The signs indicative of pulmonary edema in the left lung have minimally decreased. The heart appears to remain enlarged. No left-sided pneumothorax.
