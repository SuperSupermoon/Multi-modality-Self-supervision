1. Interval removal of the Dobbhoff feeding tube with placement of a nasogastric which is seen coursing in the upper esophagus and then the distal portion is seen with the tip likely within the stomach, although the mid portion of the tube is not well visualized on the current examination. Therefore, followup imaging would be advised. Left subclavian PICC line unchanged in position with its tip in the distal SVC. 2. Heart remains enlarged. Improving mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with likely layering effusions and associated patchy opacities which may reflect compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pneumothorax. Status post median sternotomy.
