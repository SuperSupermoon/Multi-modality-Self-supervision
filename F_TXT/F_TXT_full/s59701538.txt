In comparison with study of ___, the Dobbhoff tube extends well into the stomach where it is lost to view. It then is seen again with the tip overlying the greater curvature. It is unclear whether the tube is simply coiled in the lower stomach and returning truly to the greater curvature, or whether it could possibly extend well through the duodenum and at the level of the ligament of Treitz. A view of the lower portion of the abdomen would be necessary to make this distinction. As on the study of ___, there is extensive opacification in the right hemithorax consistent with large pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. The left lung is essentially clear.
