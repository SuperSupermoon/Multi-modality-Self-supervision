Single portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral interstitial markings with cephalization of vessels and central vascular engorgement. Obscuration of bilateral diaphragmatic angles may represent bilateral small pleural effusions, although a component of atelectasis or a consolidation cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is enlarged. Visualized osseous structures are without acute abnormality.
