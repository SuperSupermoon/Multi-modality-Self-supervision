In comparison with the study ___ ___, there has been placement of a Dobhoff tube that extends just beyond the level of the esophagogastric junction. It should be pushed forward at least several cm. The lateral aspect of the left hemidiaphragm has been excluded from the image, so that the area of opacification seen previously in this region cannot be assessed. Otherwise little change.
