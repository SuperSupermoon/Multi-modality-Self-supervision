AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Heart size top normal, pulmonary vasculature minimally congested. Mild peribronchial opacification right lower lobe. Findings most likely due to mild atelectasis. No good evidence for pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Pleural effusion minimal on the left if any. No pneumothorax. Catheter projecting over the midline has the appearance of an epidural infusion catheter, but I cannot be sure what it is.
