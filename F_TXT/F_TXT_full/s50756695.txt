Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a largely stable appearance of numerous pleural metastases, right greater than left. There is no definite effusion, there is no pneumothorax. The heart remains markedly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are notable for thickening of the right paratracheal stripe, which is likely vascular. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is minimal atelectasis which is stable in appearance in the left lower lung.
