Comparison is made to the prior study performed 4 hours earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Right lower lobe atelectasis has minimally increased. Right basal chest tube remains in place. Right apical chest tube has been removed. As mentioned in prior studies, the presence of a deep sulcus sign suggests the presence of a right pneumothorax. This is unchanged from prior studies. There are no acute interval changes from recent prior study.
