A new pigtail catheter projects over the right mid to lower lung. Increased rightward midline shift of the trachea and mediastinum suggests interval decrease in the size of a large right pleural effusion causing near complete opacification of the right lung without compensatory re-expansion of the right lung. Right upper lung aeration is slightly increased. There is no pneumothorax. The left lung remains clear.
