Interval removal of a lateral right chest tube. In the location of the previously coiled pigtail catheter, there is pleural thickening, possibly loculated effusion. Additional right chest tube is unchanged in position. Small, dependent right pleural effusion is minimally increased. Trace left pleural effusion is likely unchanged. No pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal. A left PICC terminates in the lower SVC, near the cavoatrial junction.
