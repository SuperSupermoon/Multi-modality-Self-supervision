AP chest compared to ___: Bibasilar consolidation, which developed over the preceding two days, has not cleared. Transient improvement in pulmonary edema and mediastinal vascular engorgement has worsened slightly. Severe cardiomegaly persists and pleural effusions are presumed, perhaps larger today than yesterday. There is no pneumothorax. With the chin down, ET tube position is acceptable. Left internal jugular line passes as far as the left brachiocephalic vein. Transvenous pacer lead follows the expected course to the right ventricular apex. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is longstanding. There is no pneumothorax. Aortic endograft has not migrated from its position in the arch and descending aorta.
