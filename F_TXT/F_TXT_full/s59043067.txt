AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in semi-erect position. Apparently, the patient is status post recent VATS procedure on the left side with a left-sided chest tube advanced from the lower lateral chest wall and reaching the apical area. The lung remains aerated and the previously identified pulmonary parenchymal and apparently pleural abnormalities in the left hemithorax have regressed. Portable single view chest examination does not allow further detailed evaluation. The right hemithorax remains unremarkable. No pneumothorax is seen on either side short of the space that accommodates the apical portion of the left-sided chest tube.
