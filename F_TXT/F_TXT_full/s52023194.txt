ET tube is in adequate position. The distal end of the NG tube is hard to assess on this chest x-ray. Moderate interstitial edema is unchanged. The lung volumes are low and there is increased opacity at the left lung base, which could reflect atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia. Pleural effusions are small if any. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate cardiac contour enlargement is stable.
