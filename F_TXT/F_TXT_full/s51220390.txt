The tip of the endotracheal tube is low and is pointing towards the right mainstem bronchus, 1 cm above the carina. This could be pulled back 2-3 cm for more optimal placement. The feeding tube is too high with the sideport above the GE junction. This could be advanced ___-15 cm for more optimal placement. There is a left IJ central line with the distal lead tip in the mid SVC, unchanged. Heart size is within normal limits. There is a left retrocardiac opacity. Small bilateral effusions are seen.
