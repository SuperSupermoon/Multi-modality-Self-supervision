Right-sided pacer remains in place with leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. There is worsening bilateral airspace and perihilar vascular congestion, consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. There are increasing bilateral layering effusions. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning. Several of the superior sternal wires are fractured, but unchanged. No pneumothorax is seen. Severe degenerative changes are seen of an incompletely visualized left glenohumeral joint, where there is also flattening of the humeral head which may represent a component of avascular necrosis. Clinical correlation is advised.
