Previous median sternotomy noted. A dual lead pacemaker is in-situ, unchanged in appearance. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC. There are bilateral pleural effusions, N there appears to be in a slight increase in the right-sided pleural effusion. Calcified pleural plaques are again noted. There is mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild congestive heart failure but no frank pulmonary edema. Left lower lobe atelectasis. No pneumothorax seen.
