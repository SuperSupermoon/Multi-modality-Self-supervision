Pulmonary vascular congestion is new. I am not convinced this is due to heart failure since heart is not enlarged, and there is no appreciable pleural effusion. Lung volumes are lower producing moderate bibasilar atelectasis, but there may be even greater opacification at the lung bases, particular the left, so I would not exclude aspiration.
