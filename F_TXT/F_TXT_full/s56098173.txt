There has been interval placement of a left chest wall dual lead pacemaker, with leads projecting over the expected locations of the right atrium and right ventricle. The lungs are normally expanded and grossly clear. Heart size is normal. The thoracic aorta is tortuous. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a mildly displaced, unchanged right seventh lateral rib fracture. Calcified densities projecting over the left scapula and inferior glenohumeral joint are unchanged, likely degenerative or posttraumatic.
