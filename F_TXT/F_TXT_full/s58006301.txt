Left-sided chest tube is seen with pigtail projecting over the left lower lung field. A residual small to moderate sized left-sided pneumothorax is present, with resolution of the previously seen signs of tension. The left lung has re-expanded, with streaky left basilar opacities possibly reflecting residual atelectasis. Right lung is clear. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal is size and location, with resolution of the previously seen rightward shift.
