A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained. The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. Given this, no large pleural effusion is seen. Right basilar opacity is not optimally assessed and could be due to atelectasis/scarring, although underlying consolidation or aspiration is not excluded. The left lung is clear. The patient is rotated slightly to the right. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen.
