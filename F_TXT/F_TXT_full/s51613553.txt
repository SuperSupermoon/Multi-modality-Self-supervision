Single supine portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated to the right. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. No definite focal consolidation is seen. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is improved. Patchy opacity at the left lung base is seen; nonspecific, but could be due to infection or aspiration. Dedicated PA and lateral views if and when patient able, would be helpful for further evaluation. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
