AP chest compared to ___ 9:07 p.m.: ET tube has been re-positioned in standard placement. Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Left PICC line ends in the mid SVC. The right lung is quite low in volume, and there is greater peribronchial opacification in the lower lungs, but this is not a pattern of ARDS. It is instead worsening atelectasis and possible spillover pneumonia from the severe consolidation in the left lung. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion not significant if any. No pneumothorax.
