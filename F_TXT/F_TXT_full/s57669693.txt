In compares to the previous study of 1 day earlier, marked cardiomegaly is accompanied by overall improvement in extent of pulmonary edema. Confluent opacities at the lung bases probably reflect dependent edema, but aspiration is an additional consideration. Additionally, a heterogeneous opacity has developed in the periphery of the right upper lobe, and short-term followup radiographs are suggested after diuresis to help differentiate asymmetrical edema from the pulmonary infection.
