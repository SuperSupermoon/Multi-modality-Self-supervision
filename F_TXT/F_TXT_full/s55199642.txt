AP chest compared to ___: Right upper pleural tube unchanged in position. Small right pneumothorax is predominantly lateral and inferior. Tube function should be evaluated to see if it is fissural. Consolidation in the right lower lung has been stable since thoracentesis. Whether this is re-expansion edema, residual atelectasis, or primary pulmonary pathology is radiographically indeterminate at this stage. Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged. No pulmonary edema.
