Lung volumes are low with bronchovascular crowding. A right pleural effusion is probably moderate in size. There is likely associated compressive atelectasis. No evidence of the left pleural effusion. Opacity in the right lower lobe of consolidation is again seen. Heart size cannot be accurately assessed on this single AP view and low lung volumes, probably normal. No edema or pneumothorax. Asymmetric right apical pleural thickening with an apical opacity/mass is better appreciated on the prior CT.
