Single portable view of the chest. Right-sided central venous catheter is seen with tip likely in the right atrium. Lung volumes are relatively low. There are bilateral interstitial opacities similar to prior suggesting pulmonary edema. There may be a small right-sided pleural effusion with blunting of lateral costophrenic angle. More dense retrocardiac opacity seen. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips again seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess given rotation and left base opacity.
