Portable semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates interval withdrawal of an endotracheal tube which is now seen within the mid trachea, 4.5 cm from the carina. Lung volumes are low, with slight interval increase in bibasilar atelectasis and retrocardiac opacity. Bilateral effusions are small, if any. Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous gas in the shoulder girdle and up the neck demonstrates interval resorption. An NG tube is in place with its tip and sidehole within the stomach. There is mild pulmonary edema.
