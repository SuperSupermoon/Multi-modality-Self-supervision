Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion. Confluent area of airspace opacity in the right mid and lower lung has slightly improved, and could reflect pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Asymmetrical edema is an additional consideration. Dense left retrocardiac opacity is unchanged. Small left and moderate right pleural effusions are also noted.
