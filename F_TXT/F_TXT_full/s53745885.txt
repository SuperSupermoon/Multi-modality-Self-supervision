Interval placement of a right-sided chest tube with tip terminating in the left costophrenic angle. Lung appears to have re-expanded with no pneumothorax identified. Leftsided subcutaneous gas identis stable. Faint opacifications in the left lung correspond with areas of atelectasis and contusion, better assessed on the concurrent CT. Endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles. Nasogastric tube passes below the left hemidiaphragm and out of view. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Right lung is clear.
