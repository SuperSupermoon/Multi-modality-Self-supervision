As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. There is constant size of the cardiac silhouette and constant position of the left pectoral pacemaker. Mild peribronchial cuffing and an increase in diameter of the pulmonary vasculature might indicate mild pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
