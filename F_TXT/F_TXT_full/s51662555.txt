In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again seen, increasing the apparent transverse diameter of the mildly elevated heart. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications is probably related to pulmonary vascular congestion, though it would be difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Right IJ catheter is unchanged. There has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends at least to the esophagogastric junction, where it crosses the lower margin of the image. An abdominal film could be obtained if the precise position of the tip of the enteric tube is required.
