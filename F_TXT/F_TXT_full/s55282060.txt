1. Right internal jugular central line with its tip in the proximal to mid SVC. Right subclavian central line has tip in the distal SVC. The left-sided pacer has its leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. Feeding tube continues to have its tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach. There are worsening bilateral patchy perihilar and more peripheral airspace opacities, right greater than left, with associated increase in bilateral layering effusions. These findings may represent moderate-to-severe worsening pulmonary edema, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours given differences in patient positioning. No pneumothorax.
