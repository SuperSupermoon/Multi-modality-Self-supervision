The patient remains intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6 cm above the carina, as before. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its distal course not imaged, below the inferior margin of the film. A left-sided PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There is persistent confluent retrocardiac opacification with a small or perhaps small-to-moderate layering pleural effusion. Allowing for small differences in technique, findings are probably unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
