AP chest compared to chest radiographs since ___: On ___, 2:10 p.m., the patient was in moderately severe pulmonary edema and showed substantial increase in apparent heart size relative to ___, some of which was due to pericardial effusion. Today, heart size is smaller and there is no longer mediastinal vascular engorgement, but there is very mild interstitial edema and small right pleural effusion. The moderate size, posttraumatic left pleural effusion, has changed in distribution, not volume, with a large component in the left major fissure. The base of the left lung is still airless. Unfortunately, without intervening chest radiographs over the past 10 days, there is no way to know whether the current mild interstitial edema is residual, and improved, or recurring.
