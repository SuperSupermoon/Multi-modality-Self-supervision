Compared with ___, the overall appearance is similar. Again seen are extensive opacities throughout both lungs, with a somewhat nodular configuration, but with extensive confluence. The configuration the be subtly different compared with the earlier study, with slight lead more aeration visible at the right lung base particularly laterally. No pneumothorax is detected. These opacities obscure the cardiac silhouette. The trachea and carina remain midline. Lung volumes are low. Possible minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle again seen of the left hemidiaphragm is slightly tented. Sutures overlying the left lung base are again noted. Right upper quadrant surgical clips incidentally noted.
