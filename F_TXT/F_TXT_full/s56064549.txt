A portable frontal semi upright chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the upper thoracic trachea, enteric tube extending below the left hemidiaphragm, and a left chest wall pacer device with the lead overlying the right ventricle. The heart remains enlarged. Bilateral pulmonary opacities are compatible with pulmonary edema, similar to mildly increased. However superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. There is no appreciable pneumothorax or displaced rib fracture. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
