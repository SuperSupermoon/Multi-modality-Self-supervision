Heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted at the lung apices. There is no frank pulmonary edema, though there may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis. Infection cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Marked degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are noted with a high riding right humerus suggestive of rotator cuff disease.
