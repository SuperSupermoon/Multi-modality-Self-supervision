A single portable AP semi-erect view of the chest was obtained. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is chronic. Low lung volumes accentuate the pulmonary vasculature. There is no pulmonary edema. Allowing for low lung volumes, no definite focal consolidation or large effusion. Apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely in part due to the portable technique and the low lung volumes. Mediastinal contour is grossly unremarkable. Linear basilar opacities likely represent atelectasis. A fracture is noted through the neck of the right humeral, which also demonstrates evidence of previous rotator cuff repair.
