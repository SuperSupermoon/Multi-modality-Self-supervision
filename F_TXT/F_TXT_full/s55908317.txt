Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study. The trachea is central. The heart remains enlarged. There is persistent enlargement of the bilateral hila and upper lobe pulmonary vasculature, in addition there is perihilar airspace opacity consistent with pulmonary edema. This is slightly more prominent than on the prior study. Left lower lobe atelectasis. No definite pleural effusion seen. No pneumothorax seen.
