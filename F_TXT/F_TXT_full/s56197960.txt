Since the prior radiograph, there has been interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube that terminates in a branch of the right bronchial tree. There are no other significant changes. Left retrocardiac opacity is likely due to pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, but there may also be residual consolidation from recent pneumonia. No pneumothorax. Stable cardiomegaly.
