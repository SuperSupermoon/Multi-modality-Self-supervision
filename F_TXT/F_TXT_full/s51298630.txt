Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.3 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the stomach. There are low lung volumes and mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Basilar atelectasis is seen. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle is nonspecific, but trace pleural effusion is not excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are likely slightly accentuated by semi-supine AP portable technique and low lung volumes. No overt pulmonary edema.
