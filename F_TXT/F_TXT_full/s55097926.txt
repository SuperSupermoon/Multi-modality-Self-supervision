Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from ___. The lungs are clear of consolidation. Blunting of the left lateral costophrenic angle could be due to small effusion or pleural thickening/scarring. Calcified left apical granuloma is again noted as well as calcified AP window nodes. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but not significantly changed. The trachea is deviated to the left at the thoracic inlet raising possibility of underlying enlargement of a thyroid on the right. Degenerative change is noted at the acromioclavicular joint and posterior upper right rib fractures are again noted.
