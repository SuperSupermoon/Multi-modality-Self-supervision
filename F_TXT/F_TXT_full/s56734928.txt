There is stable blunting of the left costophrenic angle with minimal associated patchy opacity likely reflecting atelectasis. Streaky opacities in the right lung base also likely reflect atelectasis or scarring. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No new airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Heart remains stably enlarged. Aorta is calcified consistent with atherosclerosis. No pneumothorax. Lungs appear somewhat hyperinflated which may reflect underlying emphysema.
