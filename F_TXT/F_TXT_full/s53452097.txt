AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The right pigtail catheter is in place. The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. The left internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. There is unchanged appearance of left basal opacity most likely consistent of combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Right middle lobe partial atelectasis is re-demonstrated. No pneumothorax is seen.
