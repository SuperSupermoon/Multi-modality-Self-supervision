As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of right-sided pleural fluid, reflecting a right hemothorax, has minimally increased. As a consequence, the areas of atelectasis at the right lung bases and in the mid right lung are also more extensive than on the previous image. The extent of the known right pneumothorax has minimally decreased. At the lung apex, the pneumothorax is now approximately 5 mm in diameter. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Retrocardiac atelectasis, otherwise normal appearance of the left lung.
