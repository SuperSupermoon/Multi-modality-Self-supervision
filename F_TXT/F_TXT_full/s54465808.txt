In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, multifocal pulmonary opacities have decreased in extent, particularly in the right upper lobe. However, new opacities have developed in the right juxta hilar and left retrocardiac region, potentially due to new sites of aspiration. Left hemidiaphragm demonstrates further elevation. No other relevant change.
