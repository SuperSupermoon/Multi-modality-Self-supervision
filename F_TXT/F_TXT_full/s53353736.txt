New left PICC terminates within the mid superior vena cava. Pre-existing right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the proximal to mid superior vena cava just above this level. Stable cardiomegaly, but slight improvement in the mid and lower lung interstitial pattern which likely represents improving interstitial edema. Multifocal areas of linear atelectasis persist in the lung bases, and small pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
