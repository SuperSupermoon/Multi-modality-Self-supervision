There is persistent but improving mild interstitial edema. More focal opacity in the retrocardiac region is seen with an associated effusion most likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. A smaller right effusion is also present. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
