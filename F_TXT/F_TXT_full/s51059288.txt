Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Lungs are essentially clear aside from mild bibasilar atelectasis. I do not see evidence of pneumonia on chest imaging over the past 12 days. Small left pleural effusion is new or newly apparent. Previous pulmonary vascular engorgement and suggestion of mild edema on prior chest CT are no longer present. Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. An endotracheal tube ends at the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 7 cm from the carina. Standard placement is a usually between 4 and 5 cm from the carina, but that positioning may be difficult in the setting this patient's large goiter.
