Enteric tube is in appropriate position. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the level the carina. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There appears to be mild right infrahilar bronchial thickening. Subtle opacity at the medial right lower lung may be due to overlap of vascular structures and atelectasis however, developing consolidation possibly due to infection or pneumonia and could be present. Attention at followup. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
