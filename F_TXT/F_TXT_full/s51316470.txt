Nearly complete opacification of the left hemithorax is of increasing density since the recent prior CT. A large area of opacity in the inferior segment of the right upper lobe as well as more patchy right middle lobe involvement were better assessed in recent chest CT from ___ and similar in appearance allowing for difference in techniques. Widespread opacification of the left mid to lower lung is increasingly dense, however. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
