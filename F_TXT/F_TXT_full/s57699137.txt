1. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 4.5 to 5 cm above the carina. A left subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. Pneumoperitoneum is less visible due to semi-upright technique, but persists. Clinical correlation is advised. There is increasing airspace disease within the left upper and mid lung, which is asymmetric from the contralateral side. Although this may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, pneumonia should also be considered. There is persisting consolidation in the retrocardiac region which may reflect lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration could also have this appearance. A left pleural catheter in the costophrenic angle is again seen with no evidence of pneumothorax. There is patchy opacity at the right base, which could reflect an area of edema, atelectasis or pneumonia. There is likely a small right effusion. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged status post median sternotomy for CABG.
