Patient status post right lower lobe wedge resection. There is been interval placement of a chest tube around the right apex. Small opacity in the right lateral base, in the region of previously-seen 8 mm subpleural nodule in CT from ___ and likely represents hematoma. Minimal left basal atelectasis is seen. Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal silhouette have appropriate postop appearance. Left-sided PICC terminates in the right atrium, unchanged from prior. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
