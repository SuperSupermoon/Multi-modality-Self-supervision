Consistent with the given history, an endotracheal tube is present approximately 5.6 cm from the carina. A presumed nasogastric tube has also been placed with its usual course through the mediastinum, coiling in the gastric fundus with the distal tip not visualized. Post-pyloric placement cannot be excluded. The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema. Lung volumes are slightly diminished with elevation of the hemidiaphragms. No consolidation or edema is noted. The mediastinum is unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size. No effusion or pneumothorax is noted on the supine radiograph. No displaced fractures are evident.
