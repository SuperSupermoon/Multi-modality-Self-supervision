A single AP chest view has been obtained with patient in semi-erect position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. As there is report of recently performed left-sided pneumonectomy, increased mediastinal shift towards the left is not surprising. There exists now an empty proportion of the left hemithorax in which a wide caliber chest tube advanced from the left lower lateral chest wall curves around and reaches the area of the posterior inferior pleural sinus. The contour of the left diaphragm is now obscured, but assuming that the left-sided pneumonectomy was total, the diaphragm appears to be elevated and one can identify partially gas-filled structures of the stomach. Pulmonary structures in the right hemithorax remain normal, without signs of congestion, new infiltrates or pleural effusions in the lateral sinus.
