In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is more prominent and there is further engorgement of pulmonary vessels, consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. Similar but less prominent changes are seen at the right base. Suggestion of an area of increased opacification in the left mid lung, though this could primarily be related to the overlying scapula.
