There are low lung volumes, with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Note is made of a large hiatal hernia. Left basilar opacity likely reflects a combination of pleural effusion and consolidation. There is a heterogeneous opacity at the right base. No pneumothorax. Elliptical opacity with a sharp medial margin projects over the right midlung at the level of the seventh posterior interspace, probably pleural loculation or focal pleural thickening.
