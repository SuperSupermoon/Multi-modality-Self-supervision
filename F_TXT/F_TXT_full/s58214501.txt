Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, no significant changes are appreciated. Support devices are appropriately positioned. Lung volumes are low. There are probably left greater than right small pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. No obvious pulmonary vascular congestion. No pulmonary edema. Calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are unchanged.
