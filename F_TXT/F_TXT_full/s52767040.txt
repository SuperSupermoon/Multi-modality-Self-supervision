The right Port-A-Cath tip projects over the expected region of the right atrium, unchanged. Opacity projecting over the left upper hemithorax is new and appears external to the patient, limiting detailed evaluation of underlying structures. Otherwise, no significant interval change. Persistent large right loculated pleural effusion with air-fluid component, consistent with known hydro pneumothorax. Degree of associated compressive atelectasis and adjacent remaining aerated right lung is overall similar. The neoesophagus is noted. A chest tube projects over the right lower hemithorax, unchanged. The appearance of the left lung is unchanged. No left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A colocolonic stent projects over the left upper abdomen, unchanged. Fiduciary marker projecting over the left upper quadrant is also unchanged.
