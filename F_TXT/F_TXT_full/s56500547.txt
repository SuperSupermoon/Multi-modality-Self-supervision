The lungs are minimally hyperinflated. There is substantial volume loss on the right side, which is likely secondary to substantial atelectasis of the middle and lower lobes. Additionally, there are increasing interstitial markings on the right side and the interstitial opacities in the left lung appear worse compared to the prior study, which is concerning for severe atypical pneumonia. There is a rightward shift of the mediastinum and the right hilus is rotated medially. There is a very minimal pulmonary effusion on the right side. Again seen is prominence of the aortic knob and left pulmonary artery.
