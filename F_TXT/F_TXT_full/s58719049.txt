The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The pulmonary architecture is irregular and attenuated, particularly in the right upper lobe, suggesting emphysema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There are patchy new opacities in both lower lungs, more confluent on the right than left side, worrisome for pneumonia, which can have an atypical appearance in the setting of emphysema. The appearance includes a nodular focus projecting over the right lower lung of about a centimeter in diameter, although possibly a nipple shadow superimposed on a background opacification in the lower lungs. Projecting over the medial left lung apex is a newly apparent pleural thickening, which was not seen before and raises potential concern for malignancy at that site. It is noted that the prior radiographs were obtained with a very similar orientation and the opacity appears new.
