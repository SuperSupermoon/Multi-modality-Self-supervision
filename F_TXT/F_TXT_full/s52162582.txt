Compared with prior film, opacity at the right base is slightly more pronounced. This appears to represent a combination of a small effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. More focal opacity at the upper edge of the effusion laterally could represent some pleural fluid or parenchymal opacity. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
