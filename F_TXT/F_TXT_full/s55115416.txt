There is near complete opacification of the left hemithorax, with rightward shift of the mediastinal structures, consistent with large pleural effusion and collapse. A small portion of the left upper lung appears minimally aerated. Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle appears chronic, but may reflect a small amount of pleural effusion. Assessment of the cardiac silhouette is limited. No pneumothorax.
