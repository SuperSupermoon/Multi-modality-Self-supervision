The patient is intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea 4 cm above the level of the carina. An NG tube is seen to pass well below the diaphragm and is curled up in the fundus of the stomach. No pneumothorax is identified. There is considerable cardiac enlargement. The pulmonary vasculature shows significant perivascular haze suggestive of pulmonary congestion. Large pleural effusions can be excluded as the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. Possible patchy infiltrate on right lung base difficult to assess with certainty as vasculature is crowded. Our records do not include a previous chest examination available for comparison.
