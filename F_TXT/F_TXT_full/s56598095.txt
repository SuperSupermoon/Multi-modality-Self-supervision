The patient is significantly rotated to the left in this study. Within these limitations, there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without pulmonary edema and moderate to severe cardiomegaly. Lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation. A rounded soft tissue density projecting over the heart were may be consistent with a hiatal hernia, or less likely an aortic aneurysm. In addition to thoracolumbar scoliosis, there are marked osteopenic and degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine.
