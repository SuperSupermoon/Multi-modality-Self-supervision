Nasogastric tube projects over the stomach and terminates within the stomach. However, the notch of the nasogastric tube appears too proximal and should be advanced 5-10 cm. There is opacification obscuring the left heart border and left hemidiaphragm and leftward mediastinal shift. This is consistent with volume loss and/or pleural effusion with volume loss being the bigger contributor. Right lung is grossly clear. Mediastinal borders and hilar structures are normal.
