As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support devices are constant in appearance, with the exception of a new nasogastric tube. The tube shows a normal course, the tip is positioned in the middle part of the stomach. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The bilateral parenchymal opacities and consolidations show minimally more air bronchograms than on the previous image, but are otherwise, unchanged in extent and severity.
