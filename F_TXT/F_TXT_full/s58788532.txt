Previous small, loculated, right basal pneumothorax has nearly filled with fluid. There is no pleural air elsewhere in the right chest. In the setting of pulmonary vascular congestion the greater opacification in the right lower lung could be dependent edema and atelectasis. More severe consolidation at the left base is long-standing, probably atelectasis or chronic consolidation associated with chronic left pleural effusion. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Overall hyperinflation indicates severe emphysema.
