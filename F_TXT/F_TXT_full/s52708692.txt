A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette. The right lung is fairly well-aerated. The left lung demonstrates decreased aeration and increased pleural effusion. 2 left chest tubes are in place. Of note, the side port of the superior chest tube is extra thoracic, within the soft tissues of the chest wall. There is a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the soft tissues of the left neck. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
