No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison. The heart is not enlarged. No CHF, focal consolidation or effusion is identified. Minimal atelectasis and/or scarring at the left base is suggested. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could represent an early infiltrate, but, without correlative clinical findings, this more likely represents atelectasis. Are there previous outside radiographs for comparison? Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process identified.
