Endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach. There is a right IJ line, extends to the cavoatrial junction. No change in appearance of the lungs, with persistent multifocal parenchymal opacities superimposed on baseline reticular interstitial abnormality suggesting fibrosis. The opacities remain worst at the left base and left mid lung laterally. Small pleural effusions are likely present. There is no pneumothorax.
