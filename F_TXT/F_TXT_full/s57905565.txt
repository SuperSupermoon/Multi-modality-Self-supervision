AP chest compared to ___: Previous pulmonary edema has largely cleared, even though lung volumes are lower. Consolidation at the base of the right lung could be traumatic, atelectasis, or early pneumonia and should be followed. There is no large pleural air or fluid collection. Bilateral thoracostomy tubes and right pleural pigtail drain are unchanged in their respective positions. Endotracheal tube has been repositioned in standard location. Mediastinal contour shows dilatation of the major veins, but no evidence of bleeding, and a normal aortic contour. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and very difficult to assess. Since earlier chest CT showed hemopericardium, the dilatation of mediastinal veins needs to be evaluated clinically to exclude developing tamponade. Dr. ___ ___, paged at 11:30 a.m. when the findings were recognized, discussed them by telephone at 11:35 a.m.
