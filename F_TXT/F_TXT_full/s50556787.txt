A tracheostomy tube has been placed, with the tip of the tube terminating in the proximal intrathoracic trachea, approximately 5.3 cm above the carina. Other indwelling devices are unchanged in position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Persistent large partially layering pleural effusions on this semi-upright study. Diffuse haziness of the upper abdomen suggest the possibility of ascites, and note is made of a new left upper quadrant drainage catheter since the prior radiograph.
