Tip of nasogastric tube terminates within the proximal stomach, but side port is not well visualized and could potentially be proximal to the GE junction. Right PICC terminates within the region of the cavoatrial junction. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, but pulmonary edema has nearly resolved and bilateral retrocardiac opacities are also slightly better. These correspond to dependent airspace opacities on prior CT of ___ and could potentially represent an aspiration pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Right pleural effusion has apparently resolved, and small left pleural effusion is unchanged. Finally, note is made of right upper lobe partial atelectasis with ill-defined right upper lobe opacity accompanied by marked elevation of the right minor fissure.
