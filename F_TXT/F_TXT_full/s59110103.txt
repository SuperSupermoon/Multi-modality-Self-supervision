Interval intubation has occurred with tip of the endotracheal tube low lying, terminating approximately 1.7 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses into the stomach, with tip off the inferior borders of the film. Left-sided AICD device is again noted with leads in unchanged positions. Severe cardiomegaly is again noted. Lung volumes remain low with mild pulmonary vascular congestion re- demonstrated. More focal retrocardiac and right perihilar opacities could reflect atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
