As compared to the previous radiograph, there is worsening massive cardiomegaly. The severity of the pre-existing pulmonary edema has, if any, minimally decreased. The vascular diameters are still enlarged. There is unchanged atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung areas. The presence of minimal pleural effusions cannot be excluded. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
