The heart size is within normal limits. The aorta remains unfolded. Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. A small to moderate size partially loculated right pleural effusion appears increased in size compared to the prior exam. Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect atelectasis, but infection is not excluded. Small left pleural effusion may be present, though assessment of the left costophrenic angle is obscured due to overlying wires. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
