Single portable chest radiograph. Extensive bilateral pulmonary parenchymal opacifications are evident across multiple prior radiographs dating back to ___; however, opacifications appear slightly increased on today's exam, possibly reflecting worsened background pulmonary edema, though superimposed infectious process is not definitively excluded. Stable elevation of right hemidiaphragm. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle appears unchanged, but cannot exclude a small right pleural effusion. Pacemaker leads and sternotomy sutures are intact. No osseous lesion evident.
