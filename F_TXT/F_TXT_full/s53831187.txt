In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes have been removed. Right subclavian catheter remains in satisfactory position. There is persistent opacification in the region of the costophrenic angle on the left. However, the more medial portion of the right hemidiaphragm is quite well seen, suggesting some decrease in the left lower lobe volume loss, possibly related to clearing of a mucus plug. Asymmetry is again seen in the left infrahilar region, consistent with the previous suggestion of consolidation. The right lung is clear with the heart border and hemidiaphragm sharply seen.
