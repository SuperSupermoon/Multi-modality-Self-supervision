Endotracheal tube terminates 5.6 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and inferiorly beyond the film. There is no significant pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. Lung volumes remain low, with bibasilar atelectasis. The diaphragm is not well visualized, and a curvilinear lucency at the right lung base could represent residual aerated lung, colonic interposition, or pneumoperitoneum. Mild cardiomegaly and central venous congestion are unchanged.
