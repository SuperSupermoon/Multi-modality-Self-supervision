In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. The pacemaker device remains in place with leads in the region of the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle. Opacification at the left base is again consistent with some combination of pleural effusion and volume loss in the right lower lobe. Less prominent basilar atelectatic changes are seen on the right. There are some linear opacifications at the right base peripherally, suggestive of Kerley B lines indicating some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
