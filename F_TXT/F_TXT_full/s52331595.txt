In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices have been removed except for the right subclavian catheter that extends to the mid portion of the SVC. The patient has taken a better inspiration. Opacification at the bases most likely represents small pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged. There is continued elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, though less than on the previous study.
