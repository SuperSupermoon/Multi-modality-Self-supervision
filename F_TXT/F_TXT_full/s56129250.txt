Comparison is made to the prior radiographs from ___. There is again seen mediastinal shifting and volume loss on the left side. This appears unchanged. There is increased density at the left base suggestive of collapse of the postoperative left lung as suggested previously. The right lung appears well aerated without signs for overt pulmonary edema, focal consolidation or pleural effusions. There are no pneumothoraces. There is a right-sided central venous line with the distal lead tip in the proximal SVC.
