The lung volumes are very low and unchanged; left lower lobe is poorly aerated. Right lower lung atelectatic band has improved. The patient has been extubated since the previous exam. Right-sided PICC line is either in lower SVC or at cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are top normal. Curvilinear increased density overlying left heart is possibly a calcified mitral annulus.
