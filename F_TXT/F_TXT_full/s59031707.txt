Interval removal of enteric catheter and replacement with a Dobbhoff catheter whose tip is likely in the fundus of the stomach; however, the radiopaque portion is within the gastroesophageal junction and recommend advancing several centimeters. Endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina. Right-sided central venous catheter terminates in the right upper atrium. There is stable extensive perihilar opacification, consistent with pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacifications are likely a combination of atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions, not significantly changed from prior. Cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
