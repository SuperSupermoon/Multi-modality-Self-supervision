Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 14:16. ET tube and right jugular line are in standard placements respectively. No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. Large right pleural effusion is larger, but may not be related to line placement. Nasogastric drainage tube passes as far as the gastroesophageal junction and out of view. Mild interstitial edema is new. Consolidation at the base of the right lung is appreciably worse, but whether this collapse of the lower lobe, or less likely pneumonia, is radiographically indeterminate.
