Comparison is made with prior study performed eight hours earlier. Small right pneumothorax is unchanged. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and mild vascular congestion are stable. Small bilateral pleural effusions are minimally increased with increasing adjacent bibasilar atelectasis. Right basal pleural catheter is in place.
