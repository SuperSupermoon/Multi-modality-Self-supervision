Extreme left lung base the left costophrenic angle excluded from the film. Again seen is an ET tube, with tip approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present -- although poorly delineated in the lower mediastinum, it likely extends beneath the diaphragm stop, similar to prior. Additional wires and leads overlie the chest. Again seen is cardiomegaly. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There more confluent opacities at left-greater-than-right lung bases, similar to prior. Probable left effusion, though this is not well visualized due to positioning of the film edge. Extreme right costophrenic angle excluded from the film, but no gross right effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
