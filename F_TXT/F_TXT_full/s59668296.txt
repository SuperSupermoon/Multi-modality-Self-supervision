1. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm. A right internal jugular central line has its tip in the right atrium, unchanged. Interval removal of left internal jugular central line. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Lung volumes remain low and there is retrocardiac opacity with likely an associated effusion which is essentially unchanged and most likely represents partial lower lobe atelectasis, although a superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. Crowding of vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema. Vascular stenting is incompletely visualized in the mid abdomen.
