CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 8:13 a.m., the right-sided chest tube has been removed. No definite interval change is identified at this time. A small right effusion and considerable opacification of the right lung is unchanged. No obvious pneumothorax, but in the setting of extensive subcutaneous emphysema, a small pneumothorax might not be appreciated. The left lung is unchanged, with some scattered, predominantly linear, opacities at the left base.
