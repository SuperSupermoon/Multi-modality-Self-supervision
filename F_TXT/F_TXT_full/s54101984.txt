Large right pneumothorax has not decreased since the earlier examination at 11:05 p.m. and I see no radiopaque pleural drainage tube. Marked leftward mediastinal shift and depression of the right hemidiaphragm are strong indications of hemodynamic tension. Lucency projecting over the right upper abdominal quadrant could be a function of pleural air, but will need to be followed to see if there might be pneumoperitoneum. ET tube, left internal jugular line and upper enteric drainage tube is in standard placements respectively.
