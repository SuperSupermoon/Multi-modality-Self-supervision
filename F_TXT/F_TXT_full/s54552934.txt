AP portable semi upright view of the chest. Evaluation limited due to low lung volumes and patients rightward rotation. Cardiomegaly is partially noted. There is no convincing evidence for pneumonia or CHF. No large effusion or pneumothorax. The thoracic aorta is unfolded though mediastinal contour is suboptimally assessed due to patient rotation. No bony injuries.
