There has been a dramatic decrease in size of previously seen left paramediastinal mass from ___. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are now within normal limits. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated, as before. Hyperlucency of the lung apices suggests emphysema. Coarse interstitial lung markings, most pronounced in the right lung base suggest underlying interstitial changes, which appear chronic. There is no large pleural effusion. Evaluation for pneumothorax is limited due to soft tissues of the neck overlying the lung apices. There are multiple rib fractures bilaterally, which appear recent without significant callus formation. Mildly displaced fractures involve the right posterior sixth, seventh and eighth rib. A minimally displaced fracture involve the right lateral ninth rib and possibly a nondisplaced fracture involving the right tenth rib. Nondisplaced fractures of the left eighth and ninth ribs moderately are also noted.
