1. Tracheostomy, nasogastric tube and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged in position in this patient status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable post-operative cardiac and mediastinal contours. The heart remains enlarged. Lung volumes remain low. Overall, there is increasing fullness of the pulmonary vasculature and slight increase in opacity in the right lung as compared to the left. These findings could represent worsening asymmetric pulmonary edema, although an infectious process should also be considered. There are likely small bilateral layering effusions. A calcified nodule of the right lung base is consistent with a granuloma. No pneumothorax.
