Portable upright frontal chest radiograph was obtained. Left chest wall ICD is again noted with leads in proper position and unchanged compared to the prior study. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Lungs demonstrate low volumes with crowding of the vessels centrally and streaky bibasal opacities most consistent with atelectasis. There is no focal area of consolidation. No large effusions or pneumothorax. Sternotomy wires and surgical clips along the midline are also noted.
