A right-sided pigtail catheter is again seen. Little, if any residual right apical pneumothorax is seen at this time. Surgical suture chains are seen along the lateral aspect of the right lung fields. The left lung remains clear. The mediastinum and cardiac silhouettes remain unchanged and within normal limits. Osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
