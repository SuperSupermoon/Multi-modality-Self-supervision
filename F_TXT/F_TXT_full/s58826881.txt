Single AP view of the chest was reviewed. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. Lingular scarring is again noted with left hemidiaphragmatic elevation. Increased opacity at the right lung base likely reflects minimal atelectasis. Right total shoulder arthroplasty is again noted. There is no free air under the diaphragm.
