The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are unremarkable and stable since the prior examination. The aorta is tortuous. Linear left basilar opacity is noted, which likely represents atelectasis. In addition, a new right infrahilar opacity is noted, which may represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Again seen is a right sided PICC line terminating in the lower SVC.
