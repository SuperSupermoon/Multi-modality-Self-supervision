AP chest compared to ___: Pulmonary edema improved ___ through ___, but severe cardiomegaly and marked pulmonary vascular congestion persists. Much of the left lower lobe is obscured by the large heart. There is new region of heterogeneous opacity in the axillary portion of the left upper lobe and a suggestion of recurrent edema on the right, in the mid and lower lung zones. Although I cannot exclude pneumonia in the left mid lung, mild pulmonary edema is the simplest explanation, particularly if the patient spends any time in the left decubitus position: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, increased on the right since ___ is additional evidence of cardiac decompensation.
