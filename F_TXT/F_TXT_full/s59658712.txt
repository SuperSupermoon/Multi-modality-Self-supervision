In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes, which accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. At the left base, there is opacification silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable small effusion. Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
