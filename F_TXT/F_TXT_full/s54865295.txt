In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with vascular congestion and large pleural effusions, more prominent on the left with underlying substantial compressive atelectasis. Dual-channel dialysis catheter remains in place. There has been insertion of a left subclavian catheter. The tip of this is difficult to evaluate because it is superimposed on the dialysis catheter. It definitely extends at least to the lower portion of the SVC. To more precisely demonstrate the tip of this catheter, oblique views would be necessary.
