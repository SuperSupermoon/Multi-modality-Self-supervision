In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little change in the appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. However, there is a increased engorgement and distinctness of pulmonary vessels, consistent with worsening pulmonary edema. The left hemidiaphragm is no longer well seen, consistent with the development of pleural fluid and volume loss at the left base. The tip of the Dobhoff tube is in the mid body of the stomach. Given the extensive pulmonary changes, in the appropriate clinical setting it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
