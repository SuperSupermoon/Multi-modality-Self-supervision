Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5.5 cm from the carina. Left subclavian central venous line unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged. Low lung volumes with crowding of the vasculature and no overt pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities at the left base likely reflect atelectasis. No large effusions. No obvious pneumothorax.
