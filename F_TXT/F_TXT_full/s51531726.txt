There are low lung volumes. The right lung is clear. A dense retrocardiac opacity suggests left lower lobe atelectasis. Linear opacities across the left lung field represent discoid atelectasis, but no new confluent consolidations are noted in the left lung. The heart size is top normal, although assessment is limited in this AP radiograph. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Again seen is a Port-A-Cath catheter with the tip ending at the level of the lower SVC. There is no evidence of abdominal free air.
