As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not included in the image. There are now signs of mild pulmonary edema. In addition, a relatively large left lower lobe atelectasis is present. Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus suggests the presence of a small pleural effusion. The known lateral rib fractures are not appreciated on the radiograph.
