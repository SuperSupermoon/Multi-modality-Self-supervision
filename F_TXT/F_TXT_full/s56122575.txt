Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is persistent diffuse increased interstitial markings bilaterally, consistent with patient's history of pulmonary fibrosis/chronic lung disease. There is persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which could be due to trace pleural effusion and/or pleural thickening. Underlying left base consolidation is difficult to exclude. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.
