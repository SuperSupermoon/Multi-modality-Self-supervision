AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. A Dobbhoff line has been placed which is seen to reach into the stomach, however, reverses and its tip points in retrograde direction, reaching the level of the upper thorax where the level of termination coincides with that of the tracheal cannula. No pneumothorax or any other placement-related complication is identified. There is no evidence of pneumothorax, but similar as seen on the previous examination marked pulmonary congestion and basal pleural effusions are noted.
