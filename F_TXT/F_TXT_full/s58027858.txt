AP chest compared to ___, 3:15 p.m.: Previous small left pleural effusion is no longer present. Because of the extensive asbestos-related pleural calcification, I cannot exclude small pneumothorax, but there does not appear to be any change in the orientation of pleural calcifications to the perimeter of the left hemithorax. Heart size is top normal. Lungs are generally obscured by pleural calcification.
