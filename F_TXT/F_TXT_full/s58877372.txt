In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the PICC line is somewhat difficult to see, though it appears to be at the mid portion of the SVC. Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal in patient with previous CABG and intact midline sternal wires. Pulmonary vascularity may be minimally enlarged, less than on the previous study. No acute focal pneumonia.
