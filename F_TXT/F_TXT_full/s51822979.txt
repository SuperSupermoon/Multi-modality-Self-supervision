The cardiac silhouette appears slightly decreased in size with improvement of central pulmonary vascular engorgement. A small layering left effusion is unchanged and there is slightly increased layering right pleural effusion. A left apical chest tube remains in place without appreciable pneumothorax. There is no focal consolidation worrisome for pneumonia. A left internal jugular central venous catheter, endotracheal tube and upper enteric tube remain in unchanged position. Multiple contiguous left sided rib fractures are again noted.
