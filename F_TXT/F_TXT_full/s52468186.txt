Lung volumes are low and there is again mild relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, somewhat increased. The right costophrenic angle is difficult to assess and a small pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. Increased opacity is present at the left lung base although probably compatible with atelectasis.
