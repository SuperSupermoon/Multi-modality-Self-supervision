Lung volumes are low, making it difficult to distinguish bibasilar opacification due to atelectasis from pneumonia or aspiration. I would recommend followup with conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs, when feasible. The upper lungs are clear. There is no pulmonary edema. Heart is normal size and there is no pleural abnormality.
