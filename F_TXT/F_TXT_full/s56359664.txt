Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the patient in semi-upright position. The Dobbhoff tube has been pulled back with the tip projecting over the antrum of the stomach. The distal portion of the tubing is sharply bent. The lungs are fully expanded and clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
