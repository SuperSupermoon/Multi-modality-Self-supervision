There has been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube with tip terminating near the left apex. There has been re-expansion of the left lung, with only a minimal residual amount of the pneumothorax seen in the left apex. Streaky linear opacity in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis. Previously noted rightward shift of mediastinal structures has resolved. The right lung is clear. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. No acute osseous abnormalities are identified. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus may suggest a small left pleural effusion.
