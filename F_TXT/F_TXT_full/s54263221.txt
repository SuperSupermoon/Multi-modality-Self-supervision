There has been interval removal of the chest tube with no left pneumothorax is appreciated. However, there is a lobulated contour to the right apex which may reflect a small right apical pneumothorax. This can be better assessed on followup imaging. The lungs demonstrate parenchymal distortion and hyperinflation consistent with underlying emphysema. There are small bilateral effusions. Linear opacities at the left base likely reflect scarring. More focal patchy opacity at the right base is unchanged but raises concern for pneumonia or aspiration, less likely atelectasis given the asymmetry. Clinical correlation is advised. No pulmonary edema. Status post aortic valve replacement with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.
