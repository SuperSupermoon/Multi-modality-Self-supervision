Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right subclavian central line unchanged in position. Lung volumes are somewhat low with bibasilar patchy opacities which could reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. The vasculature appears cephalized consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension but no overt pulmonary edema is appreciated. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
