Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates an ETT tip terminating approximately 5 cm above the carina. The transesophageal tube side port terminates near the GE junction. Bilateral patchy opacities are noted, worse on the left than on the right, in the appropriate clinical context, possibly related to possibly aspiration, multifocal pneumonia, hemorrhage. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
