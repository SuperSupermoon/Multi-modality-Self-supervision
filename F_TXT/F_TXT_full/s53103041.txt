Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiac size is top normal, is accentuated by low lung volumes. Right lower lobe opacity has minimally increased. As mentioned before, this is worrisome for aspiration. There is no pneumothorax. Of note, the right lateral CP angle was not included on the film. NG tube is just distal to the GE junction and should be advanced for standard position.
