AP chest compared to ___ through ___: There has not been much change since ___ including bilateral pleural effusion, moderate on the right, smaller on the left, and moderate cardiomegaly. Enlargement and lobulation of the right hilus could all be vascular. Dense consolidation in the right lower lobe is either atelectasis or, less likely pneumonia. There are no chest CT scans uploaded to PACS, despite the designations of several chest radiographs and CT scans. Chest CT scanning would be very helpful in determining the diagnoses of these difficult radiographic findings. Upper enteric tube passes into the upper portion of a non-distended stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
