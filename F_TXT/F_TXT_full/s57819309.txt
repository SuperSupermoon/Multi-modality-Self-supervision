Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier. Left IJ catheter tip has been pulled back, now projects at the level of the aortic arch, still does not crosses the midline towards the right. It is located likely in a left-sided mediastinal vein or a duplicated left SVC, readjustment is recommended. There are no other interval changes.
