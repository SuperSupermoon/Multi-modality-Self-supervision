Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate interval improvement in the pneumothorax. The right side is completely resolved. There is a small amount of left-sided pneumothorax remaining. There is no pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Low lung volumes are seen and likely are responsible for vascular crowding that is visualized.
