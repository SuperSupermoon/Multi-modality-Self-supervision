AP chest compared to ___: Moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened since ___. There has been some increase in previous small right pleural effusion. Given these changes, and partial obscuration of the lungs, I cannot say whether pulmonary contusions have worsened. It might be possible to make that judgment with a repeat chest CT scan. Cardiomegaly is severe, but mediastinum, where there was likely pulmonary hematoma, has not widened subsequently. No pneumothorax. ET tube in standard placement. A feeding tube passes into the stomach. There is also an esophageal manometer or a thermometer ending just below the level of the carina. Patient has had median sternotomy and recent aortic valve replacement, as well as aortic endograft, grossly unchanged in postoperative appearance.
