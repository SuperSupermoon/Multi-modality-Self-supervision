In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pulmonary opacifications most likely consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. The opacification at the bases has somewhat decreased. However, this may merely reflect a more upright position of the patient rather than a substantial clearing in the layering pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis.
