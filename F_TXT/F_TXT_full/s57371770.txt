1. Endotracheal tube has its tip 5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 2. Overall, the lung volumes are slightly lower and there is worsening airspace opacity suggestive of progression of the mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. In addition, there is retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis in the setting of layering bilateral effusions. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Costophrenic angles not entirely included on the study.
