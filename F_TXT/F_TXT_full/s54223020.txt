In comparison to the prior radiograph pulmonary edema is nearly resolved. There is an unchanged small right and trace left pleural effusion with associated bibasilar atelectasis worse at the right lung base. Focal opacity in the left mid lung and at the left lung base with apparent air bronchograms is essentially unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
