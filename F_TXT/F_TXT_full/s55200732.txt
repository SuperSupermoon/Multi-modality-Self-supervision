An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, 4.4 cm from the carina. A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged with the tip at the atriocaval junction. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of field of view. It is likely a post-pyloric position. There is improved aeration at the right base, though there are persistent bibasilar opacities, likely representing residual pneumonia. The apices of the lungs are clear. There is no pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Again, subcutaneous air is noted overlying the neck. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
