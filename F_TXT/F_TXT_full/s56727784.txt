Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest were reviewed and compared to the prior studies. A pigtail catheter within the left chest is unchanged in position. Opacity around the left mediastinum and loss of the left mediastinal contours is highly concerning for left lung atelectasis and/or a large left pneumothorax. Opacities in the right lung have decreased, however, right low lung atelectasis persists. A right-sided internal jugular line ends in the low superior vena cava. Evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contour is severely limited; however, they appear grossly unchanged. Again left rib fractures are noted. Subcutaneous air in the left hemithorax is slightly decreased.
