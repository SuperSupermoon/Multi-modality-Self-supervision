Low lung volumes are present. Innumerable nodules are seen within both lungs compatible with diffuse pulmonary metastases, as seen on the prior CT torso. Heart size is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular prominence. The aorta remains tortuous. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged, though there is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. A right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates within the SVC. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is definitively seen.
