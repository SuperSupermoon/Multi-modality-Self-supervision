Right basilar atelectasis and pleural effusion are similar in appearance compared to the prior study. The left lung is essentially clear, with only trace retrocardiac opacity remaining, likely atelectasis. There is no pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or pneumothorax. The heart is mildly enlarged, and surgical clips and prosthetic aortic valve are unchanged.
