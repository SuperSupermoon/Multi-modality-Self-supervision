The patient has been intubated. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube heads into the stomach although its tip lies beyond the confines of the film. A right internal jugular central venous catheter again terminates in the lower superior vena cava. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is probably a small pleural effusion on the right, although not necessarily changed. A diffuse interstitial abnormality is increased suggesting pulmonary edema. In addition, there are nodular opacities and a possible developing focal opacity in the right lower lung.
