Semi-erect frontal view of the chest was obtained. Left PICC terminates in the upper SVC, and tracheostomy and PEG are in stable position. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is compatible with a small left pleural effusion, similar to prior. Retrocardiac opacity is compatible with atelectasis and similar to prior. Right basilar opacity has worsened medially, and a new patchy opacity has developed peripherally at the right lung base. No pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
