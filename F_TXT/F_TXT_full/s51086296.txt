Heart size is normal. Mild calcification of the aortic knob is present. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Hilar contours are unremarkable. Relative lucency within the right lung base likely reflects bullous emphysematous changes. Linear opacities within the left lung base may reflect scarring or subsegmental atelectasis. The patient's forearm obscures visualization of the left costophrenic angle. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
