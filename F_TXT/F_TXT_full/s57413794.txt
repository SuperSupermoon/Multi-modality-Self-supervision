As compared to the previous radiograph, the lower pigtail catheter is in unchanged position. A second, newly inserted left-sided drain projects above the pigtail catheter that was previously in place. A substantial part of the pleural fluid has been drained. The amount of ventilated lung on the left has substantially increased as compared to the previous examination. However, no left-sided pneumothorax is visualized. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant. Minimal atelectasis in the mid right lung. Unchanged right internal jugular vein catheter. The course of the cutaneous staple lines is also unchanged.
