There has been interval removal of a right-sided pigtail pleural catheter. A large loculated right pleural effusion and adjacent pulmonary opacity is not significantly changed from the prior study done today at 03:30. The left lung is hypoinflated but clear. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and possible mild edema.
