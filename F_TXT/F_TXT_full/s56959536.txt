An endotracheal tube is noted terminating within the right mainstem bronchus approximately 1 cm beyond the level of the carina. A ___ tube is seen extending into the stomach, and a right subclavian central venous line terminates near the cavoatrial junction. Low lung volumes are noted, resulting in crowding of the bronchovascular structures. The left lung is diffusely opacified relative to the right, likely secondary to the selective right mainstem intubation. Right infrahilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis, although consolidation cannot be excluded. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. The heart appears mildly enlarged, allowing for portable AP technique. Surgical clips are noted within the right upper quadrant.
