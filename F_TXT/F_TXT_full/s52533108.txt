In comparison to the prior radiograph from 1 day earlier, a Swan-Ganz catheter has changed in position, now coiling within the right atrium before terminating in the right ventricle directed towards the outflow tract. Intra-aortic balloon pump remains in place, with radiodense tip terminating 1.9 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. Exam is otherwise similar to the recent radiograph except for slight worsening of pulmonary edema and slightly improved aeration at the left lung base.
