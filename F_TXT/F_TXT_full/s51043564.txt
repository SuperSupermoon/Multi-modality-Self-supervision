Judging from the correlation of yesterday';s chest radiographs and concurrent chest CTA, there has been no change in large right and moderate left pleural effusion, bilateral lower lobe collapse, and bilateral upper lobe consolidation, predominantly in the anterior segments, with features of scarring. Heart is normal size. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements. Feeding and esophageal drainage tubes pass into the stomach and out of view.
