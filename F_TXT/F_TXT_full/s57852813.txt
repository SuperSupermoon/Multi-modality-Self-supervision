AP chest compared to ___: It is possible that the apparent widening of the right upper mediastinum is due to upper lobe collapse, but it is equally likely due to a new fluid collection in the mediastinum related to the insertion of a right jugular line, either bleeding or extravasation. Heart size is mildly enlarged and unchanged. There is no appreciable right pleural effusion, and appearance of the mediastinum is unchanged since prior to the line insertion, noteworthy for the very large and tortuous thoracic aorta. Very mild interstitial edema is still present. ET tube is in standard position. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach. These findings were discussed yesterday with ___ by telephone at 4 p.m.
