An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip is approximately 4.9 cm above the level the carina. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. There are persistent bilateral patchy airspace opacities, similar in extent when compared to the prior study. This may reflect pulmonary edema or multifocal infection. No definite effusion seen. No pneumothorax seen.
