Opacification of the mid and lower left lung is grossly unchanged from the prior study and better characterized by same day chest CT. Opacity likely represents a combination of lymphangitic carcinomatosis and a small pleural effusion. Superimposed infectious process in the left lung base is possible in the proper clinical setting. The right lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax. The osseous structures are notable for cervical spinal fusion hardware. The upper abdomen is unremarkable.
