Extensive bilateral perihilar consolidative abnormalities developed between ___ and ___ they accompanied chronic moderate to severe cardiomegaly and were therefore attributed to pulmonary edema. The lower lobe components have improved slightly, but the right upper lobe component is still quite severe. I still believe most of the abnormality was due to pulmonary edema but there may be concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. Newly placed ET tube is in standard position, but its diameter, 11 mm, may be smaller than ideal for the caliber of the trachea, 29 mm. Clinical correlation advised. Pleural effusions are small. There is no pneumothorax.
