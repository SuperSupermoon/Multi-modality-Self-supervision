Previous left upper lobe opacity has cleared. The ET tube terminates in appropriate position, and a right IJ central venous line ends in the lower SVC. The gastric tube likely ends at the body of stomach, and the left hemodialysis catheter ends in the mid to upper SVC. Cardiomegaly persists with improving pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable, and no new focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.
