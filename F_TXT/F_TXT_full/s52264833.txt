A right internal jugular line is present with tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction. The ET tube and enteric tube are in stable position. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Bilateral pleural effusions are slightly decreased compared to the prior study. Pulmonary edema is also improved, now mild. Bibasilar consolidations persist and may reflect atelectasis or pneumonia.
