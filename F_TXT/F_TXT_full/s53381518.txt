1. Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. There has been interval placement of a left chest tube with interval appearance of a small left apical pneumothorax. Lung volumes are markedly diminished with crowding of the vasculature and patchy bibasilar opacities most likely reflecting atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to low volumes, patient rotation and portable technique, although the mediastinum does appear somewhat widened. This can be better assessed on followup imaging.
