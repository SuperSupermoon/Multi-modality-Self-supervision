AP chest compared to ___: Largescale consolidation in the right upper and mid and left lower and mid lung zones has been present without appreciable change since ___. Considerable vascular engorgement in the hila, mediastinum and upper lobes has varied minimally from day to day. Heart is normal size. As noted previously, the tracheostomy tube is smaller than expected, and the tip abuts the lateral wall of the trachea. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. No pneumothorax. Right subclavian line ends low in the SVC. Mediastinal contour is widened, without change since ___, but it is impossible to say whether that is due to adjacent atelectasis or adenopathy. I favor atelectasis because there is, if anything, more rightward tracheal shift today than there was in ___ when the contour in the would-be right paratracheal region was not as wide. No pneumothorax.
