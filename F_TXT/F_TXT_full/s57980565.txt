Single portable view of the chest. Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings. Linear opacity at the left lung base most suggestive of atelectasis. Lungs are otherwise clear of confluent consolidation. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted. No free air identified below the diaphragm.
