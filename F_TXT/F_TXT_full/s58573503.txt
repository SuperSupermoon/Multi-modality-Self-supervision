There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube with tip terminating near the apex with interval decrease in the amount of fluid in the right pleural space and improved aeration of the right lung. There is a persistent moderate right hydropneumothorax noted with fluid loculated laterally. There is continued leftward shift of mediastinal structures, not substantially changed. Patchy opacity in the left lung base may reflect worsening atelectasis with a small left pleural effusion. No left-sided pneumothorax is present. No pulmonary vascular engorgement is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are similar.
