Portable frontal semi-erect chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea. Upper sternal wires are fractured and new plating from both sides of what looks like sternal dehiscence. There are low lung volumes, with exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Even allowing for this, there is at least moderate cardiomegaly. Diffuse bilateral opacities consistent with mild pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation or appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.
