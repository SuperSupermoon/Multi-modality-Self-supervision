The cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. There are biapical calcified pleural plaques with biapical reticular nodular opacities, right greater than left, which when correlated with the CT study is consistent with scarring and post-inflammatory changes. A more focal patchy opacity at the right medial lung base could reflect an area of patchy atelectasis or aspiration as no focal airspace consolidation was seen in this vicinity on the CT from ___. There is some blunting of the right costophrenic angle which likely reflects pleural thickening, less likely an effusion given the absence of an effusion on the recent CT. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
