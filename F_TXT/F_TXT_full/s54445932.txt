Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate increased right basilar opacification suggestive of reexpansion pulmonary edema, given the patient's thoracentesis today. The previously visualized pneumothorax is less conspicuous on this exam. Large left pleural effusion is unchanged from prior imaging. The right-sided PICC line and pacer wires appear in the expected positions, unchanged from prior imaging. The cardiomediastinal silhouette cannot be evaluated due to obscuration by pleural effusions.
