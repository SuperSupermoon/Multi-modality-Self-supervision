Left chest tube remains in place with a persistent tiny left apical pneumothorax. Partially loculated left pleural effusion and pleural thickening are similar compared to the recent chest radiograph as are adjacent parenchymal opacities in the left mid and lower lung regions. Patchy and linear atelectasis in the right infrahilar region is also unchanged.
