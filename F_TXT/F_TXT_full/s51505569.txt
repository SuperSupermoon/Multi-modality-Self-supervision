AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The patient is now extubated. The previously existing Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. The sheath has been exchanged over a wire by a right internal jugular route line, the tip of which reaches some 4 cm below the level of the carina in the area of the expected right SVC/atrial junction. Whereas the right-sided chest tube has been removed, the left-sided tube remains in unchanged appropriate position. Heart size has increased slightly postoperatively, but no significant increase of pulmonary congestive pattern or new infiltrates is seen. The previously mentioned metallic structures of a mitral valve prosthesis remain in unchanged position.
