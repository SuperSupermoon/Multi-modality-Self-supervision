As compared to the previous radiograph, there are ongoing massive bilateral opacities of the lung parenchyma, likely reflecting a combination of pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. The changes have minimally increased on the left and are stable on the right. Also stable is the size of the cardiac silhouette. Healed right rib fracture. Subclavian line in unchanged position.
