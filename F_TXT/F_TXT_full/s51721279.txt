ECMO cannula extends from the right internal jugular through the inferior vena cava, as before. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the proximal right pulmonary artery. ET tube is in standard placement. Left internal jugular line ends from the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Pleural effusion if present is small to moderate on the right, minimal on the left. Heart is not enlarged. Right lung volume is smaller than the left, and smaller now than it was at 03:00. Therefore concurrent atelectasis is at least partially responsible for the probe aggressive consolidation of the right lung. Heterogeneous opacification in the left lung though severe, has been relatively stable.
