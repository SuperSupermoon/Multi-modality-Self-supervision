The ETT tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina, in standard position. Lung volumes are slightly low. Bilateral ill-defined as well as confluent air space opacities can be seen with infection or heart failure. Retrocardiac opacity with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm may represent a combination of effusion and/or atelectasis. The heart size is difficult to assess on this portable exam and since the left heart border is obscured. The central pulmonary vessels appear engorged. No pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality.
