In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued improvement in the diffuse bilateral airspace opacities. Again there is some obscuration of the hemidiaphragms consistent with layering pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases. The asymmetric right apical thickening seen previously is difficult to assess due to the area being overlied by the chin of the patient.
