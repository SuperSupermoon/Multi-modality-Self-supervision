As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Minimal improvement of the transparency at the level of the retrocardiac lung areas, likely reflecting decreased left effusion. On the right, the effusion is also minimally decreased. No new parenchymal opacities. No signs of overt pulmonary edema. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
