The lungs are well expanded and show a small right lower lobe opacity. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is present. No definite rib fractures are noted, although if this is of clinical concern, then a dedicated rib series is recommended. A fracture of the left distal clavicle is of uncertain acuity.
