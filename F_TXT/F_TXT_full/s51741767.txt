Lung volumes are low, contributing to vascular crowding. Despite that, there is likely mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged. Small left pleural effusion has slightly increased. Increased retrocardiac airspace opacification may be due to atelectasis or aspiration. There is no pneumothorax.
