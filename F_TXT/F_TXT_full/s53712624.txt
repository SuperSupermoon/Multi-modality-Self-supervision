Seen again is complete collapse of the left lower lobe. As compared to prior examination, the expanded lungs are now somewhat better aerated. The right lung continues to demonstrate mild pulmonary edema with an associated pleural effusion. A small left effusion is stable. The heart size appears to be slightly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable. Two left subclavian catheters are unchanged in position, terminating within the mid SVC. There is no associated pneumothorax.
