A single portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. Lung volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature. Given this limitation, there is no focal consolidation. The heart size is within normal limits. No pleural effusions are seen. There is no pneumothorax. Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.
