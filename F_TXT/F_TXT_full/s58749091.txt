There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. A ~1 cm nodular opacity is identified just superior to the right hilus. There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusions. A convex contour arising from the descending and ascending thoracic aorta appears unchanged compared to prior and corresponds with known aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta. Known aortic valvular calcifications are not well seen on this radiographic examination, though may reflect underlying aortic stenosis. The remainder of the mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
