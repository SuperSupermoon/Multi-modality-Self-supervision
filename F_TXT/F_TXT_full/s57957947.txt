Apparent 2 small right lung nodules at the level of the third anterior rib and interspace and perhaps a third at the level of the right fifth rib is not corroborated on the chest CTA performed 9 hours earlier. These are probably rib lesions and pleural thickening, respectively. There are no findings of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax.
