1. There continues to be a patchy streaky opacity in the left mid lung in a known area of interstitial fibrosis. Overall, it appears to be slightly worse, although this could be related to differences in technique. A superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded.

No evidence of pneumothorax. Clinical correlation is advised and further imaging evaluation with CT at this time should be based on the clinical assessment.
