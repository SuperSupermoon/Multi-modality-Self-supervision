Lung volumes remain low. There is a new airspace opacity at the right lung base consistent with right middle lobe consolidation. In the setting of trauma this may reflect a pulmonary contusion but infection cannot be excluded. There is a small amount free air under both hemidiaphragms. A gastrostomy tube appears to have been placed recently which may account this finding but hollow visceral injury cannot be excluded.
