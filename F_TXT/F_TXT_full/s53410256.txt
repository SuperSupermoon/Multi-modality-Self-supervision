The patient has been extubated. The pulmonary artery catheter has been adjusted and is now in appropriate positioning. There is no change in the sternotomy wires and mediastinal drains. The NG tube has been removed. The lucency outlining the aortic knob is less evident on today's examination and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. There are no focal consolidations. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is a stable postoperative appearance of the mediastinum, without interval widening to suggest hemorrhage. The small left pleural effusion has slightly increased in size.
