As compared to the previous radiograph, the right-sided chest tube has been removed. There currently is no evidence of pneumothorax. The lung volumes have slightly increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. An area of atelectasis is seen at the right lung base, both laterally and medially. A similar area of atelectasis is visible projecting over the left costophrenic sinus. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
