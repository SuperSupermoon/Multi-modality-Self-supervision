The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including mild cardiomegaly and calcification along the aortic arch. The central pulmonary vascularity shows upper zone redistribution with distinct but prominent vessels, similar to prior findings, suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension without congestive heart failure. A small hyperdense nodule projecting over the right mid lung is unchanged and suggests a granuloma. There is similar mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The patient is status post right shoulder hemiarthroplasty. Flattening and sclerosis have progressed along the left humeral head with corresponding effacement of the glenoid appears worse; findings could be seen with a history of avascular necrosis in the appropriate setting.
