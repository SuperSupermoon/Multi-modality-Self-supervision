There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral effusions and trace fluid in the right horizontal fissure. There is likely a small right subpulmonic effusion as well. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Heart size is top normal. A stable calcified left-sided pleural plaque is incidentally noted.
