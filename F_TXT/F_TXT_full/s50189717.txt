Comparison to ___. A previous right internal jugular vein has been removed. The left Port-A-Cath is in stable position. Different positioning of the patient makes a direct comparison difficult but bilateral pleural effusions of mild to moderate extent could have newly appeared. The extensive bilateral mid lung and basal parenchymal opacities appear to be stable.
