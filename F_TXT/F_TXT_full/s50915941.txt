There are low lung volumes. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates diffuse calcifications. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted, though no overt pulmonary edema is visualized. Retrocardiac ill-defined opacity is present with small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified though evaluation of the lung apices is limited due to patient positioning and the patient's chin obscuring the left lung apex.
