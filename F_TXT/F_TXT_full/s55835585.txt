AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size is normal. Mediastinum is slightly widened with minimal deviation of the trachea to the right, findings that potentially may be explained by distention of the aorta or other mediastinal vessels, but assessment with chest CT to exclude the possibility of lymphadenopathy in this area is required. Lungs are essentially clear with no evidence of pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
