Endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There is persistent patchy opacity at the right base which has slightly improved aeration suggesting resolving atelectasis or aspiration pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. The left lung is grossly clear. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
