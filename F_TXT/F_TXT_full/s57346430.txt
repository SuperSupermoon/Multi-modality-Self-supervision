As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of a right pleural effusion with subsequent atelectasis at the right bases. In addition, the effusion on the left has slightly increased in extent and causes increase of the extent of a pre-existing left lower lobe atelectasis and a new plate-like atelectasis at the level of the left hilus. Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is unchanged. Unchanged right internal jugular vein catheter. Unchanged tracheostomy tube.
