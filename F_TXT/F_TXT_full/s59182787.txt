The AP chest radiograph today again demonstrates right upper lobe consolidation abutting the minor fissure. No new consolidation is seen. Left PICC terminates in lower SVC. The descending aorta is tortuous. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
