There is a large, partially loculated right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded. There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle and a trace left pleural effusion may be present. The right aspect of the cardiac silhouette is difficult to accurately assess due to the right side opacity. The aorta appears somewhat tortuous. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
