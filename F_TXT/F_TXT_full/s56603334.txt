As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion is likely to have increased. As a consequence, there is increased atelectasis at the right middle and lower lung zones. There is unchanged evidence of cardiomegaly and a small left pleural effusion as well as a perihilar left atelectatic lung area. The tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position.
