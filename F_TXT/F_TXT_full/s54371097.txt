As compared to the previous radiograph, the signs suggestive of pulmonary emphysema and overinflation are constant in appearance. In the interval, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The pleural effusions have resolved and the lungs are now well expanded. There is a subtle remnant right basal parenchymal opacity, likely to reflect resolving pneumonia. No new parenchymal opacities have appeared. The size of the cardiac silhouette is normal. Skin fold at the right lung apex causes a linear lucency and should not be mistaken for a pneumothorax.
