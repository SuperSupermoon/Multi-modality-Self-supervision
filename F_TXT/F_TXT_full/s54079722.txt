As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices, including the endotracheal tube, are in unchanged position. The pre-existing relatively extensive bilateral basal parenchymal opacities, right slightly more than left, are overall unchanged in extent and severity. No parenchymal opacities have newly occurred. The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No right-sided pleural effusion. Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with minimal tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
