Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient has reported history of prior left lower lobectomy. Severe chronic left pulmonary changes with evidence of volume loss in the left hemithorax persist; however, there is increased opacification projecting over the left hemithorax. Hyperexpansion of the right hemithorax persists. There has been interval development of a large area of consolidation in the right mid lung field. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unable to be assessed due to the left hemithorax opacification. Fixation hardware is noted in the upper lumbar spine, not optimally evaluated.
