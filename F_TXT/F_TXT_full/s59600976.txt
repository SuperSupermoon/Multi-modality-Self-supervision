The feeding tube has been replaced with a nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. There is right lateral pleural thickening likely reflecting a layering pleural effusion which may have some loculated components. There continues to be mild to moderate pulmonary edema, right greater than left, less likely multifocal pneumonia. The left costophrenic angle and left lower lung are not entirely included on this examination. No pneumothorax.
