Single AP frontal view of the chest was obtained. Midline tracheostomy tube is seen. A right-sided PICC is seen terminating at the level of the low SVC. A catheter traverses vertically over the left hemithorax and projects over the abdomen which may represent a VP shunt. Again, there is evidence of minimal pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No focal consolidation is seen.
