In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette remains enlarged with tortuosity of the aorta. Indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels is again consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The left hemidiaphragm is now sharply seen. No evidence of acute focal consolidation. Of incidental note are surgical clips overlying the right lower chest, presumably within breast tissue.
