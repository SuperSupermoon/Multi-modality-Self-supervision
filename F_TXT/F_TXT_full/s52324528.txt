In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the right PICC line is in the mid portion of the SVC. Tracheostomy tube is in place. There are low lung volumes. Opacification in the retrocardiac region and costophrenic angle is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. There is a thin opacification projected over the right hemidiaphragm, which could be a manifestation of asbestos-related disease.
