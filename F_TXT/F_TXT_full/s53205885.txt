Patient position is not specified. The patient is rotated rightward, if the patient is also supine, that would explain enlargement of the right hilus. Mild volume loss in the right lung and possible asymmetry in the extent of peripheral vascularity need to be verified with carefully positioned radiographs to see if imaging possible pulmonary embolus is indicated. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise normal. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
