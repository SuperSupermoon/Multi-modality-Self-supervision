Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. One of the right chest tubes has been removed. There is still a right apical chest tube. There is no evident pneumothorax. Increased opacity in the right lower lobe is consistent with increase in atelectasis and small-to-moderate right pleural effusion. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is grossly unchanged. Bibasilar atelectases have increased on the right. Extensive subcutaneous air in the right chest wall is unchanged. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
