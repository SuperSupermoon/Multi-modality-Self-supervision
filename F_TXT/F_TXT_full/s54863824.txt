There is persistent small to moderate right pleural effusion with some associated patchy airspace to disease at the right base likely reflecting atelectasis. A right apical lucency raises the possibility of a tiny right apical pneumothorax, although the patient reportedly has not had recent thoracentesis. Clinical correlation is recommended and follow up imaging may be helpful. Lung volumes are low. Interval improvement but residual mild perihilar edema. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
