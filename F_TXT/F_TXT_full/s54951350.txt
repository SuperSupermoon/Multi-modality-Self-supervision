Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy. There are low lung volumes. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to a trace effusion. Subtle bilateral patchy opacities may relate to infection versus mild volume overload. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No pneumothorax.
