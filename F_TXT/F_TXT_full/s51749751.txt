Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is no interval change. There are again seen airspace opacities, more confluent in the lung bases and on the right side greater than the left side. There is a right IJ central line with distal lead tip in the mid to distal right atrium. This could be pulled back 3 to 4 cm for more optimal placement. There are no pneumothoraces. No large pleural effusions are present. Overall, there is no interval change.
