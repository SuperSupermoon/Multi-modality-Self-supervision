As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, trace right apical pneumothorax remains. Lung volumes remain low. There are persistent right multilobar opacities and there is pulmonary congestion. Loss of the left hemidiaphragm could be related to a small pleural effusion and volume loss. Retrocardiac air bronchograms could represent pneumonia. Heart is enlarged but stable when compared to prior examination. A right-sided IJ central venous catheter tip is seen at the cavoatrial junction.
