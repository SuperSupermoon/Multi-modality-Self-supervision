There are bibasilar opacities, which may reflect a combination of effusions and atelectasis, though pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. Upper lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. No overt interstitial edema is identified. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited due to basilar opacities.
