As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter which terminates in the mid SVC. There is no definite pneumothorax. Lung volumes have decreased accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. There has been interval obliteration of the left hemidiaphragm which may be related to a combination of low lung volumes and to atelectatic changes at the left lung base. No new focal consolidations are identified.
