In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube, with its tip approximately 7 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube tip appears to extend only to the esophagogastric junction. However, a subsequent image dictated previously shows the tip well into the stomach. The patient has taken a much better inspiration. There is again the stomach at the upper limits of normal in size without vascular congestion. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and probable small pleural effusion.
