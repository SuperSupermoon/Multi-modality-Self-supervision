Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. Dense mid to lower lung consolidation is noted with a pattern suggestive of pulmonary edema. The possibility of superimposed pneumonia not excluded. No large effusion, though the left CP angles are excluded. The heart appears top normal in size though may be magnified given AP portable technique. The mediastinal contour appears normal. No pneumothorax is seen. Bony structures are intact.
