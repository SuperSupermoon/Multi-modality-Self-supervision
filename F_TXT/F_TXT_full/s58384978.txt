Again seen are bilateral small gauge chest tubes. The chest tube on the left appears in good location. The chest tube on the right is very peripheral with the tip projecting over the right lateral ribs. This is likely in the chest wall and not in the pleural space.. There are small bilateral pleural effusions that have increased compared to the prior exam. There is volume loss at both bases. There is new infiltrate in both lower lobes as well. There is a possible right lateral pneumothorax.
