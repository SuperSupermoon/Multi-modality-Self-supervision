Underlying trauma board and other external artifact partially obscure the view. Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.9 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, the inferior aspect not included on the image. There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by low lung volumes and AP supine technique, although this will be further evaluated on pending CT torso. Possible patchy left base opacity versus related to overlying external artifact. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No displaced fracture identified.
