1. The right pleural pigtail catheter and left-sided pacer remain in place. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There continues to be a left pleural effusion with associated airspace opacity which may reflect compressive atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia also should be considered. There has been interval appearance of a more streaky linear opacity at the right base, favoring subsegmental atelectasis, although again aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. No pneumothorax is appreciated. There has been interval appearance of minimal peribronchial cuffing which may represent mild interstitial edema. Clinical correlation is advised. Contrast remains seen within the visualized colon.
