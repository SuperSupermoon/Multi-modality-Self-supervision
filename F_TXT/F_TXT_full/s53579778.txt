1. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip likely within the proximal duodenum. The distal end of a right subclavian PICC line is seen in the distal SVC, unchanged. Lung volumes are low with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. There is likely patchy opacity at both bases most consistent with bibasilar atelectasis. Clinical correlation, however, is advised.
