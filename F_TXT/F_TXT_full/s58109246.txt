Interval improvement in extent of pulmonary edema with residual edema asymmetrically worse on the right than the left. Post-operative appearance of cardiomediastinal contours is stable. Chest tube overlies left hemithorax with apparent very small left apical pneumothorax present. Improving left retrocardiac atelectasis and persistent small left pleural effusion. Band-like focus of atelectasis in left mid lung is unchanged. Layering moderate right pleural effusion is also similar to the recent study. In the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, incompletely imaged distended loops of bowel are present, and could potentially be due to post-operative ileus, but dedicated abdominal radiographs may be helpful for more complete assessment if warranted clinically.
