AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding five portable chest examinations from ___ through ___. There is further regression of the previously described bilateral extensive pulmonary parenchymal densities. Specifically, very advanced density in the right upper lobe area has undergone marked regression. Widespread poorly delineated patchy infiltrates, however, remain. Noticeable is that the lateral pleural sinuses are free and that there is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. Previously described right internal jugular approach wide-bore hemodialysis line remains in unchanged position. Heart size remains normal. There is no evidence of typical pulmonary vascular congestion.
