Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. Lung volumes have improved. Previous atelectasis in the right midlung has resolved. The decrease in left perihilar and basal opacification could be due to the larger lung volumes, but I suspect it is clearing and since heart size is also smaller it was probably due to pulmonary edema. No appreciable pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. ET tube in standard placement. Left subclavian line ends in the low SVC.
