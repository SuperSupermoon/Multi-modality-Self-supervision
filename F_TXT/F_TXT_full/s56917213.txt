The patient is rotated somewhat to the left. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Right apical opacity is nonspecific, could be due to pleural thickening/scarring however, no priors for comparison to assess chronicity. No definite pneumonia is seen. Cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified.
