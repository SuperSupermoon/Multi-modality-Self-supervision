Interval extubation. Apparent interval increase in cardiac size and width of vascular pedicle, even when allowances are made for lower lung volumes. In the setting of new widespread bilateral air space opacities, this is likely due to worsening volume status of the patient with associated widespread pulmonary edema. Coexisting aspiration is possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Bilateral pleural effusions are present, with adjacent atelectasis at the lung bases. Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, diffusely distended loops of bowel are not fully evaluated on this chest radiograph exam.
