An ET tube is present, tip approximately 6.3 cm above the carina, at the level of the upper clavicular heads. Right IJ central line tip lies in the region of the SVC/RA junction. An NG type tube is likely present, not well visualized. It most likely extends beneath the diaphragm to overlie the proximal stomach, but a be more completely and better visualized on films obtained with the increased penetration. There are low inspiratory volumes. There is dense opacification of the mid and lower zones of left lung, with obscuration of the cardiac silhouette and hemidiaphragm. This has clearly increased compared with ___ and ___. Aside from minimal atelectasis in the right upper zone and possible minimal upper zone redistribution, the right lung is grossly clear, without focal consolidation or effusion. Based on the appearance of the right heart border, the cardiomediastinal silhouette likely remains midline.
