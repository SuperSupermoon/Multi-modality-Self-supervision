1. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable status post recent median sternotomy. There is persistent consolidation at the left lung base, likely with an associated pleural effusion which most likely represents partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded.

Followup imaging to ensure resolution of this finding would be recommended as this is a new finding. No pulmonary edema.
