There is complete opacification of the right lower lung with air bronchograms suggestive of pneumonia. The large cavity in the upper lung field is partially opacified by adjacent effusion, which appears intervally increased. Increased interstitial thickening in the left lung is unchanged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax in the left.
