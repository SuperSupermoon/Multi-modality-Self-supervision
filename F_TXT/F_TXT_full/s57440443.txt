AP portable upright view of the chest. There is intubation with the endotracheal tube tip residing approximately 6.5 cm above the carina. The orogastric tube extends into the upper abdomen though the tip is not within the imaged field. A single surgical clip resides in the left upper quadrant. The lungs appear clear. Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes are noted which likely reflect chronic granulomatous disease. No large effusion or pneumothorax. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
