An endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet. There is a nasogastric tube but it terminates at the level of the mid mediastinum. Since its proximal course does not correspond to the trachea, however, it is probably in the esophagus rather than in the airway. There is tortuosity of the aorta which is mild. Patchy left infrahilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis. There may be a very small lung nodule at the right lung apex perhaps measuring 6 mm. The lungs appear otherwise clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
