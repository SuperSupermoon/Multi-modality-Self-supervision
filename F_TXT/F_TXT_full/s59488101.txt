Portable supine frontal view of the chest. An NG type tube terminates over the stomach with its side port past the GE junction. The endotracheal tube ends approximately 4 cm above the carina. The lung volumes are low; however, no chf, focal opacity, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is detected. Retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis. The heart size appears enlarged; however, this is likely due to the technique. Rounded right paratracheal density could represent a proominent azygous vein or possibly a lymph node. There is no free air in the abdomen.
