Right internal jugular vascular sheath has been removed, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, and accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion. New left retrocardiac opacity and increasing patchy and linear opacity in the right lower lobe may be due to atelectasis, but differential diagnosis includes aspiration and developing infectious pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion has increased in size.
