Pacer pad overlies to right upper outer chest. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural although there is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle and a trace effusion would be difficult to exclude. There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Slight deformities of the posterior right sixth and seventh ribs may be due to prior rib fractures.
