On the rotated image, the tip of the right subclavian catheter is in the lower portion of the SVC. Right lung is essentially clear. On the left, there is basilar opacification consistent with substantial volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. The remainder of the left lung is difficult to evaluate due to obliquity of the patient. If clinically necessary, a less obliqued view could be obtained. Tracheostomy tube remains in place. Left IJ catheter has been removed.
