In comparison with the study of ___, there continued very low lung volumes. The monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. Bibasilar opacification with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with pleural effusions and compressive basilar atelectasis. Pulmonary vascular status is difficult to assess, due to extensive scatter radiation related to the size of the patient.
