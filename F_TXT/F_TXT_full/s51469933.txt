Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is again seen cardiomegaly, which is stable. Median sternotomy wires and numerous surgical clips are seen. Calcifications of the thoracic aorta are present. There is again seen some increased density in the left retrocardiac area, which may be due to combination of scarring, atelectasis and pleural fluid. Atelectasis at the right base is more prominent than on the prior study. There are no pneumothoraces. Degenerative changes of both shoulders and rotator cuff ruptures are seen bilaterally.
