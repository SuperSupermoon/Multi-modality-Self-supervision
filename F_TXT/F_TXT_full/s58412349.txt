Heart size is normal, and diffuse tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is unchanged allowing for patient rotation. Patchy and linear bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, but aspiration and infectious pneumonia are additional considerations. Note is also made of biapical scarring and a questionable nodular opacity at the right lung apex, for which further evaluation with apical lordotic chest radiograph is recommended when the patient's condition permits.
