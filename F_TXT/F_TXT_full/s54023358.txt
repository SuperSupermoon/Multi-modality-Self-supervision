Previously seen enteric tube has been removed in the interval. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged with known pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly. There may be slight improvement in aeration of the left upper lobe. Large area of opacity in left mid to lower lung consistent with pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis along with enlarged cardiac silhouette appears minimally improved as compared to the prior study. The right lung is clear. Mild vascular congestion persists but appears improved.
