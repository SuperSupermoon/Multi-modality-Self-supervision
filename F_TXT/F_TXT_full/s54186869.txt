A left-sided chest tube is in unchanged position. There is minimal left basal atelectasis. The left hemithorax is otherwise clear. There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Again, the right hemidiaphragm is elevated, with unchanged right basilar opacification, presumably atelectasis. There is likely a small right pleural effusion, which is also unchanged. There is no right pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. A surgical drain and surgical clips in the right upper abdomen are unchanged.
