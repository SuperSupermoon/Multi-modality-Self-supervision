Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Widespread heterogeneous combined alveolar and interstitial opacities are again demonstrated, with interval worsening in the left upper lobe. Observed findings may reflect diffuse infection or edema superimposed upon known chronic interstitial lung disease, or could reflect acute exacerbation of ILD. Bilateral pleural effusions are again demonstrated as well as a hiatal hernia.
