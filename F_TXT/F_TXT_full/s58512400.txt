Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is again seen a right IJ central line with distal lead tip in the right atrium. This could be pulled back 4 cm for more optimal placement. The heart size is within normal limits. There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally and prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings which are stable. There are no pneumothoraces. The endotracheal tube and the enteric tube are unchanged in position.
