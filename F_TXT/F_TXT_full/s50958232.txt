In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum following unsuccessful Dobhoff placement. Continued opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the lower lobe. The right hemidiaphragm is quite sharp on the current study. Tip of the left subclavian PICC line again extends to the region of the cavoatrial junction.
