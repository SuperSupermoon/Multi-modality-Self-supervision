Since the prior study, there has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which terminates 4 cm above the carina being in appropriate position. Additionally, a nasogastric tube is in place, coursing into the stomach and terminating beyond the field of view. Bibasilar streaky opacities and right upper lobe nodular opacities are unchanged compared to the prior study, compatible with aspiration or infection. Left mastectomy and partially visualized left axillary lymph node dissection changes are again seen.
