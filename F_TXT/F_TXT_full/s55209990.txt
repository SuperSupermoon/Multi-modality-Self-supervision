A right internal jugular venous catheter terminates in the superior vena cava. The heart is moderately enlarged. There is new moderate pulmonary edema. Lung opacification is particularly confluent along the left mid lung. For the latter, since it is more focal than more generalized opacification, the possibility of an additional process such as aspiration could also be considered in the appropriate setting. There may be a trace pleural effusion on the right, none clearly present on the left. The stomach is distended.
