As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is now extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The lung volumes remain relatively low. Areas of atelectasis are seen at the left lung bases and there is minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting a mild left pleural effusion. No pulmonary edema. No pneumonia.
