In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is a small residual right apical pneumothorax. Basilar opacifications are again seen, especially on the right. In view of the clinical history, this could represent pulmonary contusion or aspiration. The right chest tube remains in place. The striking dilatation of the gas filled stomach seen on the previous study is not appreciated at this time.
