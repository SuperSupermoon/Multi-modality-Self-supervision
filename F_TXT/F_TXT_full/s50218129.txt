Single frontal image of the chest demonstrates improved bilateral pulmonary opacities since prior imaging. The slightly less transparent lungs on this exam are likely secondary to the AP portable technique used on this exam when compared to the previous imaging PA views. The pulmonary vessels appear slightly improved since prior imaging. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
