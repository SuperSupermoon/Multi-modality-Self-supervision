Tip of the right PICC is in a similar position, in the right brachiocephalic vein. Lung volumes are extremely low, with bibasilar consolidations. Small left pleural effusion is presumed. No pneumothorax. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. The crescentic lucency under the right hemidiaphragm is re- demonstrated, and remains concerning for subdiaphragmatic free air. However, note that due to difficulty with patient positioning, a true upright radiograph could not be obtained.
