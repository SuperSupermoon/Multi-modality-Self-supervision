AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The left internal jugular line tip is at the left brachiocephalic vein before the junction with superior vena cava. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Bibasilar consolidations are noted, right more than left. There is also suspicion for at least partial left upper lobe consolidation, potentially reflecting atelectasis.
