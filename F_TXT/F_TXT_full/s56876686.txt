Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours. Rounded opacity projecting over the right upper lung adjacent to anterolateral fourth rib deformity may reflect sequaelae of trauma. Known acute left lower limb fracture is not well appreciated on current study. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
