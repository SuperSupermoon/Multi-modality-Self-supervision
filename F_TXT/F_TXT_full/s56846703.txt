Multifocal opacities primarily in the right upper lobe and left upper lobe as well as in the lower lobes are more conspicuous on the prior than on the prior study with some more peripheral location. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. ET tube tip is 4.4 cm above the carinal. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Left internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Overall the findings are consistent with multifocal pneumonia although non infectious pneumonia such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or eosinophilic pneumonia also to be considered. Small pleural effusion is most likely present. Correlation with chest CT is to be considered.
