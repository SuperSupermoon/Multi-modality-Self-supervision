As compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, multifocal opacities in the right lung show slight interval improvement in the right lower lobe. Left basilar opacities have slightly worsened. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged, and a small right pleural effusion has apparently decreased in size. No other relevant changes.
