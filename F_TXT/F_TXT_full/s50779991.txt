AP chest compared to ___ at 2:57 p.m.: Small left apical pneumothorax is slightly larger, increasing from the level of the third posterior interspace to the bottom of the fourth posterior rib, although some of the change could be due to difference in level of inspiration. Moderate right pleural effusion is stable. There may also have been an increase in volume of left pleural effusion which is difficult to assess because of a substantial increase in left basal atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly is more severe and mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
