A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid superior vena cava, as seen previously. No pneumothorax is seen. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is detected on this view; the right costophrenic angle is slightly incompletely imaged. Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits and stable.
