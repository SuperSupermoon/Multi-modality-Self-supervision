Endotracheal tube and central venous catheter are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for positional differences. Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion and improving left mid and lower lung opacities, likely due to a combination of consolidation and atelectasis in this patient with recurrent collapse of the left lung on previous serial radiographs. Moderate left and small right pleural effusions appear similar. Poorly defined opacity in the right upper lobe has slightly improved. Otherwise, no relevant short-interval change.
