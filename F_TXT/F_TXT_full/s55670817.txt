AP chest compared to ___: The progressive diffuse basal predominant pulmonary abnormality which developed between ___, is almost certainly pulmonary edema and other findings of congestive heart failure. Today, there is considerably more heterogeneous opacity in the right upper and mid lung zones, raising possibility of concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage, although both basal consolidation and small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions have increased, which are signs of worsening cardiac decompensation. Left internal jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
