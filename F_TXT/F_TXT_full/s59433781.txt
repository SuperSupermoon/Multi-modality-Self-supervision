Extreme lower right chest wall costophrenic angle excluded from the film. An ET tube is present, the tip lies approximately 5.0 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Clips and other radiopacities are noted in the region of the GE junction. A left PICC or other line overlies the SVC/ upper right atrium. A new dual-lumen central line catheter overlies the distal SVC and upper right atrium. The previously seen right PleurX catheter has been removed. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged, accentuated by rotated positioning . Again seen are small to moderate left and small right pleural effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, also similar to the prior study.
