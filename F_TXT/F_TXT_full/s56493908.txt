AP chest compared to ___: Large left pleural effusion, small right pleural effusion, both unchanged. Heart size is normal, but mediastinal veins are probably enlarged. Large lung masses are partially obscured by widespread abnormality in the left lung, probably edema. Given the extensive metastatic pulmonary involvement and concurrent pleural normality, I strongly urge chest CT scanning to compare with studies done as recently as late ___. ET tube is in standard placement, right central venous infusion port ends in the upper right atrium, and an upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. There is no pneumothorax.
