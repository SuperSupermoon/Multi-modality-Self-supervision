Comparison is made with prior studies performed a day earlier including CT and x-ray. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is new. Moderate cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacities larger on the left side are unchanged. Enlarged pulmonary artery, mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy are better seen in prior CT.
