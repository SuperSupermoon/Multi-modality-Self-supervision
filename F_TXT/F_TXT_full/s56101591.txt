The lungs are moderately well inflated with persistent pulmonary edema. There is interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions. Left retrocardiac opacity silhouetting the left hemidiaphragm likely represent atelectasis. The pulmonary artery catheter is again visualized and terminates slightly distally within the right pulmonary artery compared to the prior radiograph. However this appearance may be related to the technique. Dual lead AICD projects over the left upper thorax with intact pacer wires. Right sided central line terminates in the SVC. Numerous EKG leads overlie the chest wall. Sternotomy sutures and a mechanical cardiac valve remain unchanged.
