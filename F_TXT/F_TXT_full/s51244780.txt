Tip of intra-aortic balloon pump terminates 4.5 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. Other indwelling devices are in standard and unchanged position, except for removal of midline drains. Bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are slightly decreased in width compared to the prior study, likely due to improving volume status of the patient. There remains pulmonary vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema, however. Bibasilar retrocardiac atelectasis is again demonstrated, slightly improved on the left.
