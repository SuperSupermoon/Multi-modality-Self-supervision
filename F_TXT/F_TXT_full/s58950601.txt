Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of left-sided PICC, which terminates in the low SVC. Previously seen right-sided PICC which is curled in the right axilla is no longer seen. There is also interval removal of previously seen right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter. The patient is status post median sternotomy. The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable, with the aorta tortuous and unfolded. There appears to have been slight interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions which may in part relate to differences in patient position. There are increased perihilar opacities suggesting pulmonary edema. Left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis; however, underlying consolidation is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen.
