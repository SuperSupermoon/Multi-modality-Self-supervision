There is complete white-out of the left hemithorax consistent with a large pleural effusion and large atelectasis of the left lung. Cardiomediastinum is mildly shifted towards the right. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated. ET tube is low. The tip is 12 mm from the carina, should be withdrawn 1-2 cm for a more standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. In the right lung, there are minimal atelectasis in the base. Right PICC tip is in the lower SVC.
