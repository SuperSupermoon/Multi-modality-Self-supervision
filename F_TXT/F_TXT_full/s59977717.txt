The heart is mildly enlarged. The aortic arch is calcified. The descending aorta also shows patchy calcification. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Streaky right basilar opacities are associated with a moderate persistent relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, not significantly changed and suggesting minor associated atelectasis. Streaky left basilar opacification obscuring the left costophrenic sulcus also suggests minor atelectasis, likewise unchanged. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
