A right pigtail catheter projects over the upper hemithorax and no pneumothorax is seen. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. A left subclavian PICC line is likely unchanged in position. There has been interval near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax which likely represents a combination of collapsed lung, possibly related to mucus plugging, and layering left pleural effusion. Patchy opacity in the right upper lung may represent an area of aspiration or pneumonia and is not significantly changed. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Spinal hardware is seen overlying the visualized cervical and upper thoracic spine.
