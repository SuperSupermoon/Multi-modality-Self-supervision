Lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the heart and mediastinal contours, with the heart size appearing mildly enlarged. The aorta is unfolded. No hilar enlargement is seen, and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Hazy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
