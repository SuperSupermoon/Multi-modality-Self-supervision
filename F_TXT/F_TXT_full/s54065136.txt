There is a low inspiratory lung volumes. Allowing for changes due to this, the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged, with a top normal cardiac silhouette size. The bilateral hila are grossly unremarkable. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. Minimal streaky opacity at the right lung base likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. Additionally,diffuse, subtle mild interstitial prominence likely relates to a combination of age-related changes and crowding of bronchovascular structures in the setting of a limited inspiratory effort. No focal lung consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax detected. Roughly circular calcifications of varying sizes overlying the left upper abdomen and a left lower lung are of uncertain etiology, but may relate to calcified cartilaginous rib ends.
