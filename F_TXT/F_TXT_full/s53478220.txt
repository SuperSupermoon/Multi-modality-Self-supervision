There is persistent moderate but slightly smaller left effusion with no evidence of pneumothorax status post thoracentesis. Stable small right pleural effusion. There is slight improved aeration in the retrocardiac region likely secondary to decreasing atelectasis in the left lower lobe lobe. Scattered nodular opacities in both lungs concerning for metastatic static disease are better appreciated on the CT dated ___. Increasing interstitial abnormality suggests interval appearance of superimposed edema. Patchy opacity at the right base has improved suggestive of resolving atelectasis. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given differences in patient rotation.
