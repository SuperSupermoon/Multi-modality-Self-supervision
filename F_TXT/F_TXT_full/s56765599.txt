Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. No pneumothorax is seen. Extensive bilateral interstitial abnormality, largel pulmonary fibrosis, has worsened over six months, which can be due either to worsening of the fibrosis or concurrent pulmonary edema. The hila and mediastinal vasculature and the moderate cardiomegaly are more pronounced, which can be explained either by biventricular or progressive right heart failure. No pleural effusion.
