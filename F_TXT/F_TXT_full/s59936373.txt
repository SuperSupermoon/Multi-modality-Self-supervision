There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, seen terminating 7.4 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is also seen in place, extending into the stomach and out of the view of this radiograph. Redemonstrated is a small left pleural effusion with minimal atelectatic changes noted within the left lower and right middle lobes. The remainder of the lungs are grossly unremarkable. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
