Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Underlying trauma board partially obscures the view. The left lateral lower hemithorax is not fully included on the image. Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No displaced fracture is identified.
