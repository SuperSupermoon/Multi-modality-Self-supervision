Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter which terminates in the mid SVC. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Slight prominence of the hila may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement. Perihilar opacities, improved since the prior study, perhaps in part due to deeper inspiration. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
