Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.1 cm above the level of the carina, in appropriate position. A right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter is seen, which appears slightly high in position, terminating in the region of the right innominate vein/right internal jugular/innominate vein junction. There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. The superior mediastinum appears widened, which may be accentuated by AP technique, supine position; if there is clinical concern for acute aortic process, suggest chest CTA. Mild bibasilar atelectasis seen. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal.
