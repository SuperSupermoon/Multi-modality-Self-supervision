Markedly asymmetric interstitial pulmonary abnormality involving most of the left lung been relatively small regions at the right base and in the axillary region of the right upper lobe, has developed since ___. It is hard to say whether heart size has increased, since cardiac apex is obscured by the left hemidiaphragm and the spleen. Pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature do not look particularly engorged and pleural effusion if present is small. Pulmonary edema could be the cause of this finding but the cause of the asymmetry needs to be explained, usually due to decubitus positioning or severe preexisting lung disease. The last time the patient was in pulmonary edema, ___, the there was only mildly greater edema in the left lung than the right, so this is not a pattern dictated by pulmonary circulatory differences. It could instead be due to pneumonia, particularly caused by virus or, given the appropriate predisposition, pneumocystis. It could be pulmonary hemorrhage, or pulmonary drug reaction, such as due to acute amiodarone administration.
