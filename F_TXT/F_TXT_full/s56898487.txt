Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The left subclavian line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Heart size and mediastinal appear to be unchanged, but there is interval improvement of left upper lobe atelectasis as well as mid left lung atelectasis with more central position of the mediastinum but with still present minimal left basal atelectasis. Surgical clips are projecting over the recently placed internal fixator of the right humerus. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen. No interval development of substantial pleural effusion is demonstrated.
