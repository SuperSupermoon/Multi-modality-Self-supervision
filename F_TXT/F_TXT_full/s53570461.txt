Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. A tracheostomy tube appears to be in place, although it is difficult to determine the location of the tip due to the projection of imaging. This will likely be better assessed on followup imaging. Multiple surgical clips are seen overlying the right upper chest and right hilum. No pneumothorax is seen. No pulmonary edema. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. There may be small layering effusions. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning between studies.
