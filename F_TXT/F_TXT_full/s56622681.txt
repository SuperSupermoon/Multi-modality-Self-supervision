Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.7 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube tip is within the stomach, however the side port lies within the distal esophagus, and the tube should be advanced for optimal positioning. Low lung volumes are present. The heart size is top normal. Mediastinal contours appear unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. No displaced fractures are visualized.
