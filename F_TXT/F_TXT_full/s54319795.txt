An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm overlying stomach. There is hazy opacity at the right base, which could reflect a small layering effusion, with underlying atelectasis and/or consolidation. There is a very small left effusion, also with left base atelectasis and/or consolidation. No pneumothorax detected. No CHF. Residual oral contrast noted in the hepatic flexure. 2 clips noted over the upper abdomen in the midline. No free air seen beneath the diaphragm on this semi-erect portable view. There is subtle focal irregularity along a lower right rib laterally, question the right eighth rib, raising question of a nondisplaced rib fracture.
