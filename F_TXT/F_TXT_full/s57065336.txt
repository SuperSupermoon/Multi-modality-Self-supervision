Lung volumes have diminished with patchy opacities at both bases suggestive of atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is likely a layering left effusion. No evidence of pulmonary edema. There is crowding of the vasculature given the low lung volumes. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the diminished lung volumes and patient rotation. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
