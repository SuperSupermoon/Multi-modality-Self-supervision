In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased hazy opacification at both bases with obscuration hemidiaphragms, consistent with increasing layering effusions and compressive volume loss in the lower lungs. This makes it somewhat difficult to assess the pulmonary vascularity, though there does not appear to be substantial vascular congestion. The new nasogastric tube is been pulled back somewhat, so that the side port is just distal to the EG junction. Endotracheal tube remains in good position.
