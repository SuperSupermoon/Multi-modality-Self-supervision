Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There has been some interval improvement in the bilateral airspace process suggesting improving moderate pulmonary edema. No large effusions are seen. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Several rounded opacities overlying the stomach and in the right upper quadrant may reflect ingested pills.
