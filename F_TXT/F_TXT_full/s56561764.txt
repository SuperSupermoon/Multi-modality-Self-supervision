Comparison is made with the prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. Moderate cardiomegaly, widened mediastinum are stable. Lines and tubes are in standard positions. There is no pneumothorax. Large left pleural effusion and adjacent perihilar and left lower lobe opacities are grossly unchanged. Right lower lobe opacity has increased consistent with increasing atelectasis and small-to-moderate effusion. Mild vascular congestion is minimally improved.
