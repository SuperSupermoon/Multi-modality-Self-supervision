The lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including prominence of central mediastinal pulmonary arteries. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is again striking upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vasculature suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension although not significantly changed. Otherwise, aside from slight suspected atelectasis at the left lung base, the lungs appear clear.
