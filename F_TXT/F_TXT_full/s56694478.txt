Evaluation is limited due to patient's rotation and low lung volumes. The heart size is difficult to assess given the degree of rotation but may be mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. Assessment of the mediastinal and hilar contours is limited. There are low lung volumes with crowding of the bronchovascular structures and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky bibasilar airspace opacities are present. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Widened right AC joint is chronic, unchanged from ___.
