Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained at 8:22 p.m. The left internal jugular line has been retracted currently with its tip crossing the midline, terminating at the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC. There is still abnormal position of the NG tube noted. Rest of the findings are unchanged.
