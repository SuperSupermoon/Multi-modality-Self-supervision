There is extensive pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema within the right neck and right lateral chest. There is no definite pneumothorax on this supine view even though there was one demonstrated on the previous CT is. There is widening of the superior mediastinum likely reflective of mediastinal hematoma. Additionally, extrapleural opacity overlying of the left lung apex is compatible with extrapleural soft tissue hematoma. Opacity involving the right upper lobe could reflect contusion. There are multiple right-sided rib fractures and left first rib fracture, better demonstrated on the previous CT count. Angulation of the left midclavicle likely relates to prior injury.
