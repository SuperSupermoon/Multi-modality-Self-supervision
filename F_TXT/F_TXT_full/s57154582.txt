As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously malpositioned Dobbhoff catheter (a coiled catheter was seen in the right main bronchus) has been re-positioned. The course of the catheter is now unremarkable, the tip is not included on the image. No evidence of complications. No changes in appearance of the heart and of the lung parenchyma.
