As compared to the previous radiograph, the course of the nasogastric tube that has been newly inserted is unremarkable, the tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach. The position of the endotracheal tube is constant. The pre-existing rather diffuse parenchymal opacities are now more concentrated around the perihilar regions. No opacities have newly occurred. No pneumothorax. No larger effusions. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant.
