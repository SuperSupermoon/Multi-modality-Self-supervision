There is a large left-sided pleural effusion with slight rightward shift of mediastinal structures, similar to the prior study allowing for differences in technique including positioning. There is probable associated extensive atelectasis of the left lung. Patchy right basilar opacity has a flat linear morphology suggestive of atelectasis, which is also similar. There is no pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion on the right.
