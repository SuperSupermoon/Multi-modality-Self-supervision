In comparison to the prior chest x-ray performed earlier on the same date, there is apparent worsening of the left lung base opacity, which is at least partially due to a small pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. However, given recent progression over the past several hours, aspiration should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. No other relevant changes. The endotracheal tube, left subclavian line and enteric tube are unchanged in position.
