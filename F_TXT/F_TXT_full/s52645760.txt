Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in standard position. Heart size is normal. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by minimal interstitial edema. Slight blunting of left costophrenic sulcus is suggestive of a small pleural effusion. Asymmetrical opacity at right lung apex is probably due to summation of normal structures given the extreme apical lordotic projection, but attention to this region on short-term followup radiograph with standard positioning would be helpful to exclude an acute lung abnormality in this region. Of note, there is no evidence of lung mass in the right apex on images of the upper chest performed as part of a CT neck exam of one day earlier.
