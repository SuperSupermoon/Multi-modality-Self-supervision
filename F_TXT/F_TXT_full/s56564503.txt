Since the prior radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates low in the distal trachea. A thoracic aortic stent is in place with no evidence of kinks or discontinuities. New retrocardiac airspace opacity is most likely due to atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax but minimal post-procedural pneumomediastinum. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is new moderate subcutaneous emphysema in the bilateral supraclavicular regions and left chest wall.
