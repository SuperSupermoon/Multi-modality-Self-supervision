An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, approximately 3.8 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses in the left mid hemithorax. This may due to deviation of the esophagus, though could be in the left main stem bronchus and into a posterior left lower lobe bronchi. There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax in this patient status post left pneumonectomy. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is deviated leftward. A component of consolidation or fluid is difficult to exclude. The right lung is clear without a consolidation or pulmonary edema. There is no right pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no definite left pneumothorax. Old rib deformities are noted on the left which may relate to a prior procedure. They appear well corticated. No definite acute fractures identified.
