As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. As a consequence, the multifocal parenchymal opacities, predominating in the right upper lobe and in the left mid lung zones, have decreased in severity. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Unchanged extent of a small to moderate left pleural effusion and the subsequent left retrocardiac atelectasis. No new focal parenchymal opacities. All monitoring and support devices continue to be in correct position.
