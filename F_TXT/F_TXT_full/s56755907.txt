ETT tip is approximately 3 cm from the carina. The film has the appearance of a more apical lordotic technique. The contours of the left hemidiaphragm are not clearly defined and there is a retrocardiac opacity. These could reflect atelectasis although infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax. The heart is mildly enlarged. Aortic knob is calcified. Patient is status post median sternotomy and several of the sternotomy wires are fractured. A partially visualized enteric tube traverses the hemidiaphragm into the left upper quadrant but its tip is beyond the scope of this imaging. Several radio-opaque surgical material projects just to the left of the thoracic spine in the mediastinum.
