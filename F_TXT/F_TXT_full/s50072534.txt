A left mid lung opacity is once again reflective of known radiation fibrosis. Right hemithorax volume is unchanged. The right lower lung opacification reflects a known right lower lung lesion better evaluated on prior PET-CT. There is biapical thickening which is stable. The cardiomediastinal hilar contours are stable. The osseous structures are diffusely sclerotic consistent with a known history of osteoblastic metastasis best seen on prior imaging.
