Right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the mid SVC. Heart size remains top normal. Mediastinal contour is unchanged with prominence of the pulmonary arteries suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension, better assessed on the recent CT. Left basilar opacification likely reflecting combination of the patient's known necrotic left lower lobe mass and small left pleural effusion is relatively similar compared to the previous radiograph. No new focal consolidation is present. There is no pneumothorax. Multiple clips are demonstrated within the medial aspect of the imaged left upper extremity.
