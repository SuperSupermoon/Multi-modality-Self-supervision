A Dobbhoff catheter terminates just distal to the gastroesophageal junction. The catheter could be safely advanced 5-10 cm to be well positioned within the gastric body. Lung volumes are extremely low. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures and bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right. Heart size is difficult to assess. No pneumothorax.
