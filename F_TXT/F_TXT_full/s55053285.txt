Comparison is made with prior studies performed earlier the same day. There has been interval decrease in size in a very small left pleural effusion. There is no evident pneumothorax. There is a new left basal chest tube. A right basal chest tube remains in place. Left lower lobe atelectasis has markedly improved. Mild vascular congestion is stable. There are no other changes.
