Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. A right base pleural catheter is noted, there appears to have been advance when compared to prior study. Right lower lobe collapse is persistent. The amount of right pleural effusion is difficult to evaluate, probably unchanged. Left lower lobe atelectasis has increased. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Right PICC tip is the lower SVC.
