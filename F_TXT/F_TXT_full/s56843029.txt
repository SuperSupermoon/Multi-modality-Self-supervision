As compared to the previous examination, the tip of the PICC line now appears to project over the upper SVC, at the level of the confluence with the brachiocephalic vein. However, the tip is difficult to visualize given overlay with a newly introduced right central venous access line. The course of this line is unremarkable and the tip of this line projects over the inflow tract of the right atrium. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
