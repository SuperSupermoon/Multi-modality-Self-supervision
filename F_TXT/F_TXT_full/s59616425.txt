AP chest compared to ___: Left upper lobe collapse on ___ cleared, but there is still substantial opacification in both lower lungs, most likely severe atelectasis, but conceivably consolidation. The distribution does not favor pulmonary edema. Mild cardiomegaly is stable, but there is no vascular engorgement to suggest cardiac decompensation. Left subclavian line ends at the origin of the SVC. ET tube in standard placement. Upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
