The endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the right atrium. There is slight improvement in lung volumes, but there is persistent bibasilar consolidation suggestive of lower lobe atelectasis when correlated with CT of ___. A superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. There is also likely a left layering pleural effusion. There is fullness to both hilar regions, which may represent prominent vasculature as lymphadenopathy would be less likely given the absence of significant lymphadenopathy on the recent chest CT of ___. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
