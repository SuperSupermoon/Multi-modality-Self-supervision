A single portable supine frontal chest radiograph was obtained. There has been slight interval improvement in the degree of opacification of a right upper lobe pulmonary contusion. Several smaller bilateral contusions are also noted. There is no new consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube remains in the upper airway. An enteric catheter loops in the stomach and extends below the field of view. Two right and two left chest tubes are unchanged. Mediastinal drain and median sternotomy wires are stable. Extensive vascular surgical clips are seen overlying the right upper chest.
