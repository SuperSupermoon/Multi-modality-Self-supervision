Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. Surgical clips again noted in the neck. Left CP angle is excluded. Central pulmonary hilar engorgement is changed from prior, which could represent increased pulmonary arterial pressures. Left lung base is poorly assessed with subtle increased opacity which could represent a developing pneumonia. Right lung remains clear. Heart and mediastinal contour is stable. Atherosclerotic calcification in the aortic knob noted. Bony structures intact.
