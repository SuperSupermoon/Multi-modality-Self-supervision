The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the clavicles. An enteric tube enters the stomach, tip not visualized. A rounded opacity at the right lung apex corresponds to extensive scarring and bronchiectasis, which was partially imaged on the recent C-spine CT. Left apical scarring with retraction of the hilum and of volume loss is unchanged. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits. Overlying tubing contributes to increased opacification at the left base.
