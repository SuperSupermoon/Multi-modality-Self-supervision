Cardiomegaly is moderate, unchanged. There is interval development of left lower lobe consolidation that might represent infectious process or combination of infection atelectasis. Aspiration is another possibility. No pneumothorax is seen. Pulmonary nodules are potentially present in the right lower lobe. Sclerotic foci noted in the left shoulder which appears to have substantial degenerative disease. Correlation with chest CT is to be considered if clinically warranted.
