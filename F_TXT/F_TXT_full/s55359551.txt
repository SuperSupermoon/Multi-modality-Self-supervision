1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid-to-distal SVC, unchanged. Nasogastric tube is seen with the tip just below the gastroesophageal junction and the side port within the distal esophagus. Advancement is advised at this time. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. A right chest tube remains in place. There is improved aeration of both lung bases with residual patchy opacities which may reflect residual atelectasis, although acute pneumonia cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Right-sided rib fractures now have plates with multiple screws traversing the fractures. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax has diminished given supine positioning. The recommendation for advancing the nasogastric tube was conveyed to the patient's house staff, Dr. ___, by phone on ___ at 5:04 p.m.
