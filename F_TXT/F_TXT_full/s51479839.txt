Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities worse in the left midlung are extensive. A nodular opacity at the left lung base is concerning for a pulmonary nodule. There is mild cardiomegaly. A cardiac conduction device is contiguous with leads which end in the right ventricle, through the coronary sinus and probably right atrium. A right PICC ends in the mid SVC. An endotracheal tube ends in the mid thoracic trachea. The distal tip of an enteric tube is not definitively visualized but likely courses below the level of the diaphragm.
