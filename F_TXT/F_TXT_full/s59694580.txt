Lung volumes are low. Opacity in the left lower lung with indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle is probably a combination of atelectasis and a small effusion. A trace right pleural effusion is likely also present. Increased interstitial prominence and pulmonary vascular congestion is moderate, more pronounced from the prior exam and suggest some degree of edema and volume overload, even in the setting of low lung volumes. No pneumothorax. No definite focal consolidation. The heart is probably mildly enlarged. Severe S-shaped scoliosis and distortion of the thoracic cage is similar to the prior exam.
