A right PICC terminates near the cavoatrial junction. There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with leftward mediastinal shift, consistent with left lung collapse. A small component of a left pleural effusion is also likely present. There appears to be an abrupt cut-off of visualization of the left mainstem brochus. The right lung is grossly clear. Possible 4 mm nodular opacity is seen projecting over the right mid lung field. There is no pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
