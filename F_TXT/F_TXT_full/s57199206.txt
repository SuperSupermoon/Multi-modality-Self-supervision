1. Interval intubation with the tip of the endotracheal tube approximately 3 cm above the carina. There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube which is coiled within the proximal esophagus but then heads distally with the side port at the diaphragmatic level and the tip below the diaphragm. Re-positioning would be advised in order to minimize the risk of aspiartion. The patient's nurse, ___, was notified of the recommendation for re-positioning by phone on ___ at 10:24 a.m. A single-lead left-sided pacer is in place with the tip projecting over the right ventricle. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Lung volumes are markedly diminished with crowding of the vasculature but no evidence of a pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The bowel is markedly distended suggesting bowel obstruction or severe ileus. Clinical correlation is advised. Surgical skin ___ are seen in the lower mid abdomen suggesting recent surgery.
