AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. Tracheostomy is in place. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged as well as there is evidence of widespread lung fibrosis, not substantially changed since the prior study. Previously seen right lower lung consolidation appears to be slightly improved since the prior study. No other interval changes have been seen in the interim. In addition to suspected pneumonia, acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease such as acute interstitial pneumonia should be considered.
