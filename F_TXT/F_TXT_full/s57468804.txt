Comparison is made with prior study performed three hours earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal, shifted towards the left as before, due to large amount of loss of volume in the left lower lobe. Small bilateral effusions are larger on the left side, associated with adjacent atelectasis. Right apical pleural parenchymal scarring and calcified granulomas are better seen in prior CT. Right PICC is in the cavoatrial junction.
