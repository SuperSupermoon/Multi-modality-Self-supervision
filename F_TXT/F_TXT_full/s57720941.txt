Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach, and off the inferior borders of the film. Heart size appears at least mild to moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Patchy opacities in lung bases my reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, however the extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. Mild degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine. Punctate calcific densities in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen may reflect gallstones.
