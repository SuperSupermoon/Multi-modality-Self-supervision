In comparison with the study of ___, there is again a small apical pneumothorax on the right. Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and there is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Continued right pleural effusion with compressive basilar atelectasis. The change in appearance suggests a more supine position of the patient on the current study. The area of increased opacification just above the minor fissure on the previous study is no longer appreciated.
