AP chest compared to ___, ___, and 6:30 a.m. today: While I do not see any left pneumothorax, there has been interval increase in subcutaneous emphysema in the left neck and chest wall which is sometimes an indication of incipient pneumothorax. Two left pleural tubes unchanged in position, one at the base, one at the apex of the small postoperative left hemithorax. Left lung is well aerated. Right lung is entirely clear. There may be a small right pleural effusion. Leftward mediastinal shift is as expected.
