An obliquely oriented radiograph of the chest was obtained to assess for PICC placement. A substantial portion of the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax was excluded from this radiograph. It demonstrates a right PICC with tip terminating in the proximal right atrium. Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube. Stable appearance of cardiomediastinal contours. Apparent increased size of small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent basilar atelectasis adjacent to a hiatal hernia. Persistent elevation of right hemidiaphragm.
