AP chest read in conjunction with chest CT scan ___: There is no pneumothorax. Skin fold parallel to the left chest wall, should not be mistaken for pleural edge. The volume of pleural effusion is underestimated on the supine view, but unless there has been thoracentesis since the chest CT scan two hours earlier, moderate effusions remain. Atelectasis has improved. Severe cardiomegaly has not. Focal opacity in right mid lung could be fissural pleural fluid or developing pneumonia. Upright radiographs recommended when feasible. Tip of the endotracheal tube with the chin down is only at the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 9 cm from the carina and should be advanced 4 cm for more secured seating.
