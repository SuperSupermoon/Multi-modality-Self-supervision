Single portable view of the chest. There is increased parenchymal opacity in the left lung compared to the right. Subtle right basilar opacity may also be present, although may be due to overlying soft tissues. Cardiac silhouette is top normal in size for technique and positioning. Retrocardiac opacity seen medially could represent hiatal hernia, but is not well assessed. There is no large effusion. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
