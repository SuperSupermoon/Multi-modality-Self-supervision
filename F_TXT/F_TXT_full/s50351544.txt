An enteric tube is noted with tip in the distal esophagus, and should be advanced by approximately 15 cm for appropriate positioning within the stomach. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Lungs are hyperinflated with findings suggestive of emphysema. Streaky left basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are mild degenerative changes within the thoracic spine with S-shaped scoliosis.
