Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiomediastinal contours and result in bilateral bronchovascular crowding, limiting assessment of the cardiovascular status of the patient. Despite this limitation, the presence of peripheral interstitial opacities suggests the possibility of interstitial edema. Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, aspiration and less likely infectious pneumonia. Consider followup PA and lateral chest radiographs with improved inspiratory level for initial further assessment of these findings.
