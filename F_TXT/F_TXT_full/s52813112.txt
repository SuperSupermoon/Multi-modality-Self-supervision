The carina is not well visualized. However, the ET tube tip probably lies approximately 4.0 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. Right IJ central line tip overlies the upper right atrium. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for considerable technical difference. Again seen is upper zone redistribution mild vascular plethora, overall similar to the prior study. There is increased retrocardiac density with obscuration left hemidiaphragm, which may be slightly worse. Clips again noted in the region of the GE junction.
