The endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above the carina. An enteric tube descends along the thoracic midline beyond the GE junction though the tip is not included in the imaged field. The heart appears top-normal in size. There is hilar congestion without frank edema. CP angles are excluded bilaterally limiting assessment. There is subtle lower lung opacity which could represent layering fluid and or atelectasis/pneumonia.
