As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, lung volumes have increased. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is, however, a new ill-defined opacity in the right upper lung which is concerning for an early infectious process. Lungs are otherwise clear. There is no definite pneumothorax or pleural effusion. A right subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the distal SVC, unchanged in position. Tracheostomy tube is in place.
