As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Cardiomegaly with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and bilateral areas of atelectasis. Status post intubation, the tube has been advanced and the tip now projects at the level of the sternoclavicular joints. The nasogastric tube and the right internal jugular vein catheter are unchanged. Minimal increase in density around the left perihilar areas, probably vascular, the area should receive attention on future followups.
