AP chest compared to ___, 3:12 a.m.: There is no pneumothorax following removal of left pleural drain.

Small pleural effusions and moderate-to-severe atelectasis are present in both lower lungs. The upper lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette has a normal postoperative appearance. Pulmonary flotation catheter ends in the main pulmonary artery.
