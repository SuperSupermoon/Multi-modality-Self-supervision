Substantial increase in left upper lobe heterogeneous consolidation and new peripheral areas of heterogeneous opacity are very suggestive of worsening pneumonia and septic emboli or multiple pulmonary infarctions. There may be a mild component of pulmonary edema due to volume overload reflected in mild increase in both heart size and caliber of mediastinal veins. Small left and small to moderate right pleural effusion are unchanged.
