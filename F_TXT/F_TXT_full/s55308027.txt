Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study. The extent of the loculations is unchanged with slight decrease of the posterior opacity that might be consistent with increase in pleural fluid and overall unchanged appearance as compared to the pre-thoracocentesis attempt. No pneumothorax is currently seen.
