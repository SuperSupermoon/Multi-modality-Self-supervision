A new, horizontally oriented opacity, in the right perihilar region is probably atelectasis. Minimal right lung base opacity and increased retrocardiac density, pronounced over last 24 hours, is either worsening atelectasis or secondary to aspiration, however, lung infection cannot be rule out. Pleural effusion on the left side, if any, is minimal. Mild vascular engorgement is unchanged, and there is no pulmonary edema. Followup radiographs recommended to monitor the changes in lungs.
