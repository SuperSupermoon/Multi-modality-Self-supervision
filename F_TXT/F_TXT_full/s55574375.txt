As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. However, subtle areas of atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases persists. The size of the cardiac silhouette is normal. There are no larger pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. The position of the right internal jugular vein catheter is constant.
