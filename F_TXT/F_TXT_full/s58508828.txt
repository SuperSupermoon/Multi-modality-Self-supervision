Right subclavian PICC line and right internal jugular large bore venous catheter are unchanged in position. There continue be layering bilateral effusions with worsening mild to moderate interstitial and pulmonary edema. Tirangular opacity in the periphery of the right upper lobe may reflect loculated pleural fluid. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged but somewhat difficult to assess due to the worsening perihilar airspace process. No pneumothorax.
