Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ (preoperative study). The current examination demonstrates the patient being intubated with the ET tube tip being 3.4 cm above the carina. The NG tube passes along the esophagus with its tip projecting over the previously seen hernia and unclear where it is located. Surgical drains are projecting also over the left mid lower lung. Upper lungs are clear. Left basal opacity is noted, and it is impossible to assess this area for the presence of pneumothorax or for the location of the hernia after surgery. No visible pneumothorax is present.
