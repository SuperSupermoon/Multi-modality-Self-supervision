AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are appreciably lower, with a change in distribution of right basal atelectasis. Mediastinal caliber and pulmonary vascularity have increased indicating increased central venous pressure or volume, but I don't see pulmonary edema. Heart size is top normal. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
