AP chest at 23:18 compared to ___ a.m. Previously symmetric largely interstitial severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality on ___ accompanied by small bilateral pleural effusions was probably pulmonary edema. Today edema has improved somewhat but there are now large areas of consolidation in the right upper lobe anterior segment, left juxta hilar midline and right lung base. These findings suggest widespread pneumonia. Pleural effusions are smaller today. Heart is not enlarged. ET tube is in standard placement. Right PIC line ends below the SVC and an upper enteric drainage tube ends in the mid portion of moderately distended stomach. There is no pneumothorax.
