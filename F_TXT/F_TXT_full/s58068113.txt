Following left chest tube placement, left tension pneumothorax has substantially resolved. Small residual pneumothorax persists, but no evidence of tension. Small amount of pneumopericardium is likely related to recent surgery. Minimal atelectasis is present in the left lung base. There is no pleural effusion. Patient is status post median sternotomy, and sternal sutures are intact. Postoperative mediastinal widening and mildly enlarged heart size are stable. Endotracheal tube ends approximately 1.7 cm above the carina. Consider retracting the ET tube by 2 cm for appropriate seating. Orogastric tube ends into the stomach, and a Swan-Ganz catheter through the right internal jugular approach terminates approximately in the right main pulmonary artery.
