Large left pleural effusion has not changed over several days. Small to moderate residual right pleural effusion is also stable, despite the right thoracostomy tube. Tiny right apical pneumothorax is resolving. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable, but pulmonary edema if present is mild. Persistent bibasilar atelectasis is substantial, left greater than right. Feeding tube is looped many times in the left upper quadrant, but it could be entirely in the stomach. Right subclavian central venous infusion catheter ends in the upper right atrium. Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC.
