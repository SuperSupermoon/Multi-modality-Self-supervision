As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Massive air collection in the soft tissues, causing multiple horizontal lines that overlay the entire thorax, potential pneumothorax would be virtually impossible to diagnose. No evidence of pneumomediastinum. No change in appearance of the hemidiaphragms and of the lung parenchyma. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
