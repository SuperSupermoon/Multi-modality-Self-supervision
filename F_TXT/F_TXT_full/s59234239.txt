An endotracheal tube terminates 5.1 cm above the carina. Again seen is a markedly elevated right hemidiaphragm. There is mild central pulmonary vascular congestion with interstitial edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, larger on the right. An orogastric tube extends into the stomach. Since the prior examination, there has been worsening of mild-to-moderate interstitial edema and pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
