The tube should be advanced by approximately 3 cm, since the tip currently projects 8.5 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube shows an unchanged course. The known vertebral fractures are not manifest on the chest x-ray. The appearance of the ribs is unchanged. No pneumothorax, no pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema.
