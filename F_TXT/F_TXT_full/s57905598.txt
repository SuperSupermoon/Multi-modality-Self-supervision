1. Interval removal of the endotracheal tube with placement of a tracheostomy tube, which has its tip 4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified on the current study. Right subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. There has been a median sternotomy with CABG and overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There are small bilateral layering effusions. Calcified nodule at the right lung base likely represents a granuloma. Overall, the pulmonary vasculature appears less well defined and there is increase in opacity on the right side relative to the left. These findings would suggest worsening pulmonary edema, although an infectious process should also be considered given the asymmetry. Clinical correlation would be advised. No large pneumothorax seen on the supine radiograph.
