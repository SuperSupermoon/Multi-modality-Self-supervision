Tip of right PICC terminates in the mid superior vena cava. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but similar in size to the prior radiograph, and corresponding to a known pericardial effusion on prior CT abdomen of ___. Low lung volumes accentuate the pulmonary vascularity. Within the lungs, there is improving opacity in the left retrocardiac region, likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion. Small right pleural effusion with adjacent basilar atelectasis appears similar allowing for differences in lung volumes between the two studies.
