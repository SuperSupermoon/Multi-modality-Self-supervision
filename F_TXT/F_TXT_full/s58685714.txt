In comparison with the study of ___, there are bilateral pigtail catheters at the bases. There has been a substantial decrease in effusion on the right with reexpansion of the lung. On the left, there has been no decrease in effusion with increased amount of opacification along the left lateral chest wall. Some of this may represent loculated rather than free effusions. Monitoring and support devices remain in place, and there is again evidence of vascular congestion and cardiomegaly.
