AP chest compared to ___ through ___: What was previously a moderate to large right pleural effusion freely layering posteriorly, is smaller, but with a larger subpulmonic component. Lung volumes are generally smaller so that if there is any pulmonary edema, it is minimal. Bibasilar opacification is due to either worsening atelectasis or developing consolidation in the lower lobes, probably the former. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. There is no pneumothorax.
