Lung volumes are low. There are bibasilar heterogeneous opacities, which may represent atelectasis or consolidation. There is also a subtle wedge-shaped opacity in the right mid lung field. This may represent focal consolidation, or effusion tracking within the minor fissure. There are probable small bilateral pleural effusions. There is mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement. There is an endotracheal tube approximately 5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube courses the esophagus and is coiled within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, in the expected location of the stomach.
