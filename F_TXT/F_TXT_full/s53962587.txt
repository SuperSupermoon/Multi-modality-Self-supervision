Coarse reticular interstitial lung markings are again noted with slightly increased prominence at the right base, which is likely due to new atelectasis. There is little to no change in small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits. Midline surgical skin ___ in the upper neck are partially imaged.
