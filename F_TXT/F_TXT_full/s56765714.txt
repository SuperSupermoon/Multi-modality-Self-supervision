Compared to prior chest radiographs, ___ through ___. Volume of large left pleural effusion may have increased substantially but some of the change may be due to differences in patient positioning, currently more supine. Left lung is largely collapsed. Right lung relatively clear aside from basilar atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette partially obscured is probably not appreciably different than earlier when it was mildly enlarged. Transesophageal feeding tube passes yet through the distal stomach and out of view. Drainage tube ends in the mid portion of a nondistended stomach. Right jugular lines end in the mid SVC and close to the superior cavoatrial junction respectively. No pneumothorax.
