Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Persistent opacities in the left lower lobe suggest left lower lobe collapse. Right lower lobe opacity has increased, combination of pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. ET tube is in the standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Right PICC tip is in the right atrium, can be withdrawal approximately 3 cm for more standard position. Bilateral perihilar opacities larger on the right side have minimally increased on the right side, which could represent atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Mild pulmonary edema is stable.
