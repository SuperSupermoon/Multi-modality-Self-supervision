In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been removed and replaced with a tracheostomy tube. Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Cardiac silhouette is less prominent, though there does appear to be some indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels suggesting some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The right hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, consistent with improved atelectasis and effusion at the right base. On the left, there is again increased opacification consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and some left pleural fluid.
