As compared to the previous radiograph, the soft tissue air inclusion, previously limited to the left cervical and left lateral thoracic region is now generalized. It is visible over both the left and right thoracic and cervical regions. The intrathoracic findings appear to be unchanged. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position. A pneumothorax cannot be seen.
