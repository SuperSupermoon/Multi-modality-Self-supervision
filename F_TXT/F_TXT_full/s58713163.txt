There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube with tip projecting over the lateral aspect of the right mid lung field. Previously noted right-sided pneumothorax has decreased in size, now appearing small. There is new bandlike linear opacity in the right lung base, compatible with atelectasis. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Left lung remains grossly clear. Subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral chest wall is new.
