Given differences in positioning, the overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Calcification in the aortic knob is seen consistent with atherosclerosis. The lungs demonstrate interstitial prominence, which appears to be chronic. No evidence of pulmonary edema at this time. No focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Streaky opacities at the right base most likely reflect patchy atelectasis. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
