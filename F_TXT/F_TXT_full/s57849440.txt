Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous. Worsening diffuse ground-glass opacities with new vascular indistinctness is present. This is superimposed on a background of increased interstitial markings with ground-glass opacification previously thought to reflect NSIP. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
