Left-sided pacer remains in place with leads terminating over expected location of right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. The patient is status post median sternotomy. A metallic esophageal stent and coronary stent are unchanged in position. There is persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may reflect a small effusion and/or chronic pleural thickening. There has been interval improvement in the mild interstitial edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia or aspiration. No pneumothorax.
