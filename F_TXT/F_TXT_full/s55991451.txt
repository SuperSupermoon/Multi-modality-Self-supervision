As compared to ___ radiograph, right internal jugular dialysis catheter has been placed, terminating deep within the right atrium. Airspace opacities in the right lung have substantially improved with residual minimal perihilar edema remaining. There remains more extensive perihilar consolidation on the left, which could reflect asymmetric edema with or without coexisting pneumonia. Left lower lobe atelectasis and small to moderate left pleural effusion persist.
