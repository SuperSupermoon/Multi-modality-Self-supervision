There is slight increase in elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with atelectasis. A left pleural effusion is tiny if present. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The aorta is tortuous. A single lead pacemaker/ defibrillator device is present, with the lead ending in the region of the right ventricle. There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation.
