There has been interval removal of the previously placed left-sided PICC line. The heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The lungs are clear. There is no large pneumothorax and subtle blunting of the left costophrenic angle may represent pleural thickening, especially given the lateral rib irregularities of the left hemithorax, compatible with prior old/healed rib fractures.
