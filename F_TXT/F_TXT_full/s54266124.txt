Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragm. However, there is right base opacity that could be due to infection, aspiration, or metastatic disease. There is also patchy left mid lung opacity, increased since the prior study. Recommend followup to resolution. Left-sided port is again seen, terminating in the right atrium. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. There is slight prominence of the ascending aorta, as seen on prior chest CT.
