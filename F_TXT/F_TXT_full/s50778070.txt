Lung volumes are much lower than earlier in the day, but nevertheless it can be seen that the extent of pulmonary opacification has advanced considerably. Only the base of the right lung laterally is spared what has be come confluent consolidation, previously ground-glass opacification. This sequence of events, morphologic features, and distribution do not favor cardiogenic edema. Instead, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary drug reaction, and noncardiogenic edema are more likely, even though the heart is probably mildly enlarged. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial. Newly placed endotracheal tube is in standard position. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC and nasogastric tube ends in the nondistended stomach.
