Large bilateral layering pleural effusions are difficult to compare to the prior study due to apparent slight positional differences. With this limitation in mind, there has probably not been an appreciable change since the recent study. Diffuse haziness in the upper abdomen is suggestive of ascites, and there is likely a component of anasarca as well. Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position.
