Since the last radiograph performed earlier today, there has been interval placement of a tracheostomy tube which terminates approximately 4 cm above carina. The enteric tube and endotracheal tube have been removed. The left sided PICC line is unchanged in position terminating in the distal SVC. Bilateral pleural effusions appear to have improved since the prior CXR performed earlier today, but this may partially be due to patient position. There is no pneumothorax. There are no changes to the cardial mediastinal silhouette.
