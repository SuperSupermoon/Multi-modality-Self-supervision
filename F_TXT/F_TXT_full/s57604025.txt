An NG tube is present. The tip overlies the proximal stomach. The side port lies in the region of the GE junction, not definitively beyond it. The ET tube tip lies approximately 3.2 cm above the carina. There are low inspiratory volumes. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but grossly unchanged. There is a large left pleural effusion, with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Also again seen are increased markings, non-specific but consistent with CHF. Slightly more confluent opacity at the right lung base is consistent with right base collapse and/or consolidation and is similar to the prior film. Possible trace right pleural effusion.
