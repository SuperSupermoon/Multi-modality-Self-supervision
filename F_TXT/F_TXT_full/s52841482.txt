AP chest compared to ___, 1:51 p.m. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is larger and moderate right pleural effusion largely layering posteriorly, has increased, there may be mild perihilar edema evident in the left lung. Although the presence of accumulating mediastinal fluid is not excluded, cardiac decompensation and/or volume overload could explain all the findings. Swan-Ganz catheter is looped in the main pulmonary artery and probably returns through the pulmonary outflow tract. ET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view and a left pleural and midline drains are still in place. No pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged at 10:20 a.m. within a minute of my recognizing the findings.
