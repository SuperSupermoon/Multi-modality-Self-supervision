Increased opacification of the left hemi thorax, progressive widening of the pleural margin, and some increase in rightward mediastinal shift all point to increasing left pleural effusion, not surprising since the left pleural drain has been partially withdrawn, now close to the intercostal plane. Its side port in the left chest wall could drain pleural contents into the subcutaneous tissue. Given the multiple displaced left rib fractures, hemothorax should be the first consideration. Left heart border is obscured but the heart appears larger, explaining new mild edema in the right lung. No pneumothorax.
