An endotracheal tube is in unchanged position 5.1 cm from the carina. Since the prior exam, the catheter in the right main stem bronchus has been removed. There is a new valve overlying the right hilum. Its exact positioning is difficult to determine on this single AP view. A right chest tube is in unchanged position. Since prior exam, the right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. There is increased linear consolidation in the right mid lung zone, likely due to increased atelectasis. The opacity at the right base is unchanged. There is likely a tiny right pleural effusion. The left lung is clear without an opacity. A small left pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no left pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
