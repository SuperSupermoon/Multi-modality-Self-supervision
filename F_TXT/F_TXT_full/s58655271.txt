As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.7 cm above the carina. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. As compared to yesterday, there is a peripheral parenchymal consolidation of moderate extent. The change projects over the left costophrenic sinus and shows several air bronchograms. Given that the change was not present several hours ago, it most likely reflects atelectasis, potentially related to intubation. Close monitoring, however, is required to exclude developing pneumonia.
