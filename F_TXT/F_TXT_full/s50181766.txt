AP chest compared to ___: There are no findings to suggest pneumonia. Pulmonary vascular congestion is more pronounced, but there is no appreciable edema and no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Heart size is top normal. Widening of the mediastinum is comparable, and although does not exclude recent recurrence of dissection, it does not necessarily suggest it. The very large goiter is difficult to detect on the conventional radiograph.
