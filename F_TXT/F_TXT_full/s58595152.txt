Following left thoracentesis, there has been decrease in size of left pleural effusion with residual moderate effusion remaining, and no visible pneumothorax. A large, mass-like area of consolidation in the left upper lobe is again demonstrated as well as a smaller mass in the periphery of the right upper lobe and smaller pulmonary nodules, better visualized on recent CT chest of ___. As compared to the recent study, there has been some improved aeration at the left lung base, likely due to improving atelectasis adjacent to the decreased effusion. Bilateral interstitial opacities have slightly worsened, and may reflect interstitial edema and less likely lymphangitic spread of tumor given the rapid change.
