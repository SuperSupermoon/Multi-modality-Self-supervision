Since prior study, there has been no interval change in position of right chest wall Port-A-Cath, terminating in the upper right atrium, as well as a left chest wall pulse generator, with dual lead pacing wires terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Median sternotomy wires are intact. A right pleural effusion has slightly increased compared to the prior study, along with fluid tracking along the horizontal fissure on the right, and subsegmental atelectasis in the right lung base. Left basilar atelectasis is also increased, as has a small left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Biapical pleural thickening is stable. The overall heart size is unchanged.
