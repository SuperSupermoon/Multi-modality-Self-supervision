AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. The chest appearance on the frontal views can be compared. They demonstrate unchanged appearance of previously described pacer and ICD device. A new right-sided internal jugular approach catheter has been advanced and reaches the central portion of the right pulmonary artery. The patient is now intubated, the ETT is seen in the trachea to terminate some 4 cm above the level of the carina. Pulmonary vasculature is more engorged but no pulmonary central edema pattern or pleural effusion can be seen on this portable examination. Manipulating the density dial, it is possible to identify a grid pattern of a CoreValve device overlying expected left ventricular outflow tract, in the aortic valve and proximal ascending aorta area. The presence of several circular metallic wires indicates that new fixation of sternum was also performed. Further detail cannot be extracted from this single portable chest view, short of stating that there is no evidence of pneumothorax remaining.
