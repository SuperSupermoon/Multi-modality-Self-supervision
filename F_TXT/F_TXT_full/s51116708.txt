Portable semi-upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube tip located at least 2.3 cm from the level of the carina. A left subclavian central venous catheter tip is at the confluence of the SVC and brachiocephalic vein, with its tip projecting laterally against the wall of the SVC. An NG tube is in place, superimposed on the stomach, though the tip is not seen off the inferior margin of the film. Low lung volumes are slightly decreased with bibasilar opacities and bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Mild edema is unchanged. Calcified mitral valve annulus is again noted.
