As compared to the recent radiograph of earlier today, there is now near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax, which appears to correspond to a combination of known large loculated fluid collection and collapse of the left lower lobe in this patient status post left upper lobe resection. Within the right hemi thorax, mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.
