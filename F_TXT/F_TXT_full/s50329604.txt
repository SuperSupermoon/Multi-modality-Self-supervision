In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the PICC line lies within the right atrium. It could be pulled back approximately 2 cm to definitely be at or above the cavoatrial junction. Prominence of the cardiac silhouette is again seen. The pulmonary vessels are more engorged and indistinct, consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Basilar opacifications probably reflect small pleural effusion underlying atelectatic changes. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
