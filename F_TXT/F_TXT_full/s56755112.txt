There is a left-sided PICC line with the distal lead tip now pointing inferiorly and in the mid SVC. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are again seen. The nasogastric tube is coiled upon itself and its distal tip is now pointing cranially at the level the GE junction. This could be readjusted. There is unchanged cardiomegaly. There are bilateral pleural effusions and a left retrocardiac opacity. There are no pneumothoraces.
