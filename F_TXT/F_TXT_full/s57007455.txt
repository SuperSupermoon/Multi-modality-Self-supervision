Frontal view of the chest was obtained. Lung volumes are low, exaggerating heart size and bronchovascular markings. The heart is mildly enlarged. Patchy perihilar opacities and indistinct pulmonary vascular markings are compatible with pulmonary edema. No definite focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is visualized. The osseous structures are unremarkable. A lower thoracic spine posterior fusion construct with pedicle screws and vertical fusion rods is incompletely imaged.
