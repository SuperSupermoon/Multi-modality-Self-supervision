INTERVAL REMOVAL OF ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE. LEFT CHEST TUBE REMAINS IN PLACE, WITH SMALL LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION AND PROBABLE SMALL LOCULATED PNEUMOTHORAX ADJACENT TO THE CHEST TUBE. IMPROVING CONFLUENT OPACITY IN LEFT RETROCARDIAC REGION, BUT DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW FOCUS OF AIRSPACE OPACITY IN THE LEFT APEX. CONSIDERING THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT, THIS MOST LIKELY REPRESENTS ACUTE ASPIRATION. FOLLOWUP RADIOGRAPHS MAY BE HELPFUL TO EXCLUDE DEVELOPING PNEUMONIA IN THIS REGION.
