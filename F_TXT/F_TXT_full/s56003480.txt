Low lung volumes are present. Heart size is accentuated as result, appearing mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema. Minimal patchy opacities within the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
