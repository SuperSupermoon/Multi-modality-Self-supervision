In comparison with the earlier study of this date, following attempted chest tube placement, there is little change and no evidence of acute pneumothorax. Extensive opacification is again seen throughout the left hemithorax and there is no change in the appearance of the subclavian PICC line. Right lung remains essentially clear.
