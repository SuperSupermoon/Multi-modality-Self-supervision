CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ 7:58 a.m., the ET tube, NG tube and right IJ line have been removed. Again seen is cardiomegaly, left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and left greater than right effusions, unchanged. Also again seen is upper zone redistribution and diffusely increased interstitial markings. Depending on the clinical scenario, this could represent either CHF or an infectious or inflammatory interstitial process. The dense opacity in the right lung laterally is significantly improved, with only faint residua appreciated. Vertebral body endplate scalloping and T12 vertebral compression fracture again noted. Known rib fractures not well demonstrated on these views.
