As compared to the previous image, the position of the right chest tube is unchanged. In unchanged manner, there is a millimetric right apical pneumothorax but no evidence of tension is seen. The lung volumes remain very low. Increasing diameters of the vascular structures are strongly indicative of developing valley pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
