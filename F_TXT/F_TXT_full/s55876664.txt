ET tube is unchanged. NG tube tip is poorly visualized. Lung volumes are low and there is near-complete opacification of both hemithoraces likely due to alveolar infiltrate although there could also be an element of layering effusion. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The overall impression is that of worsened fluid status. An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be totally excluded.
