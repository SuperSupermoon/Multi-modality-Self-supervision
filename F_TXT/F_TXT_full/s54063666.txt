Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 10:44 p.m. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The ET tube tip is 4.4 cm above the carina. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance. Old rib fractures are redemonstrated as well as minimal atelectasis. Fullness adjacent to the left hilus most likely reflects the consolidation, better appreciated on the CT torso in the left lower lobe.
