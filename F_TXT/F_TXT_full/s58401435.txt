Following removal of a left-sided chest tube, a tiny left apical pneumothorax has developed. Other support and monitoring devices have been removed with residual right internal jugular vascular sheath remaining in place. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present as well as minimal interstitial edema and development of a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent right lower lobe atelectasis. Focal atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region is also new as well as a band-like area of linear atelectasis in the left mid lung region. Poorly defined opacity in the periphery of the right upper lobe is a nonspecific finding and could reflect focal atelectasis, aspiration, or early, developing pneumonia.
