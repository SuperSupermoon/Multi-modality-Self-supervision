Single portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates severe background emphysematous changes with relative lucency of the lungs and increased reticular nodular opacifications in the lung bases, left greater than right, the latter possibly representing developing infectious process or simply atelectasis. Focal nodular opacification projecting over the right lower lung. Unclear if this is within the lung parenchyma or external to patient. Not present on prior chest CTs; recommend reevaluation with oblique radiographs or non-emergent chest CT. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
