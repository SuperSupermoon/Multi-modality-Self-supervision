Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with top-normal heart size. No pneumothorax. Consider repeat chest radiograph with improved inspiratory level and standard PA and lateral technique to allow more optimal assessment of the cardiovascular structures. If findings persist, consider echocardiogram for further evaluation.
