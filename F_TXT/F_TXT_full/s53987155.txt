AP single view of the chest shows interval improvement of neoesophagus distention with resolution of air-fluid level. The collection of contrast in the distal portion of the neoesophagus has reduced, although present since ___ and concerning for obstruction at the lower neoesophagus. Right lung volume is unchanged with stable right lung base opacity mainly due to right lower lobe atelectasis. The left lung is clear except for small linear opacity in the left costophrenic angle, probably due to a small atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There is no pneumothorax.
