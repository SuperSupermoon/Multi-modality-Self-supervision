Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. A right-sided chest port is noted, terminating at the cavoatrial junction. New since the prior examination, there is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Focal consolidation is not entirely excluded, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
