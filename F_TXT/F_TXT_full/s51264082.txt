Tracheal tube tip lies 4.6 cm above the carina and is without change from examination at 13:24 hours of one day earlier. NG tube and right IJ line noted as before. Compared to the previous examination, there is increasing haziness/opacification in the left lower lung and lingula. It is difficult to assess for volume loss and mediastinal shift due to patient rotation.
