Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to prior, possibly minimally larger. . Presumed aortic balloon pump. This probably lies slightly higher than on the prior study, nowat the level of the inferior aortic knob lumen.

Findings in the right cardiophrenic region are more pronounced. No gross effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
