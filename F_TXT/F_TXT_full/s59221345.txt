The patient is rotated to the left. The ET tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina. There is no pneumothorax. An NG tube courses below the diaphragm and terminates outside the field of view. The left PICC terminates in the low SVC. Differences in the the left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis are difficult to ascertain due to patient positioning. There may be volume loss at the left lung base, which would be reflect worsening left lower lobe atelectasis.
