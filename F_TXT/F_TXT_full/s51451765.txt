The previously malpositioned endotracheal tube is repositioned and the tip now projects 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is in unchanged position, the course is normal. Newly developed massive bilateral predominantly perihilar parenchymal opacities with a consolidation component and a small peripheral opacity component containing air bronchograms. There also are smaller peripheral parenchymal opacities throughout the lung parenchyma. The image suggests a combination of acute cardiogenic and, potentially, vascular permeability edema. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions.
