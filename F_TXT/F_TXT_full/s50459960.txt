An endotracheal tube terminates 3.8 cm above the carinal. A right internal jugular catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. A nasogastric tube is coiled within the stomach. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable from the most recent prior exam. Bibasilar opacities, which could be related to atelectasis or aspiration are stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is decreased interstitial prominence from the prior examination consistent with improved pulmonary edema.
