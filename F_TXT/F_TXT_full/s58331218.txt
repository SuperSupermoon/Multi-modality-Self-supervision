An interstitial abnormality has improved substantially. There is suggestion of persistent reticulation in the lower lungs, however, which suggests underlying interstitial disease, as was reported previously. There is no focal opacification suggestive of pneumonia. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Although difficult to exclude, there are no definite pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
