As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Likely small left pleural effusion with subsequent areas of atelectasis. Moderate pulmonary edema with no evidence of a right-sided pleural effusion. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. In the interval, the left PICC line persists but the right central venous access line has been removed.
