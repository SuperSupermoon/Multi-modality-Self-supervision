AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and chest CT from ___. The patient is extubated with removal of the NG tube. The surgical drain is in unchanged position in the right hemithorax. Epidural catheter is in place. As compared to prior examination, there is no substantial interval change in the left lower lobe consolidation and right lower lobe opacity with the latter most likely being minimally improved. On the other hand, there is interval progression of left upper mid lung opacities that might reflect interval development of pneumonia. No interval development of pneumothorax or increase in pleural effusion is demonstrated. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
