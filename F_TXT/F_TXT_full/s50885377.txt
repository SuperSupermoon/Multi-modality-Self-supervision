As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient is still intubated, carries a nasogastric tube and right internal jugular vein catheter. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The extensive opacity at the right lung base, potentially combined to a small right pleural effusion, has minimally decreased in extent and severity. In the left lung, a small retrocardiac atelectasis is visible. Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
