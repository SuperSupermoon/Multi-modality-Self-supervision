Small left apical pneumothorax is unchanged, but a small right apical pneumothorax has nearly resolved. Right chest tube and left pigtail pleural catheter remain in place. Large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobes is unchanged, but a left pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size. Otherwise, no relevant changes since recent radiograph.
