AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. Marked increase of pulmonary vascular congestive pattern with prominent perivascular haze and beginning central edema. A right internal jugular approach was used for the pacing wire, seen to reach the diaphragmatic level via the cardiac area of the right atrium. The wire tip, however, points downwards being directed into the inferior vena cava or possibly entering in an aberrant posterior interventricular coronary vein. Precise termination point must be decided by EKG of electrical capture. The typical structure of a CoreValve can be identified in the area of the left ventricular outflow and root of aorta. There is no pneumothorax.
