He compared to chest radiograph ___ at 19:20 and chest CT a ___ at 21:40. Previous bilateral upper lobe consolidation has worsened, now accompanied by moderate pulmonary edema elsewhere. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. Upper mediastinum is wider. There is no way to distinguish mediastinal bleeding from mediastinal venous engorgement which could be due to volume bloating or biventricular cardiac decompensation. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. ET tube has been advanced, tip now no more than 15 mm from the carina. Since the chin is elevated, this is 2 cm below optimal placement. Esophageal drainage tube ends in the distal portion of a nondistended stomach. No central venous line is noted.
