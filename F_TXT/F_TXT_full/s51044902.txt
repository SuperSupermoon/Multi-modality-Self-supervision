As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a mild increase in the diameter of the pulmonary vessels, potentially indicative of mild fluid overload. In addition, the atelectasis at the left lung base has increased in extent and there is blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small left pleural effusion. No cardiomegaly. Unchanged tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pneumothorax.
