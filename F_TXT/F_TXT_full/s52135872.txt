AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has worsened since ___. This is accompanied by considerable increase in caliber of the right hilar vessels. It is possible that a mucoid impaction in dilated bronchus could be obscured by this vascular dilatation, particularly in the right lower lung zone. There is some attenuation of the left main bronchus, relative to its caliber on ___, but this can be due to displacement by an interval enlargement of the left atrium which I believe has occurred. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses. Overall, findings suggest "cardiac asthma."
