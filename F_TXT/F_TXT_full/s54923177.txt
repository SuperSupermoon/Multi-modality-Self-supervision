As compared to the previous radiograph, contrast is noted from a prior fluoroscopy. The contrast extends along the known large hiatal hernia. The left pleural drainage device is in unchanged position. No larger left pleural effusion but a mild to moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. Moderate atelectasis at the right lung bases. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema.
