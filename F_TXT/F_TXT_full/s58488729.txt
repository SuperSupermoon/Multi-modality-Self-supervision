Lung volumes are lower than before. There is considerable improvement in bilateral pulmonary opacities. Asymmetric density is again noted at the right lung base, but this has improved as well. A right chest tube remains in place. There is a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema on that side. The heart and mediastinal structures are unremarkable and unchanged. An endotracheal tube remains in place.
