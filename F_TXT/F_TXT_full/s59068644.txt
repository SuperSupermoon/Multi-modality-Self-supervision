Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated slightly. There is mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Subtle bibasilar opacities likely relate to atelectasis. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, though likely accentuated by AP technique. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
