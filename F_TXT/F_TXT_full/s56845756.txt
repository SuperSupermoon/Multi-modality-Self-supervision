Opacification is somewhat greater at the right lung base today than yesterday. This is probably due to worsening lower lobe aeration, either atelectasis or pneumonia. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are also increased. Heart size is normal. Upper lungs are clear. No pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Right subclavian line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
