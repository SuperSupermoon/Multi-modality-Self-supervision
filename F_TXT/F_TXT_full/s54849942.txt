1. Patient is markedly rotated on the current examination. Heart remains stably enlarged. Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given patient rotation. Right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. The endotracheal tube likely has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. The right pleural effusion appears somewhat decreased. There is a layering left effusion with associated consolidation in the retrocardiac region, likely reflecting partial lower lobe collapse, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Overall, the pulmonary vasculature appears somewhat ill-defined, which could reflect a component of interstitial edema. No pneumothorax is seen. Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
