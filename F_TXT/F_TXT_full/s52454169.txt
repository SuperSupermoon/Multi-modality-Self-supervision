Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Lung volumes are low which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which remains markedly enlarged. Superior mediastinal widening is also likely due to low lung volumes, and is similar compared to the prior study. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy atelectasis is seen in the lung bases without focal consolidation. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Assessment of the left apex is somewhat obscured by external device. Tracheostomy tube tip is in unchanged position.
