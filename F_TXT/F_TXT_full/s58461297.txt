Tracheostomy tube is in place with tip terminating in the proximal intrathoracic trachea, approximately 4.9 cm above the carina. There is no evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Feeding tube has been exchanged for a nasogastric tube, which terminates in the stomach. Other indwelling devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable since the prior study. Bilateral predominantly alveolar opacities affecting the right lung to a greater degree than the left show some interval improvement in the right mid and lower lung regions. This may represent a combination of pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia. Bilateral pleural effusions are again demonstrated, slightly improved on the right and unchanged on the left.
