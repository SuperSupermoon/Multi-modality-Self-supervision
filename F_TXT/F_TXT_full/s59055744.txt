A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a right PICC, which courses superiorly into the right internal jugular vein. Lung volumes are low, resulting in increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Allowing for this, heart size is likely normal. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
