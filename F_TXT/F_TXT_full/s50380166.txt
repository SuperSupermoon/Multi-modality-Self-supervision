The heart size is mildly enlarged but likely similar to prior study given differences in technique. The mediastinal contours demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic disease at the aortic knob and a mildly tortuous aorta, following the curvature of a mildly dextroscoliotic spine. The previously described right mid lung opacity has resolved. In the retrocardiac region, there is increased opacity. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Severe degenerative changes are seen in the bilateral glenohumeral joints. Scoliosis and compressive deformities appear likely unchanged.
