Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates a new fiducial marker positioned below the level of the carina. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The lung volumes are low and there is some plate-like atelectasis at the left lung base. No evidence of focal pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. The previously seen right-sided port is unchanged in standard position.
