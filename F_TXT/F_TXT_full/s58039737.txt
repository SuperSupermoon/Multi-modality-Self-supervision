1. Interval appearance of bilateral layering pleural effusions and associated airspace opacity which most likely reflects compressive atelectasis, although a pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Right-sided pacer in place. No pneumothorax. Relative paucity of vasculature in the apices suggests a component of underlying emphysema.
