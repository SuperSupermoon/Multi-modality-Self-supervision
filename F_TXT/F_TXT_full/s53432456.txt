The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. Emphysematous changes are seen throughout the lungs. Reticular opacities are seen in the bilateral lower lung fields. Somewhat increased opacity is noted in the right mid lung in comparison to the recent CT chest including a peripheral nodular opacity, not definitively seen on prior examination. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
