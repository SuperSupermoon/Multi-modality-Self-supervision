Single portable view of the chest. There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube whose tip is 4 cm from the carina. Enteric tube is seen at the region of the distal esophagus and potentially off the inferior field of view although not well seen secondary to technique. Appearance of the lungs has not significantly changed. Obscuration of the hemidiaphragms is thought to be due to positioning and technique. There is no large confluent consolidation.
