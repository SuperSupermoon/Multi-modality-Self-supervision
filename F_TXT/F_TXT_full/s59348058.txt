Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.5 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube courses below the level the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image. There are low lung volumes. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly unremarkable. Partially imaged lucency projecting over the soft tissue of the left lateral neck may represent subcutaneous emphysema in the setting of penetrating neck injury.
