The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The lungs show no consolidation or overt evidence of pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacity medially is compatible with hiatal hernia. Old appearing left upper rib fractures are present. There are also fractures of right upper ribs, including posterior right ___ and 6th ribs, likely old, but not clearly seen on the prior chest radiograph. Correlate clinically for acuity. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
