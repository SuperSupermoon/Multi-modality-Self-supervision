Since the prior exam, the bilateral pleural effusions have slightly increased in size. Associated bibasilar consolidations are new and most likely represent a combination of new edema and atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac size is severely enlarged and not significantly changed from prior exam. The mediastinal contours are normal. Notably, the vascular pedicle has not increased in width to suggest progression of tamponade physiology. A pericardial drain is seen overlying the cardiac silhouette, although the tip of the catheter is not well seen.
