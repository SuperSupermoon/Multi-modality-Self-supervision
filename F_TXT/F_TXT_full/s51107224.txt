Lungs are chronically mildly hyper inflated. Right lung is clear of any focal abnormality. Previous fractures in the lateral right middle rib should not be mistaken for lung lesions. Left lung is generally clear, but there is recurrent obscuration of the descending thoracic aorta which could be due to adjacent atelectasis in the lower lobe, that has worsened since ___ when bronchiectasis was visible in the posterior basal segment ; this may be responsible for new segmental collapse. Evaluation of the airway is would require chest CT scanning. Heart size is normal. There is no pleural abnormality.
