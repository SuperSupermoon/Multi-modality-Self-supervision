A single frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Since ___:45 p.m., bilateral pleural effusions have increased, left more than right, with adjacent atelectasis. Pulmonary vasculature is less distinct, compatible with new mild pulmonary edema. The heart size cannot be evaluated due to the large effusions. There is no pneumothorax. A left central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC, unchanged.
