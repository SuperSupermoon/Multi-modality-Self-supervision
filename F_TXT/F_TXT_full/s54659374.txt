The right lung volume is significantly decreased when compared to prior studies. This may be due to worsening of right lower lobar atelectasis with possible involvement of the right middle lobe and less likely worsening of a right pleural effusion. The volume loss of atelectasis exceeds the volume replacement of the pleural effusion, evidenced by an increased right mediastinal shift. A small left pleural effusion. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is stable. Left pacemaker is intact with leads in the appropriate location. The right central venous catheter terminates in the cavoatrial junction. A fracture of the first sternotomy wire is new. The remaining sternotomy wires are intact.
