ET and NG tube are nominal in position. Cardiomegaly could be slightly more pronounced. Again seen are bilateral right greater left effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Also again seen is CHF, with upper zone redistribution, vascular plethora and probable vascular blurring. On today's exam, there is increased obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm, which could reflect increased collapse/ consolidation at the right base. Biapical pleural scarring, with surface calcification again noted. There is also nearby vascular calcification.
