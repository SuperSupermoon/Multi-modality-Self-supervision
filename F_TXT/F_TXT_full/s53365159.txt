Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval improvement in the extent of pulmonary edema compared to yesterday. There is right lower lobe collapse and extensive atelectasis of the left lower lobe, both of which have progressed. The left costophrenic angle now appears sharper, indicating interval clearance of the pleural effusion. There is likely persistent small right pleural effusion. The upper lung fields are clear. Slight widening of the upper mediastinum is consistent with vascular engorgement. There is no pneumothorax. The new right internal jugular central venous catheter along with the pre-existing right internal jugular catheter terminates appropriately in the lower SVC. An endotracheal tube terminates no less than 4.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view.
