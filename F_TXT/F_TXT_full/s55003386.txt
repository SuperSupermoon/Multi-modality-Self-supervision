A NG tube is present and terminates within the stomach. The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. The cardiac, mediastinal and pleural structures are unremarkable. The previously seen markedly distended stomach appears decompressed on this study. Air-filled loops of nondilated colon are noted.
