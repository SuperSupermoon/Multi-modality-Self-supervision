Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. There is persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Mediastinal contours are stable. Right-sided PICC terminates in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. A right pleural effusion persists. Right base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis with some mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Overall, pulmonary vascular congestion appears slightly improved as compared to the prior study.
