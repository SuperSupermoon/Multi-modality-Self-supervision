As on the prior study there is a large right effusion and volume loss in the right lower lobe. On the prior exam there was a small amount of opacity in the retrocardiac region. This is now more confluent and is more suspicious for an infectious infiltrate. The upper lobes are relatively clear. The right IJ line is unchanged.
