Evaluation is somewhat limited by overlying trauma board. An endotracheal tube terminates 2.3 cm above the level of the carina. And oral gastric tube is seen terminating within the stomach. A left-sided central venous line terminates near the cavoatrial junction. There is a dual lead left pectoral pacemaker noted. Surgical clips are noted within the right upper abdomen. A vascular stent overlies the right upper lobe. The left lung is nearly completely opacified, obscuring the left cardiac border and left hemidiaphragm. A left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. A vague opacity overlies the left lung apex, potentially concerning for underlying aortic injury. The right lung demonstrates mild basilar atelectasis and is otherwise grossly clear. There is no right pleural effusion. Heavy atherosclerotic calcification is seen within the aortic arch.
