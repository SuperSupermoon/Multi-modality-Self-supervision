Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has improved. Atelectasis unchanged at the base of the right lung, where the right hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated. Right hilar enlargement is probably vascular, should be followed at least with conventional chest radiographs. Tracheostomy tube slightly turned, tip abutting the left tracheal wall. Left subclavian line ends in the SVC.
