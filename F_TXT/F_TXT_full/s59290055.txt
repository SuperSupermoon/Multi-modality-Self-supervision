A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device is present. The heart is normal in size. The aortic arch is calcified. There is a large hiatal hernia with an air-fluid level projecting over the lower central mediastinum slightly to the right of midline. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Aside from streaky opacities, probably relating to the presence of the hernia, the lungs appear clear.
