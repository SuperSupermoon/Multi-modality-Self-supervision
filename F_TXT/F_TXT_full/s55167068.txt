The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. In the interval since the prior study, there is increase in interstitial markings bilaterally, particularly centrally, worrisome for worsening pulmonary edema. Right basilar opacity is again seen, which may be due to fluid overload, although an underlying consolidation is not excluded. Small right pleural effusion was better seen on CT as was left lower lobe opacities. Surgical clips are noted overlying the left upper mediastinum. Aortic knob calcifications again seen.
