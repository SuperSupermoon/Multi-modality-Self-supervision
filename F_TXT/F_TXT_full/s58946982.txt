Study is limited by patient rotation and portable technique; however, low lung volumes are appreciated, which accentuate the cardiomediastinal contours. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may indicate a small pleural effusion. No discreet consolidation is appreciated. Hilar and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
