Since there has been no chest radiography since ___, I cannot tell to what extent the previous abnormality, severe bibasilar consolidation, ever cleared. The consolidation in the lung bases today is certainly less pronounced, and may be the slowly resolving residual. Lateral to the right hilus however is a new small consolidative opacity that I do not believe was present on ___ and is therefore a new nidus of infection. Nevertheless lung volumes have improved substantially. Small left pleural effusion may have been present previously. Heart size is normal. Dual channel right transjugular catheter ends in the low SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
