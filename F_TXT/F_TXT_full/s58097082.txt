Semi upright portable AP view of the chest was provided. There is marked globular cardiomegaly which raises concern for possible pericardial effusion. Diffuse pulmonary edema is also noted. No large pleural effusions are present. Tiny clips project over the superior mediastinum likely due reflect prior thyroidectomy. Bony structures appear intact. Overlying EKG lead and external pacer device is seen.
