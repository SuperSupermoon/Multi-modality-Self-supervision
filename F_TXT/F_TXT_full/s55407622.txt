Low lung volumes cause bibasilar atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding. Allowing for this, airspace opacities in the right lung base and retrocardiac region may represent atelectasis or early consolidation. There is no pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No evidence for pneumoperitoneum.
