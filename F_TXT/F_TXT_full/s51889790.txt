AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Status post thoracotomy, moderate cardiac enlargement and evidence of aortic valve prosthesis as well as tricuspid valve annuloplasty as before. The removal of the right-sided pleural effusion of the preceding day remains successful as the right-sided diaphragmatic contour and pleural sinus is free, demonstrating the pigtail-end catheter in unchanged position. No pneumothorax has developed. The pulmonary vascular pattern again demonstrates perivascular haze throughout which in comparison appears slightly increased again. This may have led to question a left-sided pneumonia, a diagnosis which is questionable.
