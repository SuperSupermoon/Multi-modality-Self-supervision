As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing mild pulmonary edema has not increased in severity, nor extent. Although minimal pleural effusions are masqued by a large left ventricle on the left and ascending hemidiaphragm on the right, there is no indication for larger pleural effusions. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities. Unchanged course of the pacemaker leads.
