AP chest compared to ___, 9:29 p.m.: New endotracheal tube ends less than 2 cm above the carina and should be withdrawn 2.5 cm for optimal placement. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Lung volumes are lower and greater opacification in the left lower lobe is attributable to new atelectasis. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Right internal jugular line ends just below the superior cavoatrial junction, as before.
