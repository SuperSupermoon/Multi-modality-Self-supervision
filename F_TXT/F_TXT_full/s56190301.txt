Heart is normal size and cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. AICD leads are unchanged in position. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Enteric tube terminates in the proximal stomach. Port-A-Cath tip is in the lower SVC, as before. Lungs are clear. A faint asymmetric increase in density over the right mid/lower lung may be due to overlying soft tissues including the breast implant. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Multiple surgical clips are noted. Multiple bony metastases including sclerotic changes in the left humerus are best seen on the recent PET-CT from ___.
