As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been pulled back. The tip of the tube now projects 4 cm above the carina. There is increasing diffuse opacity at the left lung base, likely caused by a small pleural effusion. No other relevant changes. No pneumothorax. Unchanged aspect of the cardiac silhouette.
