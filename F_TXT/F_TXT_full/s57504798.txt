Right-sided pacer is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. Left-sided central venous catheter tip terminates in the proximal right atrium. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is present. Aortic knob calcifications are noted. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. A small left pleural effusion is substantially decreased in size compared to the previous study. Subsegmental atelectasis or scarring accounts for the linear opacity within the left mid lung field. There is minimal left basilar atelectasis. Right lung is clear. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is present.
