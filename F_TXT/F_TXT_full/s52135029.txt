Comparison is made to the previous study from ___. Heart size and mediastinum is within normal limits. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal lead tip is at the level of clavicular heads. Lungs are grossly clear allowing for the overlying subcutaneous emphysema. There is extensive amount of subq emphysema seen throughout all the visualized soft tissues particularly along the base of the neck. Please correlate with any recent intervention in these areas. No free intraabdominal gas is seen underneath the hemidiaphragms.
