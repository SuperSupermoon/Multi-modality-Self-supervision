Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the aortic knob and descending thoracic aorta. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Minimal patchy atelectasis is seen in both lung bases without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
