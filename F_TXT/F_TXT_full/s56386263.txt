Portable semi erect frontal image of the chest. There has been interval placement of right IJ line, which terminates at the cavoatrial junction. The lungs are well expanded. There are heterogeneous peribronchial markings in the lungs bilaterally, which could represent an atypical pneumonia or less likely pulmonary edema from heart failure. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
