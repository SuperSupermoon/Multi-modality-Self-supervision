As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The endotracheal tube has been minimally advanced, the tip of the tube now projects approximately 3.8 cm above the carina. The right and left internal jugular venous devices are unchanged. The course of the nasogastric tube is also unchanged. Mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions continue to be present. These effusions cause bilateral areas of atelectasis at the lung bases. In addition, signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema are seen only minimally worsened as compared to the previous image. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
