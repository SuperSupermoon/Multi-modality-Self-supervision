The patient has received a left chest tube. The amount of pleural fluid on the left has substantially decreased. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Small remnant left pleural effusion and retrocardiac atelectasis persists. Both the perihilar opacity on the left and the slightly increased lung parenchyma on the right are better ventilated than on the previous image.
