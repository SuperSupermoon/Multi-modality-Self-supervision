The patient is rotated slightly which limits assessment. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip appears to terminate in the mid SVC. Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position. Orogastric tube tip is within the stomach, though the side port is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Increased interstitial opacities diffusely are slightly more pronounced on the current exam, which may reflect mild pulmonary edema. Hazy opacification in the right lung base likely reflects a small layering pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine with compression deformity of a low thoracic vertebral body.
