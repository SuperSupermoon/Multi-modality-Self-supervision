The patient is status post recent median sternotomy and cardiovascular surgery. Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard position. Decrease width of cardiomediastinal contours compared to the recent radiograph as well as improved pulmonary vascular congestion and decreased right basilar atelectasis. However, left retrocardiac opacity has worsened and probably represents a combination of left lower lobe atelectasis and small effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax.
