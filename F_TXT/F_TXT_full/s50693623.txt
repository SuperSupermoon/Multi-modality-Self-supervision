AP chest compared to ___: Very little has changed radiographically in the chest over the past week. The heart is mildly enlarged. Upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is engorged. Both infrahilar lungs are partially consolidated, which could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia, but there is no pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Right PICC line ends 6.5 cm below the level of the carina, would need to be withdrawn 3 cm to reposition it with confidence, low in the SVC. Transvenous pacer defibrillator lead follows the expected course to the right ventricular apex. No pneumothorax.
