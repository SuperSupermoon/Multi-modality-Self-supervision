A left-sided PICC line has been retracted somewhat and terminates in the mid portion of the superior vena cava. The heart is moderately enlarged, as before. There is a suggestion of upper zone re-distribution of pulmonary vascularity, which suggests pulmonary venous hypertension, but congestive heart failure has largely resolved. A developing opacity is suspected in the right lower lung, however, but not optimally evaluated with portable technique. Streaky left basilar opacity probably is probably compatible with minor atelectasis. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
