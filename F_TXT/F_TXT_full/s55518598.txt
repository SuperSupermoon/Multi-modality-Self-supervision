The tip of the tracheostomy tube abuts the right tracheal wall and should be examined to see if it needs more support. Again seen is a dual channel left internal jugular line that ends in the upper SVC. A feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. There is a more discrete consolidation at the base of the left lung which could represent atelectasis or pneumonia. The heterogeneous, infiltrative pulmonary abnormality is again seen with an interval increase in the number of lucencies, which is concerning for possible barotrauma developing over the past few days. Again seen is cardiomegaly, unchanged from the prior study. There are no substantial pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
