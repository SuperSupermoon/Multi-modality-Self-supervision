A left-sided PICC line has been removed. The heart is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is persistent patchy opacity at the left lung base, suggesting a combination of atelectasis or consolidation and most likely with a small pleural effusion, but not well delineated. The pulmonary vasculature is indistinct and prominent suggesting mild vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax.
