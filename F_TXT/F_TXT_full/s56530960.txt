Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 08:11. The ET tube tip is 2.2 cm above the carina. The outside devices projecting over the mediastinum are unchanged. There is interval development of more pronounced right mediastinal shift most likely due to at least partial right upper lobe atelectasis with progression of the opacities compared to prior study, worrisome for aspiration as well as atelectasis. The appearance of the epicardial pacers is unchanged.
