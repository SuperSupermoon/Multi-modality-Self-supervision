In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of an ICD with the lead probably in the region of the apex of the right ventricle, though it has been excluded from the image. No evidence of pneumothorax. Scattered radiation related to the size of the patient greatly obscures detail. Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some element of pulmonary vascular congestion. The region behind the heart cannot be properly evaluated in the absence of a lateral view.
