A enteric tube has been placed terminating in the stomach with side port beyond expected location of the gastroesophageal junction. The endotracheal tube is in appropriate position, appearing closer to the carina than on previous same-day radiograph because the patient's chin is down. Moderate right and small left left pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis are stable. Vascular congestion is unchanged.
