Opacification of the lungs is relatively mild and generally symmetric, probably edema, and there is probably moderate pleural effusion layering largely posteriorly. In addition there appears to be more dense consolidation in the right upper lobe which could be pneumonia, particularly aspiration, following tracheal extubation. Heart size is normal. Nasogastric tube is loop several times in the stomach comparisons out of view. Right subclavian infusion port ends in the upper to mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
