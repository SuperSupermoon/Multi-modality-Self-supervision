The previously noted right left chest tubes have been removed. There is no definite pneumothorax. There is a large-bore catheter on the right with the tip in the SVC. There are bilateral pleural effusions. There is patchy consolidation in the left perihilar region. This is more pronounced than on the earlier study, but this may be accentuated by poor inspiratory effort. There is no CHF.
