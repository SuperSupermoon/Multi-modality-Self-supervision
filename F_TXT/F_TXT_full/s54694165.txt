AP chest compared to ___: Heterogeneous opacification in the mid and lower left lung is increasing. This could be a combination of asymmetric edema and dependent atelectasis but raises concern for pneumonia, particularly due to aspiration. Heart is normal size and low lung volumes exaggerate the pulmonary vascular caliber generally, but I doubt that there is substantial cardiac decompensation. Intestines in the upper abdomen are moderately to severely distended with air, and in the colon, formed stool. Clinical consideration should be given to the possibility of pathologic intestinal distention. There is no free subdiaphragmatic gas.
