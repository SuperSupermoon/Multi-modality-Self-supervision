1. Left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the proximal to mid SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip coiled within the stomach. Interval removal of the endotracheal tube. Interval removal of the right internal jugular central line. Pleural and abdominal drains remain in place. Left basilar chest tube remains in place. No definite pneumothorax is seen. Interval reduction in lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. Areas of probable patchy atelectasis within the right lung related to the interval decrease in lung volumes. Multiple bilateral rib fractures again are seen. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning and inspiration.
