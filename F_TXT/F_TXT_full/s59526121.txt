Again seen is extensive subcutaneous air tracking along the pectoralis muscles bilaterally. This limits assessment of the pulmonary parenchyma. An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip terminates 3.5 cm above the level the carina. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC. Widespread bilateral airspace opacities are similar in extent when compared to the prior study. No evidence of clearing.
