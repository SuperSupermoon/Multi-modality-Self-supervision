There are diffuse severe opacities in both lungs, especially in the periphery, which are worsening; these are more prominent in the right upper lobe and the left lower lobe. There are also small bilateral pleural effusions. Widened mediastinum is stable. Heart size cannot be assessed on this study. Right PICC is present whose tip cannot be clearly seen but likely resides in the upper SVC. Catheter projecting over the upper abdomen also seen.
