Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 03:16 a.m. The orogastric tube is in the stomach. The ET tube tip is too low, just at the level of the carina and should be pulled back approximately 2-3 cm. The hemodialysis catheter tip is in the right atrium. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged. The patient continues to be in mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Right lower lung opacity most likely reflects a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, but attention to this area to exclude the possibility of developing infection is required. No pneumothorax identified.
