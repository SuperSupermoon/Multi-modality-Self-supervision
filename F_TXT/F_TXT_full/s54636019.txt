AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. Left chest tube, left subclavian line, tracheostomy, hemodialysis catheter, and Dobbhoff tube are all in unchanged positions. Extensive widespread consolidations are unchanged, but there is questionable interval increase in the right pleural effusion and potentially right lower lobe consolidation that might represent developing focus of infection. No pneumothorax is seen.
