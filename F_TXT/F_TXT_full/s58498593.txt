Tracheostomy tube, left subclavian vascular catheter and feeding tube remain in standard position. Heart size is normal. Linear opacities are present in the left lower lobe and may represent a combination of bronchial wall thickening related to known bronchiectasis in this region as well as adjacent linear atelectasis or scarring. Similar but less prominent opacities are seen in the left perihilar region, and a large conglomerate cystic structure is evident in the left upper lobe, seen to better detail on CT of ___. No new areas of consolidation are evident to suggest an acute pneumonia, but followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude developing peribronchial infection in the left lower lobe.
