1. The right subclavian PICC line now has its tip in the mid SVC in satisfactory position. The right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the right atrium. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. 2. Relatively low lung volumes with crowding of the vasculature and likely residual perihilar edema. Left basilar airspace process appears slightly worsened and may reflect worsening lower lobe atelectasis. Pneumonia should also be considered. No large right effusion. No large pneumothorax on the supine film.
