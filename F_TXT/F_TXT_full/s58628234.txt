There has been no appreciable change in this study with unchanged position of bilateral pleural drains, mediastinal drains, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. Chest remains open with packing material in the midline obscuring the view of some of the tubes. A Swan-Ganz catheter is likely at the level of the pulmonic valve, though not definitely across it. The lungs remain clear. A small left effusion is not well seen on this study. Dense retrocardiac atelectasis is still present.
