AP chest compared to ___: Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has not changed appreciably in several days. Pleural effusions are small if any. Severe cardiomegaly and vascular engorgement in both lungs and the mediastinal veins are stable. Compared to ___, the right descending pulmonary artery has enlarged. This is probably due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance due to severe generalized hypoxia. If on the other hand, there are pulmonary emboli, that diagnosis would not explain the diffuse pulmonary opacification.
