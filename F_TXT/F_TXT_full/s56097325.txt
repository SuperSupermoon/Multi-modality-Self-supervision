Widespread fibrotic lung disease appears similar to the recent radiograph, but a superimposed consolidative opacity in left upper lobe peripherally has apparently worsened and could reflect a developing pneumonia or site of aspiration. Standard PA and lateral chest radiograph would be helpful for confirmation and characterization when the patient's condition permits.
