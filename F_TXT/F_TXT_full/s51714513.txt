Lung volumes are low resulting crowding of the pulmonary bronchovascular structures. This likely contributes to the appearance of congestive heart failure with borderline, cardiomegaly, prominent hila and prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. No consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen.
