Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with a slight increase in size of small-to-moderate right pleural effusion, but no visible pneumothorax. Large right upper lobe mass with adjacent mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy appear similar to the prior study and has been more fully evaluated by recent MRI of ___, which also demonstrates extensive right-sided pleural thickening consistent with malignant pleural disease. Left lung and pleural surfaces are grossly clear.
