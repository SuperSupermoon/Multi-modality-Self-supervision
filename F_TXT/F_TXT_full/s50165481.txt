An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2.7 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extends beneath off film. The does appear to be any side-port in the region of the GE junction, not clearly beyond it. Again seen is a PICC line with the tip near the GE junction, possibly over the upper most right atrium. No pneumothorax detected. There is increased retrocardiac density with air bronchograms, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and blunting of left costophrenic angle. This is overall similar the prior study, but the hemidiaphragm is less well seen on today's study, suggesting interval worsening. New slight leftward shift of the cardiac silhouette suggests volume loss at the left lung base. Again seen is hazy somewhat patchy opacity at the right base medially,, consistent with less pronounced atelectasis/infiltrate. .No right effusion. Mild upper zone redistribution could be accentuated by low lung volumes. Doubt overt CHF.
