AP chest compared to ___: Opacification at the base of the right hemithorax is at least a small pleural effusion but there could be consolidation there as well. Conventional frontal and lateral chest radiographs would be helpful in making the distinction. Mild atelectasis at the base of the left lung medially is the only abnormality on that side. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. No appreciable left pleural effusion.
