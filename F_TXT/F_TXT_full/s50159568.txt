Widespread predominantly interstitial, secondarily consolidative pulmonary abnormality has changed somewhat in distribution over the past several days, but not in overall severity. There is at least a small to moderate volume of pleural fluid on both sides of the chest and although the heart is not enlarged, the presumption is that some of the pulmonary abnormality is edema despite the diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia presumably responsible for much of the pulmonary abnormality. ET tube in standard placement. The large bore right supraclavicular central venous line ends in the upper SVC. The smaller right internal jugular line ends just above the origin of the SVC. Esophageal drainage tube can be traced as far as the low esophagus but the tip is indistinct.
