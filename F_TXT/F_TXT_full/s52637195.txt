The right PICC line ends in the approximate region of the cavoatrial junction, unchanged in overall position. Lung volumes remain low. Asymmetric opacity in the right upper lung, increasing on serial exams is concerning for a developing pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly persists and is overall unchanged. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is improved. The mediastinum appears widened, perhaps in part to the tortuosity of thoracic aorta as well as prominence of the venous system. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusion.
