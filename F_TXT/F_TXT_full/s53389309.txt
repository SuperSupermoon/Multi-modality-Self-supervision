In comparison with the study ___ ___, the nasogastric tube extends to the mid body of the stomach with the side port distal to the esophagogastric junction. Tracheostomy tube remains in place. The patient has taken a better inspiration. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and there is opacification in the retrocardiac region consistent with atelectatic changes at the left base. On this examination, the extensive i free ntraperitoneal gas below the hemidiaphragms is not appreciated in. However, this is presumably a supine image that would be insensitive for detecting free air. If this is a serious clinical concern, an upright view or CT would be necessary to document the amount of free gas in the abdomen.
