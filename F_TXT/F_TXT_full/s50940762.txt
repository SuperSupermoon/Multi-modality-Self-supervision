AP chest radiograph. In comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier at 7:07 p.m., there has been insertion of the NG tube with still slightly expanded stomach. The right PICC line has been adjusted with its tip currently being at the mid-to-low SVC. Minimal improvement in the aeration of the lungs is noted, but they are continuing to be extensively opacified with air bronchogram present. The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.
