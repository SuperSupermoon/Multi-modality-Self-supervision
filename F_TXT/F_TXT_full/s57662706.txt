Heart is upper limits of normal in size and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion, interstitial edema, and small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. The effusions have decreased in size compared to the previous exam, and the extent of basilar atelectasis is also reduced. Note is also made of questionable pneumopericardium as well as a subtle lucency adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm. Although these findings may be projectional in nature, further evaluation with a left lateral decubitus abdominal radiograph may be helpful to exclude the possibility of free intraperitoneal air and to re-assess the questionable pneumopericardium.
