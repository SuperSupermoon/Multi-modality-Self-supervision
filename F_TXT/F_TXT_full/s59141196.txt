Right-sided PICC has migrated proximally and terminates in the right subclavian vein, high in position. Single lead left AICD is seen, unchanged position. Severe cardiomegaly is again seen. The mediastinal contours are stable. Aortic knob calcification is again seen. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is worrisome for a small left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. Previously seen right pleural effusion has decreased in the interval with possible trace remaining. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
