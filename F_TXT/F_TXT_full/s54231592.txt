Left chest tube terminates at medial left lung apex. Position of the left chest tube was better evaluated on subsequent chest CT which was available at the time of this dictation. Consolidation of left lung is increased compared to the radiograph prior to the chest tube placement. Diffuse left-sided opacity is suggestive of layering of hemothorax, similar to before. Left pneumothorax is small. Cardiac silhouette is normal size.
