There has been interval advancement of the nasogastric tube, which now has its tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC, unchanged. Bibasilar airspace disease and layering pleural effusions are again seen suggestive of compressive atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
