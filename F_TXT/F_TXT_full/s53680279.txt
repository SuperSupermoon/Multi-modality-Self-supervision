Single portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates increased, more confluent opacification of bilateral lower lobes, compatible with pneumonia. Layering pleural effusions are also seen bilaterally. Heart is normal in size, and cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable. Note is made of a Port-A-Cath with tip terminating in the low SVC.
