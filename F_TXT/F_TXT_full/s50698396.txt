No definite acute process. Somewhat unusual curvilinear opacity projecting along the inferior cardiac border. This is not necessarily a true abnormality, but the possibility of air in the pericardium could be considered. Acquisition of standard PA and lateral radiographs is suggested when clinically appropriate to confirm the probability that this is an artifact.
