Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Underlying trauma board partially obscures the view. The costophrenic angles are fully included on the image. Given this, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No displaced fracture is seen.
