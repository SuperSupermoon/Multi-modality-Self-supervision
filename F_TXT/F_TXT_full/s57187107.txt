Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump is unchanged in position midway between the level of the left main bronchus and aortic apex. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Greater radiodensity in the right lung lateral to the hilus could be asymmetric residual of edema, since pulmonary vascular congestion has improved, or pneumonia due to aspiration. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective positions. No pneumothorax.
