As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The right and left scapular fractures are better displayed than on the previous image. There are known partly displaced bilateral rib fractures. The monitoring and support devices are constant. Constant extent of a millimetric right pneumothorax. No evidence of left pneumothorax, but a small amount of left apical pleural effusion continues to be seen. The strong recommendation for correlation with cross-sectional imaging is again emphasized. Better than on the previous image, there is a circular hyperlucency, projecting over the aortic knob, potentially reflecting an intrafissural or ventral pleural air inclusion. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
