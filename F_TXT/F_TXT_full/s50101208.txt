Compared to earlier postoperative chest radiograph, 12:23. New fluid collection at the apex of the left lung is either loculated hemo thorax or mediastinal bleeding dissecting over the apex of the lung extrapleural E. Left lower lobe consolidation has worsened, presumably atelectasis since there is ipsilateral mediastinal shift. No pneumothorax. Right lung grossly clear. Heart size normal. Cardiopulmonary support devices in standard placements respectively.
