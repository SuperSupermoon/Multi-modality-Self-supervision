Lower lung volumes with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. Mild interstitial edema. Slight increased focal opacity in the right lower lobe/infrahilar region with more indistinctness of the medial right hemidiaphragmatic contours compared to the prior exam - could represent developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting or atelectasis, less likely only from bronchovascular crowding.
