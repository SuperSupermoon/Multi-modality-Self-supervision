Mild pulmonary edema persists. Small to moderate right and small left pleural effusions are slightly larger. Heart size is top- normal. No pneumothorax. Tip of the ET tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, 5 cm above the carina. With the chin elevated this may be acceptable position, given the short length of the trachea. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
