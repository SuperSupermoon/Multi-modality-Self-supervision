CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Rotated lordotic positioning. An ET tube is present, the tip lies approximately 4.0 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip coiled over the left upper abdomen and also overlies the lower left chest. A right IJ sheath is present, tip over proximal SVC. A left subclavian PICC line is present, tip over proximal/mid SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. There is mild prominence of cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is a moderate-sized left effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is a plate-like atelectasis at the right base. The lower right chest wall and costophrenic angle are excluded from the film. There is upper zone redistribution, likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Doubt other evidence of CHF. Compared with ___ at 15:22 p.m., left-sided effusion is larger. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
