The right internal jugular Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position. A left mediastinal drain and catheter are unchanged in position. The patient is status post median sternotomy. A lucency outlining the aortic knob and AP window suggests pneumomediastinum which would be an expected finding in this recently postoperative patient. Heart remains stable in size. The lungs are without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. No definite pneumothorax is seen.
