Compared to the prior film, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is an ET tube, approximately 4.6 cm above the carina; an NG tube, with tip overlying gastric fundus; bilateral chest tubes; a mediastinal drain; and a Swan-Ganz catheter, with tip over the proximal right pulmonary artery. No pneumothorax detected. The patient is status post sternotomy, with prosthetic valve. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for technical differences. Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and mild vascular plethora, without overt CHF.
