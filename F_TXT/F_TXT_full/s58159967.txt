AP chest compared to ___, 8:53 p.m.: Moderate left pleural effusion has increased, and there is more consolidation in the left lower lung, which could be atelectasis but raises concern for either infection or local pulmonary hemorrhage. Previously questioned abnormal bulging mediastinal contour in region of the pulmonary outflow tract, is less pronounced suggesting it was pleural fluid, which has drained elsewhere. No pneumothorax. Tiny right pleural effusion and pulmonary vascular congestion have nearly resolved. Heart size normal.
