Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged in appearance. Multifocal bilateral areas of alveolar consolidation are again demonstrated, with overall similar appearance except for slight worsening in the left lower lobe with associated worsening obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. Bilateral pleural effusions appear unchanged. Findings are concerning for multifocal pneumonia, possibly secondary to an aspiration event.
