A right chest tube is now located lower within the right hemithorax, with its tip projecting over the ascending aorta. There has been interval near resolution of a large right pleural effusion. Prominent opacities in the medial middle and lower right lung may reflect a combination of known hilar mass, pneumonia, or re-expansion edema. Linear atelectasis at the left lung base is new. No pneumothorax. Heart size is unchanged. A right main stem bronchus stent is noted. Prominent gas over the right upper quadrant appears to be intraluminal, likely colonic.
