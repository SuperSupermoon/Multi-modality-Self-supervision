Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiomegaly is stable. There has been interval improvement of the component of pulmonary edema. Still there are remaining opacities in the upper lobes bilaterally, right greater than left, and in the lower lobes, right greater than left. These remaining opacities are a combination of residual pulmonary edema and multifocal pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. There is a small right effusion.
