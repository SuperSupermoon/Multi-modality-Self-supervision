A frontal portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable examination with increased density and irregular contour of the mediastinal and right suprahilar regions correlating with mediastinal mass evident on the ___ chest CT with distal right upper lobe opacification thought to represent post-obstructive pneumonia. There is widening of the distal trachea just above the level of the carina, 2.7 cm compared to 1.5 cm, consistent with placement of reportedly Y-shaped stent. The bronchial components of the stent are not visible radiographically. No other nodule is identified. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion present.
