Single frontal view of the chest. Two pleural drains are in stable position, terminating in the right lung apex. There is now near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax with some mild associated shift of mediastinal structures to the right, suggestive of right lung collapse. These changes appear superimpose all preexisting re-expansion edema and residual consolidation. Small left pleural effusion persists and there is likely a right effusion as well. Widespread pulmonary metastases are redemonstrated.
