Portable AP chest radiograph. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been withdrawn 2 cm, but still should be withdrawn an additional 2 cm. There is otherwise no significant interval change. Again noted is a vascular stent in the left subclavian artery and moderate bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right. Mild interstitial edema has not significantly changed.
