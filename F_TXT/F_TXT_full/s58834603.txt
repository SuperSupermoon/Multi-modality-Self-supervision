A right internal jugular catheter and a right upper extremity PICC terminate in the mid to lower SVC. Thoracolumbar fusion rods and pedicle screws have been placed since the prior chest radiograph. The remaining hardware is unchanged. There is collapse of the left lower lobe with associated volume loss of the left lung. While this could reflect atelectasis, an infectious process cannot be excluded. A moderate left pleural effusion is new and layers posteriorly. Peripheral lung opacities are likely atelectasis and/or pleural fluid and attention on follow up is recommended. The appearance of the mediastinum is unchanged.
