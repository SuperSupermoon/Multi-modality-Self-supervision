Comparison is made to prior study from ___. Endotracheal tube, feeding tube and PICC line are unchanged in position. The tip of the PICC line is in the right atrium. This could be pulled back at least 5 cm for more optimal placement. The heart size is enlarged but stable. There is atelectasis at the right base. There are very low lung volumes with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. There is a left retrocardiac opacity and small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothoraces are seen on either side.
