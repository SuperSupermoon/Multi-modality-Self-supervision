Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of endotracheal tube with tip 6 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube seen coursing into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax identified. Otherwise, unchanged exam with hyperinflation of lungs and severe bullous emphysematous changes identified in the upper lungs, particularly on the left. Increased opacity at the lateral right lung base thought to represent scarring versus infectious process on prior study is better evaluated on current study and appears to be consistent with scarring, unchanged from ___. No pleural effusions evident.
