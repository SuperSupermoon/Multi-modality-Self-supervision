Persistent marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette accompanied by decreased vascular distention and improved interstitial opacities in the right lung that were likely due to edema. However, worsening coalescent opacities are present in the left perihilar region with persistent peripheral septal thickening. It is uncertain whether this represents asymmetrical pulmonary edema or interstitial edema, co-existing with superimposed aspiration or developing pneumonia. Followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
