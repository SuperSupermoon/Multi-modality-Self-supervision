AP chest compared to 12:29 p.m.: Nasogastric tube still loops widely in the hypopharynx, and ends in the distal esophagus. Mild pulmonary edema has developed, moderate cardiomegaly has increased and moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged in position. Lateral aspect right lower chest is excluded from the examination, so assessment of the size of right pleural effusion, is difficult to assess, but it is small and probably increased also. No pneumothorax. A right internal jugular line tip projects over the mid-to-low SVC.
