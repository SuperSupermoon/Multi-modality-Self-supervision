One AP portable semi-upright view of the chest. There are decreased lung volumes. The Dobbhoff tube ends in the stomach, approximately 8 cm from the GE junction. The right PICC line ends in the low SVC. The lungs are clear. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild right atelectasis that is likely exaggerated by low lung volumes.
