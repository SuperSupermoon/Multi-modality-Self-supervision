Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The lungs remain hyperinflated, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Evidence of hiatal hernia is again seen. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may be due to overlying soft tissue, though a small pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen without discrete focal consolidation.
