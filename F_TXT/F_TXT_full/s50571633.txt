AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are lower, reflected in persistent left lower lobe atelectasis, and a smaller region of atelectasis in the right middle lobe or what could be a very small fissural pleural fluid collection. There is no appreciable pleural effusion elsewhere. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly stable. Nasogastric tube coils in non-distended stomach. Very mild narrowing of the trachea above the thoracic inlet could be due to mild post-intubation swelling or an enlarged thyroid gland. Followup advised, depending upon clinical circumstances. No pneumothorax.
