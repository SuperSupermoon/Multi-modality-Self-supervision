AP portable upright view of the chest. A transvenous pacing wire is seen entering the right IJ with its tip in the region of the right ventricle. Multiple overlying EKG leads limit the evaluation. Allowing for this, there are coarsened interstitial markings suggestive of underlying emphysema with possibly a component of mild edema. No large effusions are seen. Bony structures are intact.
