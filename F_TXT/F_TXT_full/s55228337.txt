Moderate cardiomegaly is again re- demonstrated, unchanged. Aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Lung volumes are slightly lower compared to the previous exam, and cause crowding of the bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Linear opacities in the right mid and lower lung fields likely reflect areas of atelectasis or scarring. Partially loculated right pleural effusion is small, and accounting for differences in lung volumes is likely unchanged. Right basilar patchy opacity may reflect atelectasis. Trace left pleural effusion may be minimally improved. No pneumothorax is identified. Marked abnormality of both glenohumeral joints with bony remodeling of the femoral heads is re- demonstrated.
