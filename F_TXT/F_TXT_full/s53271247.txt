Portable AP supine view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior studies. The endotracheal tube ends 3-4-cm above the carina. The upper enteric tube enters the stomach and ends off of the radiograph. Left internal jugular line ends in the mid superior vena cava, and a left subclavian line ends in the lower superior vena cava. Moderate-to-large left and moderate right pleural effusions relatively unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are stable.
