Since the prior study, there is substantial interval progression of multifocal consolidation currently involving the entire lungs. Heart size and mediastinum appear to be unchanged, although the appearance is difficult to interpret given the obscuration of the margins by the multifocal consolidations. No interval increase in pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. In addition to multifocal pneumonia interval development of ARDS is a possibility.
