1. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not definitively identified on this examination. 2. There is a right-sided loculated pleural opacity, which most likely represents loculated fluid and does not appear to be significantly changed. There is volume loss with shift of the mediastinum to the right and aeration of only a portion of the right lung. A more focal oval consolidation in the left upper-to-mid lung is also seen suggestive of pneumonia, but is not significantly changed. More patchy opacity at the left base may reflect other areas of pneumonia or patchy atelectasis. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning.
