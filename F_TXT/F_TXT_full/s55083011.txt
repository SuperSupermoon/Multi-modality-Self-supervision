There is moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly with moderate pulmonary edema, slightly improved compared to yesterday. There is minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles, consistent with small pleural effusions. A right subclavian hemodialysis catheter is at the distal SVC. No pneumothorax. There are no concerning lung consolidations.
