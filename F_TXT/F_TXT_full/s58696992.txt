A portable semi-upright chest radiograph shows a left-sided subclavian central venous catheter with the tip at the level of the distal SVC. Right-sided Cordis tip is at the level of the mid SVC and the tip of the endotracheal tube has been pulled back and is now approximately 3 cm above the carina. Chest tubes and nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. Densely obscured left hemidiaphragm persists and associated mediastinal shift leftward suggests this is related to volume loss from atelectasis rather than pneumonia. Central pulmonary vasculature appears more full than seen on prior a study from 24 hours earlier, but no interstitial edema is suggested.
