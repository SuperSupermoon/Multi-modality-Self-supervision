An endotracheal tube has been placed with the tip terminating below the thoracic inlet, approximately 2 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is in place, which courses below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle compatible with a small right pleural effusion with increased underlying atelectasis of the right lung base compared to the most recent prior study. The left lung is clear. No pneumothorax is detected. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Calcification of the aortic knob is noted.
