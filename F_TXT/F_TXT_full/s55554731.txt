The patient remains intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 5-6 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its distal course not fully imaged. A right internal jugular catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There is a new focal opacity in the left upper lobe with a geometric appearance, probably compatible with atelectasis; a newly forming area of pneumonia is not excluded, however. Dense extensive retrocardiac opacification with air bronchograms and a probable associated pleural effusion persists without clear change. A pleural effusion is not apparent on the right on this study, which may be due to a true decrease or consequence of differences in positioning.
