Single semi-erect frontal view of the chest was obtained. The right lung is clear. Patchy left base opacity most likely represents atelectasis, though underlying aspiration is not entirely excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No pulmonary edema is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The aorta is calcified and tortuous.
