As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is noted. The monitoring and support devices are constant, with the exception of the left PICC line that has been pulled back. The tip of the line now projects over the proximal parts of the clavicle and must be repositioned or replaced. Low lung volumes. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumonia, no pulmonary edema, no pleural effusions.
