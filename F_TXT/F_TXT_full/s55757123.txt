As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a decrease in extent of a pre-existing right pleural effusion. The right lung base is better ventilated than on the previous image. On the left, an area of retrocardiac atelectasis, obviously associated to a small left pleural effusion, persists. No pneumothorax. No new parenchymal opacity. The right internal jugular vein catheter is unchanged.
