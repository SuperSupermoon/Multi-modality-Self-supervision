The apices are excluded from the film. Allowing for this, compared to the prior study, there is new patchy opacity at the left base, though the left hemidiaphragm remains visible. Minimal opacity is seen at the right base, improved. Chain sutures are also noted in this location. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Mild vascular plethora is present. Note made of contrast in the transverse colon.
