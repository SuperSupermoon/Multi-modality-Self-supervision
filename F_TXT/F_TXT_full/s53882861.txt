The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. There has been interval placement of an enteric tube although the tip courses out of the field of view of this exam. A catheter is again seen projecting over the mediastinum, presumably a VP shunt. Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged since the prior study, as is a small left pleural effusion. The right costophrenic angle was not included on this exam. Visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable. Metallic objects projecting over the right shoulder, presumably shrapnel, are unchanged.
