Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Lungs are hyperinflated with mild diffuse bronchiectasis. Diffuse ill-defined nodular opacities within the right upper and mid lung fields as well as in the region of the lingula appear to correspond to tree-in-___ nodular opacities better seen on the prior chest CT. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
