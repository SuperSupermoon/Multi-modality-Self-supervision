Unchanged appearance of the lower postoperative esophagus. The neoesophagus is surrounded by areas of platelike atelectasis. A previously visualized small amount of free intra-abdominal air is no longer visible. Several miniscule air-fluid levels project over the right costophrenic sinus and could be small air inclusions in the soft tissues, at the site of surgical instrument insertion. Mild fluid overload is present. Slightly improved ventilation of the left lung base.
