Compared with prior radiograph, the left-sided PICC line has been partially withdrawn, and the tip of the line has moved from its prior lower SVC position to the midline likely at the level of the left brachiocephalic vein. A nasojejunal tube is seen with the tip to the left of midline, following a contour compatible with placement in the fourth portion of the duodenum versus the proximal jejunum. A line tracking across the left upper quadrant which may represent a drainage catheter. Otherwise, the lungs are well expanded and clear noting right linear opacity suggesting atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
