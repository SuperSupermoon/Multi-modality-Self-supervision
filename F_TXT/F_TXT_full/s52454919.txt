The ETT is in standard placement. The enteric tube traverses the diaphragm into the left upper quadrant and its tip is not seen. The right internal jugular venous catheter ends in the mid to low SVC, unchanged. Lung volumes remain low lung, overall similar to the prior exam. Day to day changes in bilateral interstitial opacities are most compatible with edema, slightly worse from the prior exam. Atelectasis at the left lung base is overall unchanged. The heart normal in size, but slightly increased. The mediastinum is not widened. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
