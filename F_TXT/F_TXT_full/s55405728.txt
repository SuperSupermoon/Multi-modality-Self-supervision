Right-sided chest tube is in place with the tip in the right upper hemithorax. However, there is a large pneumothorax with significant collapse of the underlying right lung. The patient has chronic leftward mediastinal shift secondary to volume loss from left upper lobectomy, however, there appears to be slightly increased leftward shift on the current examination as compared to the preoperative, raising concern for tension. Subcutaneous emphysema is seen along the right chest wall. There is increased opacity within the left lung base, likely secondary to layering pleural effusion and some atelectasis. Median sternotomy wires are intact.
