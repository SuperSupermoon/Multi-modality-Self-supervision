As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an extensive opacity in the right lower lung, likely caused by a combination of diaphragmatic elevation, parenchymal collapse, and pleural effusion. These changes could be caused by a soft tissue mass at the level of the right hilus, given that the entire right mediastinum is considerably enlarged. The patient is of the bronchoscopy. The radiograph shows no evidence of pneumothorax. The left heart border and the left hemi thorax appear normal.
