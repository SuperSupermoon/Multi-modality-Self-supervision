A left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG with an aortic CoreValve device again noted. Fractures of several median sternotomy wires are re- demonstrated. The heart remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contour is similar. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy opacity in the left lung base could reflect an area of atelectasis though infection or aspiration is not excluded. No pneumothorax is identified.
