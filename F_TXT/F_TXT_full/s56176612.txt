The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above the carina. There is a right internal central jugular venous catheter terminating in the superior vena cava. The heart is probably normal in size, allowing for technique. The aortic arch is partly calcified. The lungs are essentially clear, perhaps with minimal left basilar atelectasis. Opacification of the left costophrenic sulcus makes a very small pleural effusion difficult to exclude, although doubted. There is no pneumothorax.
