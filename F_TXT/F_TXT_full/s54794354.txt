AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. New pair of longitudinal rods (___ type) are now present along the spine, the highest reaching the area of the mid portion of the thoracic spine. The patient is again intubated with the ETT terminating in the trachea 4 cm above the level of the carina. Previously present left-sided chest tube is again seen and is in unchanged position. There is clearly evidence of right-sided pleural effusion blunting the right-sided lateral pleural sinus and extending upwards along the right-sided lateral chest wall. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature again appears congested. The heart size is increased in this patient with evidence of previous sternotomy and status post bypass surgery. Possibility of fluid overload exists similar as it did on the previous examination. There is no evidence of new discrete local pneumonic infiltrates.
