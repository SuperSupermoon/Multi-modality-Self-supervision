The lung volumes are reduced. The heart size is mildly enlarged with dense mitral annular calcifications noted. Aortic knob is calcified. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no pulmonary edema is demonstrated. The hilar contours are unremarkable. Peripheral patchy opacities are noted projecting over the right upper and mid lung fields which are unchanged and may be attributable to a chronic interstitial abnormality. Patchy opacities within the left mid and lower lung fields may reflect areas of atelectasis or infection. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is chronic and compatible with pleural thickening. No pleural effusion is otherwise seen. No pneumothorax is identified. Remote left-sided rib fractures are seen.
