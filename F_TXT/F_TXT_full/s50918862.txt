There are diffuse bilateral dense alveolar opacities. Evaluation of the lung bases is limited by overlying soft tissue and low lung volumes. Heart size appears enlarged, possibly in part exaggerated by AP technique and low lung volumes. Compared to prior exam, the mediastinum appears widened. No pneumothorax is detected on this view. Small bilateral pleural effusions may be present although evaluation is difficult due to overlying soft tissue.
