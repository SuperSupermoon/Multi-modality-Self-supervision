The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is persistent mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. There are probably small bilateral pleural effusions. Minimal vague opacity projects over the right upper lung, similar to the prior appearance, although more generalized opacification was present on the prior examination. Compared to earlier radiographs, this area of opacity is similar and so may be a more chronic process. Lines, tubes and drains have been removed.
