In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric tube has been pushed forward to the mid to lower portion of the stomach, where it coils back on itself so that the tip is in the upper stomach pointing to the esophagogastric junction. Endotracheal tube remains in good position. There is increasing engorgement of indistinct pulmonary vessels consistent with developing pulmonary edema. The hemidiaphragms are not well seen, suggesting small bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases. In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
