The patient is status post open reduction internal fixation of the left humeral head. The study is not tailored to assess the fixation. Low bilateral lung volumes with patchy airspace opacities bilaterally, predominantly involving the right lung and may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema. Unchanged left apical pleural parenchymal thickening. No pneumothorax identified. The size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but may be secondary to low lung volumes.
