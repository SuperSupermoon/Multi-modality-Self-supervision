As on the prior outside study there is near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax with mediastinal shift to the left did trachea is deviated to the left and the endotracheal tube tip is seen at the thoracic inlet with the carina not adequately visualized and NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach. Right-sided PICC line tip is in the expected location of the cavoatrial junction the right lung has a hazy appearance with ill-defined vasculature. Some of this could be due to overlying soft tissues but pulmonary edema is likely also present. There is probably right pleural effusion.
