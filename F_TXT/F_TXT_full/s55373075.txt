Interval placement of a nasogastric tube with its tip projecting over the stomach and the side port just below the gastroesophageal junction. The left subclavian PICC line is unchanged position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with a left ventricular prominence. Lungs appear relatively well inflated with no focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. No large effusions; the left costophrenic angle is not entirely included on the study
