Compared to the prior chest x-ray, there is increase in perihilar edema suggesting worsening failure, though florid pulmonary edema is not present. Right effusion is again noted. The heart remains markedly enlarged. The hemidiaphragm is obscured, probably due to a left effusion, but associated left atelectasis may also be present.
