As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. In particular, there is no evidence for a pneumothorax after left chest tube placement (an apparent decrease in lung transparency over the heart border and left lung bases is obviously caused by an object exterior to the patient). The position of the endotracheal tube and the left internal jugular vein catheter are constant.
