Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Lung volumes are slightly low. Increased perihilar opacities may be accentuated by the technique but the indistinctness of the more distal pulmonary vessels is suggestive of mild edema. Retrocardiac opacitiesmay likely represent a combination of edema and atelectasis however superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Bones and the upper abdomen are grossly unremarkable.
