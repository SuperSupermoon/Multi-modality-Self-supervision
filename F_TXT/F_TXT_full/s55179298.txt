Slightly rotated positioning. The tip of the tracheostomy tube lies approximately 2.8 cm above the carina. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, possibly with a small left effusion. Opacity in the right upper zone medially is more pronounced on the current examination. There due to appear to be associated air bronchograms. Opacity at the right base appears improved, with improved visualization of the right hemidiaphragm. A small right effusion remains present. Again seen is the right sided Port-A-Cath, with tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction. The left IJ central line is again seen, with tip over mid/distal SVC. Although it is difficult to confirm the patient's position, there is suggestion of left convex rotary scoliosis of the lumbar spine. It remains possible, albeit less likely, that this is an artifact due to positioning. Rounded iatrogenic structure over the left lower abdomen is compatible with a gastrostomy tube.
