PA and lateral chest compared to ___ at 10:24 p.m.: ET tube, intra-aortic balloon pump, in standard placements, right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium, and upper enteric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. There is substantially greater left perihilar consolidation today than on ___. Although mediastinal veins are wider, lung vasculature is not dilated, so this cannot be simply ascribed to asymmetric edema. This could be developing pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. There is some distortion of the left mid ribs laterally due to rib fractures, but I cannot be sure that none of them is acute. Dr. ___ was paged.
