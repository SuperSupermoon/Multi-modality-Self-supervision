Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube with tip projecting 3.5 cm above the carina. An enteric tube traverses below the diaphragm inferiorly out of view. Low lung volumes are unchanged. The heart size is top normal, with minimal unfolding in the thoracic aorta and arch calcifications. The lungs are clear with the exception of trace subsegmental atelectasis in the left base. Previously seen periaortic lucency one day prior persists, which remains concerning for pneumomediastinum and/or pneumopericardium. There is no pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or large right effusion.
