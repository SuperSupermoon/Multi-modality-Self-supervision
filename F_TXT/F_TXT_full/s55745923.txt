Compared to the prior study the left effusion has dramatically increased in size and there is only a small amount of visualized aerated left lung with remainder of the lung obscured by volume loss/infiltrate/ effusion. On the right there is hazy alveolar infiltrate and low lung volumes. The Swan-Ganz catheter is been removed. There is a right IJ Cordis with tip in the superior vena cava. The ET tube tip is unchanged. The enteric tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach. .
