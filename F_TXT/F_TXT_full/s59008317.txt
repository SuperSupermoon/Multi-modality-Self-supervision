As compared to the previous image, the patient has received the new nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach. There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. The left subclavian line is unchanged. There is a newly appeared platelike atelectasis at the right lung bases.
