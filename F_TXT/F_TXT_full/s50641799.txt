Overall, there has been no substantial interval change from the previous exam. There is re- demonstration of the right lower lung mass containing a fiducial marker with asymmetric increased interstitial opacities noted in the right lung compared to the left, again suggestive of lymphangitic spread of tumor and/or asymmetric pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities are also seen within the right upper lobe concerning for pneumonia, as demonstrated on the recent CT. Hyperinflation of the left lung is again noted with a small left pleural effusion, unchanged. No pneumothorax is identified. Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position. Cardiomediastinal contours are similar with persistent rightward shift of mediastinal structures.
