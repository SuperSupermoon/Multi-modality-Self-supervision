The patient is status post median sternotomy. A left-sided pacemaker device is noted with single lead terminating in the right ventricle. Massive enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is again demonstrated with marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, unchanged. There is mild pulmonary edema, new from the prior exam. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified, though the extreme right apex is not well assessed due to obscuration by the patient's chin. The mediastinal contours are unchanged. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
