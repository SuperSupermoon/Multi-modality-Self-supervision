Left chest tube terminates over the left mid lung. There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Ill-defined opacity in the left lower lung likely reflects atelectasis. Left chest wall emphysema reflect chest tube insertion. No residual pneumothorax is clearly seen. Comminuted mid left clavicular fracture and multiple rib fractures are better seen on concurrent CT.
