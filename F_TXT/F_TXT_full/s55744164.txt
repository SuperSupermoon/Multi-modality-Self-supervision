In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The engorgement of pulmonary vessels is less prominent, though there still may be some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Minimal atelectatic changes are seen at the bases. There is an area of asymmetric opacification at the right base medially. This could merely reflect prominent vascular markings. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of superimposed consolidation could be considered.
