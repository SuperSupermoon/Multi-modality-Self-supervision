Since the prior chest radiograph performed 1 hr earlier, there has been interval placement of a right subclavian line which terminates just below the expected level of the cavoatrial junction. Enteric tube terminates in the body of the stomach. Right lung base opacity is similar. Slight interval improvement and left lung base opacity, suggesting atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
