As compared to the previous radiograph, lung volumes have slightly increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. An atelectasis seen on the previous image, located at the right lung base, is no longer visible. The atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung region is constant in appearance. Moderate cardiomegaly persists in unchanged manner.
