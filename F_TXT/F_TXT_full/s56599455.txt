1. Tracheostomy tube, feeding tube, and left subclavian central line are unchanged in position. 2. Interval appearance of a right basilar opacity with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. This finding most likely reflects partial lobar collapse, although an acute infectious process or aspiration should also be considered. Streaky opacities in the retrocardiac region also likely reflect areas of atelectasis, though superimposed infection cannot be entirely excluded. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning between studies.
