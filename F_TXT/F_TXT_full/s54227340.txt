AP chest compared to ___:16 p.m.: Lung volumes have improved at both lung bases, particularly the right, a good indication that previous findings were not due to pneumonia. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has also improved. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Fractured sternal wires, probably explained by chronically non-fused sternum after median sternotomy.
