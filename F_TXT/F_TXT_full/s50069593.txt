A new left basilar chest tube is demonstrated with interval decrease in size of the left pleural effusion, now moderate in extent. There is a persistent layering pleural effusion on the right which is moderate in size. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis though infection cannot be excluded. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. No definite pneumothorax is present. Nasogastric tube tip terminates at the distal esophagus, and should be advanced for optimal positioning.
