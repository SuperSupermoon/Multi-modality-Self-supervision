In comparison with the study of ___, there is more prominent hazy opacification in the left hemithorax consistent with layering fluid or blood in the left hemithorax. The right lung is essentially clear. There is apparent displacement of mediastinal contents to the right. However, much of this could reflect merely obliquity of the patient rather than true mediastinal shift. Evidence of several left rib fractures. No convincing evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with some basilar atelectasis. The apparent fractures of the distal clavicle and scapula are not as well seen on this study.
