Endotracheal tube ends at the carina and should be withdrawn 3-4 cm for standard positioning. Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size, which has nevertheless increased since the earlier examination suggesting intravascular volume administration but raising the possibility of cardiac injury or hemopericardium. Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung could be due to aspiration. Followup advised. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Nasogastric tube ends in the proximal duodenum.
