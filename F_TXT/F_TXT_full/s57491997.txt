In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. There is some increasing indistinctness of mildly engorged pulmonary vessels, raising the possibility of developing increased pulmonary venous pressure. The opacification at the right base medially persists. Again this could merely reflect crowding of vessels with atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Somewhat ill-defined opacification in the retrocardiac region raises the possibility of volume loss or even possible consolidation in the retrocardiac region.
