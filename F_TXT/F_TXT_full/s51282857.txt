Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There is a left-sided PICC, terminating at the distal SVC. There are moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions, which appears increased on the left, although this could relate to differences in patient position. Perihilar opacities are again seen consistent with pulmonary edema which may be slightly improved in the interval. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. Mediastinal contours are stable.
