Small left pneumothorax is stable. Left pleural effusion has decreased. Underlying left lung masslike consolidations are probably unchanged. Left basal pigtail catheter remains in place. Linear opacities in the right mid lung are again noted, represent areas of bronchiectasis and scarring in the right upper lobe, better seen on prior CT. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated.
