AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained on ___. On the preceding examination, the reduction of the right-sided lower densities were indicative of successful right-sided thoracocentesis in comparison with a chest examination of ___. The left-sided base did not show any significant interval change. No evidence of apical pneumothorax was found on either side. Position of left-sided PICC line was unremarkable. On the present portable chest examination, pulmonary vascular congestive pattern has increased again. There is now an increasing haze on the right base suggestive of some increased pleural effusion probably layering in the posterior pleural compartments as the patient is in semi-erect position only. On the left base, increasing diaphragmatic contour haze exists and most likely the patient developed again bilateral pleural effusions. A lateral view could better answer the question if significant pleural effusion exists requiring renewed thoracocentesis. No pneumothorax is identified on the present examination.
