Consolidation in the right lower Lung most pronounced on ___ has been improving subsequently, probably clearing pneumonia. Left lower lobe is still largely airless, but whether this is atelectasis alone or in combination with pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate. Upper lungs are clear. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable. ET tube and nasogastric tube in standard placements respectively. No pneumothorax.
