Single frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval left chest tube removal with no evidence of pneumothorax. Additionally, there has been interval extubation and as a consequence, reduced lung volumes accentuating the cardiac silhouette and causing crowding of the vasculature. The right internal jugular catheter is unchanged. No focal consolidation is identified.
