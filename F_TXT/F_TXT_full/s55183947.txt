As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Normal lung volumes. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, but no evidence of overt pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. Slight deviation of the trachea to the left and increased upper mediastinal density to the right may suggest the presence of a thyroid nodule with extensive effect. No pneumothorax.
