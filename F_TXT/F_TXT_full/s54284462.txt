In comparison with the study of ___, there is a right IJ catheter in place with its tip in the mid portion of the SVC. Continued low lung volumes with some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour. There is some increased opacification at the right base medially. This could reflect some crowding of mildly engorged pulmonary vessels suggesting elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Other possibilities would be postoperative atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
