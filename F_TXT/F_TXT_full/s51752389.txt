As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal increase in a pre-existing small left pleural effusion, with subsequent left retrocardiac atelectasis. In returned, the pre-existing opacity at the bases of the right lower lobe has improved and is smaller and less severe than before. Otherwise the radiograph is unchanged.
