Diffuse hazy opacification of bilateral lung fields is associated with moderate cardiomegaly suggesting moderate pulmonary interstitial edema. Interstitial lung disease can also have this appearance. More confluent right lung base airspace opacification may represent a superimposed infectious process or atelectasis, depending on the clinical setting. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
