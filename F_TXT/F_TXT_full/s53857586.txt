CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with film obtained at ___ at 10:47 a.m., the PICC line has been repositioned and now overlies the mid/distal SVC, near the site of the unchanged left IJ line. No pneumothorax is detected. There is evidence for COPD, with attenuation of vessels and presumed bullous change in both upper zones and possible atelectasis/scarring at the bases. In addition, there are hazy and patchy opacities at both bases and increased retrocardiac density. However, the appearance is unchanged compared with the film obtained earlier the same day. The appearance is also relatively similar, though slightly improved at left base, compared with the film from ___ at 11:08 p.m. No gross effusion.
