1. Two left-sided chest tubes and a left subclavian PICC line remain in place. The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG and mitral valve replacement. Stable overall enlarged cardiac and mediastinal contours. There continues to be patchy opacity at the left base likely reflecting a compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be entirely excluded. There is a lucency overlying the left lower lateral chest wall consistent with subcutaneous emphysema. Left lateral pleural thickening is again noted. No pneumothorax. Overall,aeration in the left lung has improved suggesting resolving edema.
