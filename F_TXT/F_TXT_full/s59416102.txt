Large multiloculated right pleural effusion with known associated pleural thickening has minimally increased since the recent radiograph, and is associated with substantial atelectasis of the right lung with or without coexisting consolidation. Mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy have been more fully detailed on recent CT. Left lung is grossly clear except for a new linear atelectasis at the base peripherally.
