1. Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter has its tip at the pulmonary trunk. Left internal jugular introducer catheter with tip in the proximal SVC. Left subclavian central line with its tip in the superior vena cava. Endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 0.5 cm above the carina, unchanged. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right upper quadrant and left upper quadrant surgical drains remain in place. 2. Right basilar opacity most likely reflects a moderate-sized pleural effusion with some associated compressive atelectasis. Left lung is clear without evidence of a pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
