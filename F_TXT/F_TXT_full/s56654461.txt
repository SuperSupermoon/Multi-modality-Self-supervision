Single portable view of the chest. When compared to prior, there is new right basilar opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm likely due to at least some component of pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascular congestion appears grossly similar compared to prior. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is not definitely enlarged since prior noting slight limitation from rotation to the right. Lower thoracic and upper lumbar dextroscoliosis are noted. Old healed posterior left rib fracture again noted.
