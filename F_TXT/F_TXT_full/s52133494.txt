Left subclavian line tip is at the level of proximal right atrium. Heart size and mediastinum are overall unchanged but there is new atelectasis in the right upper lobe and slight improvement of lower lobe atelectasis. There is mild vascular congestion. No definitive new focus of infection is seen but some of those areas that are presumably atelectasis might represent focus of infection. Continued attention on the subsequent radiographs is required.
