Lung volumes remain low. Bilateral pleural effusions on the prior exam appear to have essentially resolved. Mild indistinctness of the left costophrenic angle could suggest some residual small effusion. Left lower lung atelectasis has markedly improved. Mild cardiomegaly, even in the presence of low lung volumes and this AP view is likely still present. Aortic knob calcifications are unchanged. No focal consolidation to suggest a focal pneumonia. No pneumothorax. No edema. The descending thoracic aorta slightly tortuous, unchanged. Dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracic spine is moderate, unchanged. Surgical clips projecting over the right upper abdomen are consistent with cholecystectomy.
