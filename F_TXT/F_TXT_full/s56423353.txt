At least a small left pleural effusion remains following thoracentesis. There is no pneumothorax. Large scale opacification in the left lower chest is either residual loculated effusion or left lower lobe consolidation or collapse. Depending upon the profile of the pleural fluid, CT scanning would be helpful in determining whether there is malignancy or infection in the left hemi thorax. Right lung is grossly clear. Heart is not enlarged. Mild dilatation of the azygos vein reflects elevated central venous pressure or volume.
