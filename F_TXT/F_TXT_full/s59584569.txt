New interstitial lines in the right mid and lower lung probably due to edema. Small right pleural effusion increased, persistent moderate left pleural effusion unchanged. The triangular opacity at the periphery of the left lung looks to be a pneumatocele, communicating with the pericardium . Following insertion of a new pericardial drainage catheter the ___ of the cardiac silhouette decreased substantially. Pneumothorax shown by the recent chest CTA is not apparent on this conventional radiograph.
