Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 6 cm above the level of the carina. A large bore right-sided central venous catheter is seen, terminating at the cavoatrial junction/right atrium. Nasogastric tube is seen, coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not included. There are low lung volumes. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and a right subpulmonic effusion is not excluded. There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature which may be due to congestion or accentuated by low lung volumes. The left lung is otherwise clear. The cardiac silhouette is top normal.
