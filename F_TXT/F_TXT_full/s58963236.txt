Comparison is made to the prior study performed a day earlier. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There are persistent low lung volumes. Moderate pulmonary edema has minimally increased. Bibasilar opacities, larger on the right side, are a combination of atelectasis and a small effusion. ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction. NG tube tip is out of view, below the diaphragm.
