Tracheostomy tube is in place. Lung volumes remain low. The left lower lung is essentially airless and probably collapsed. Retrocardiac opacity persists and appears worse from prior exam, suggesting atelectasis or aspiration appropriate clinical setting. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggest atelectasis and/or small effusion. Platelike opacity in the right lower lung is probably atelectasis and slightly worse. The heart is severely enlarged, slightly worse compared to the prior exam. No frank pulmonary edema. The aortic valve is calcified, unchanged.
