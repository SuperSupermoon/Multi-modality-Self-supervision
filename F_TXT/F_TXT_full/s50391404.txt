As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach. The lung volumes remain low and a pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis is slightly more extensive than on the previous image. Minimally increasing diameters of pulmonary vessels might reflect pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions.
