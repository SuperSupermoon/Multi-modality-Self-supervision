Single frontal view of the chest shows overall little change from prior. Again seen is mild pulmonary edema and stable cardiomegaly. Small bilateral pleural effusions with resultant atelectasis are unchanged. Again visualized is a stable retrocardiac opacity. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or new consolidations.
