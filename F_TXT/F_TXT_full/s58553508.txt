The tip of the endotracheal tube is 9.1 cm above the carina. This could be advanced 2-3 cm for more optimal placement. The previously seen enteric tube has been removed. There is some increased density along the left retrocardiac area medially which is new since the prior study. This may represent developing atelectasis. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. There are no pneumothoraces.
