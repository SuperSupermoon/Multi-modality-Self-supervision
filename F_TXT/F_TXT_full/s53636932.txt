In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the mid body of the stomach, then coils back on itself so that the tip lies in the fundus just beneath the left hemidiaphragm. There has been the development of increased opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm and obliteration of the costophrenic angle. This is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion.
