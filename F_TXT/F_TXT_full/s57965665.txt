An endotracheal tube is present with tip 4.9 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is also present with tip in the proximal stomach but sideholes likely above the gastroesophageal junction. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Bilateral increased interstitial markings are concerning for moderate pulmonary edema. Additional hazy opacity in the right apex may be due to aspiration or infection.
