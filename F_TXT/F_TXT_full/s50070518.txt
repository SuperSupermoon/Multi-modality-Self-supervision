AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest imaging: Right subclavian line heads up into the neck and out of view, anatomic localization impossible on this single frontal projection. There is no evidence of mediastinal or intrathoracic bleeding associated with this line placement, nor pneumothorax. Lungs are extremely low in volume, with relatively mild bibasilar atelectasis. Heart size top normal. No pulmonary edema.
