Tubes and lines are unchanged in position. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Increasing retrocardiac consolidation in the setting of a layering effusion likely reflecting compressive lower lobe atelectasis. Pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Interval development of patchy opacity at the right lung base favoring atelectasis. No obvious pneumothorax.
