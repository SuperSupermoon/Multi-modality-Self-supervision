AP chest compared to examination earlier today, with different medical record number, therefore unavailable, performed at 1:45 p.m. and discussed with Dr. ___ by telephone at 4:30 p.m.: Endotracheal tube is still at the carina and needs to be withdrawn 3-4 cm. Dr. ___ was paged. Mild pulmonary edema is stable. Right pleural tube coursing obliquely through the right hemithorax is unchanged in position, a new right basal pleural pigtail catheter is new and previous right pneumothorax is substantially resolved. There is a small amount of pleural effusion bilaterally. Mediastinum is essentially normal superiorly, but the cardiac portion is widened and may reflect an increase in the volume of the small hemopericardium seen on the torso CT performed earlier today.
