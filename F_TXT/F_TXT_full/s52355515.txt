As compared to the previous radiograph, the small effusion has not substantially changed. In the interval, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. As a consequence, the lung volumes have decreased, with increasing density of the vascular and bronchial structures. Right chest tube is in situ. No pneumothorax.
