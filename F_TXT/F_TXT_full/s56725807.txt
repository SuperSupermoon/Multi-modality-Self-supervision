Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump terminates about 7 mm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob, and a Swan-Ganz catheter terminates within the descending left pulmonary artery. These findings have been communicated by telephone to Dr. ___ at 9 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable. The rapid improvement of the left perihilar opacity favors pulmonary edema. Residual asymmetrically distributed perihilar opacities may reflect asymmetrical edema, although superimposed process such as pneumonia in the right lung is also possible. Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is unchanged, but a small left pleural effusion has decreased.
