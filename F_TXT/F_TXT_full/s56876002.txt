Yesterday's pulmonary edema has improved. Persistent consolidation left lower lobe could be combination of atelectasis and edema though pneumonia is not excluded. Moderate cardiomegaly also improved. Azygos fissure simulates mediastinal widening. Pleural effusions small if any. No pneumothorax. Right PIC line ends in the upper SVC. ET tube and esophageal drainage tubes in standard placements respectively.
