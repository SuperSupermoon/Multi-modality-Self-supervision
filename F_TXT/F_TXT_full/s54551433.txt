Compared to the study from the prior day, there is no significant interval change. There continues to be volume loss in the lower lobes with retrocardiac opacity and some focal areas of obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. It is unclear if this is due to volume loss or early infiltrate. The heart continues to be moderately enlarged with mild pulmonary vascular redistribution. The right IJ line with tip in the distal SVC is again visualized.
