Bilateral multifocal pulmonary opacities primarily in the bases, left greater than right with obscuring of the left hemidiaphragm border. Small left pleural effusion with left retrocardiac consolidation also seen. Distention of the azygos vein raises the possibility of volume overload and pulmonary edema superimposed on known infection. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Dobhoff tube tip in the stomach. ET tube 3.7 cm above the carina.
