AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 8:20 a.m.: Small left pleural effusion is larger, left pneumothorax is minimal, if any. No right pleural abnormality. Multiple fractures of posterolateral left middle ribs are substantially displaced, perhaps more so now than on the earlier examination, putting the patient at risk for lung trauma and bleeding. New midline catheter is presumably an epidural infusion device, but the tip is not visible. Bibasilar atelectasis is relatively mild. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
