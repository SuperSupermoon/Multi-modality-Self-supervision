Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. There are increasing bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis ,although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. Prominent pulmonary arteries raising the possibility of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. There are small layering effusions. The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning. No overt pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Multiple calcified nodes within the neck unchanged.
