The Dobhoff tube projects in the left upper quadrant in the region of the stomach. Lung volumes are slightly lower, however no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax detected. A small faint opacity projecting over the right upper lung is new since the radiograph from the prior day. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
