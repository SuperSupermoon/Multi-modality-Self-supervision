Heart size is mildly enlarged, slightly increased from the prior study accounting for differences in technique. The aorta is mildly tortuous. Right hilar enlargement appears new compared to the previous exam. Mild pulmonary edema is present. Hazy opacification within the right mid and lower lung is new in the interval. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. Clips are seen projecting over the left breast.
