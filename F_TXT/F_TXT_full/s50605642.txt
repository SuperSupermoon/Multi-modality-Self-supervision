The lungs are clear without focal airspace opacity or consolidation to suggest aspiration or pneumonia. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The trachea is midline. A healed fracture of the mid to distal right clavicle is again noted.
