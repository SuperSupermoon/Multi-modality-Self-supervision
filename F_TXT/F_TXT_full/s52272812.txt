Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained. A persistent left apical pneumothorax is slightly increased in size without evidence of tension. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is present as well as a small left pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable. Multiple minimally displaced left rib fractures are unchanged.
