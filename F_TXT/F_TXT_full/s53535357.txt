Right subclavian PICC line and right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter unchanged in position. There has been no interval change in the diffuse bilateral parenchymal process which could represent severe pulmonary edema, although pulmonary hemorrhage or a diffuse infectious process could have a similar appearance. Clinical correlation is recommended. There is likely a small layering left effusion. Given the diffuse airspace process, assessment of cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult. No obvious pneumothorax.
