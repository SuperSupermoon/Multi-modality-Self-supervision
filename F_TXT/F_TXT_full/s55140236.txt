As compared to ___ radiograph, cardiomegaly and diffusely tortuous and likely dilated thoracic aorta appears unchanged. New heterogeneous opacities have developed in the right mid and both lower lungs and may reflect multifocal atelectasis, with or without coexisting aspiration or developing infection. Small right pleural effusion is new. Smoothly marginated left pleural or extrapleural opacity is grossly unchanged since ___ and may reflect an extrapleural lipoma or fibrous lesion of the pleura. Standard PA and lateral chest radiographs prior to discharge would be helpful to allow more accurate comparison to the prior study.
