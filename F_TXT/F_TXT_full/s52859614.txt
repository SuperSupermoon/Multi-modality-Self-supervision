Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Streaky atelectasis is noted in the lung bases without focal consolidation. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle could suggest the presence of a trace left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is identified however the medial aspects of the lung apices is obscured by the patient's neck and chin projecting over this region. Clips are seen projecting over the right lateral chest wall. Dextroscoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is present with associated degenerative changes.
