A left-sided pigtail catheter terminates just below the level of the aortic knob. The endotracheal tube is covered by the enteric tube and its tip cannot be assessed. Remaining lines and monitoring devices are in unchanged position. As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been significant improvement of the left-sided pleural effusion with a small amount of pleural fluid still remaining. Increased opacity at right lung base may represent atelectasis or overlying vascular structures. There is no definite pneumothorax.
