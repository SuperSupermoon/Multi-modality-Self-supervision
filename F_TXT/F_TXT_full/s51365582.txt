Low lung volumes are present which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. No pulmonary edema is demonstrated. Patchy opacity in the left lung base likely reflects a small pleural effusion and possibly atelectasis in the adjacent lung, though infection is difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax is seen. Cervical spinal fusion hardware is noted.
