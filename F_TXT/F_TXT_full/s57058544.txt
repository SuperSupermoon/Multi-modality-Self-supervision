A bedside AP radiograph of the chest once again demonstrates marked cardiomegaly as well as a moderate right and small left pleural effusion. The left cardiac border and left hemidiaphragmatic contour remain obscured, likely by a combination of atelectasis and effusion, although pneumonia cannot be excluded depending on the clinical setting. There is stable widening of mediastinum, consistent with elevated central venous pressure. An endotracheal tube terminates no less than 1.5 cm above the carina with the patient's neck significantly flexed. An OG tube courses into the stomach and out of field of view and a right PICC terminates within the right atrium, and could be pulled back 1.5 cm to ensure seatment in the lower one-third of the SVC.
