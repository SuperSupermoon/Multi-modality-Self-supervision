As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have substantially decreased. There is a new left-sided pleural effusion, combined to a basal and retrocardiac opacity. Although the opacity could be atelectatic in origin, coexisting pneumonia cannot be excluded. Moderate cardiomegaly. No overt pulmonary edema. The right central venous access line is in correct position.
