1. There continues to be bilateral diffuse interstitial and airspace disease with worsening consolidation in the right upper lobe, right hilar region and left lower lobe which is concerning for worsening pulmonary edema, although a superimposed infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. There is likely layering left effusion. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax. Previously described vague opacities in left upper lobe are not well appreciated on the current study.
