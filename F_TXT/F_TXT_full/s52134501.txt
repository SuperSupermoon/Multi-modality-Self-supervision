Portable supine radiograph is presented for review, which limits assessment of small pneumothoraces. Lungs are low in volume with dense retrocardiac opacity, which may represent extensive left lower lobar collapse versus consolidation accompanied by moderate pleural effusion. Pacemaker and epicardial pacer are difficult to assess. Cardiomegaly is unchanged.
