Comparison is made with prior studies, most recent one performed seven hours earlier. Differentiation between large bullae in the left upper lobe from pneumothorax is very difficult. There is no evidence of a large pneumothorax. There appears to be still a small left pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube is in a standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with cardiomegaly. There are low lung volumes. There is a small unchanged left pleural effusion. The bibasilar atelectasis have increased. Left PICC tip is in the lower SVC. Bibasilar bronchial wall thickening is unchanged. There are no new lung opacities.
