In comparison with the study of ___, there is been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the upper stomach. The side-port is not well seen, though is probably at the level of the GE junction. The tube should be pushed forward at least 5 cm for better position. Little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs except for some suggested silhouetting of the outer aspect of the left hemidiaphragm, raising the possibility of some atelectatic changes and possible small effusion.
