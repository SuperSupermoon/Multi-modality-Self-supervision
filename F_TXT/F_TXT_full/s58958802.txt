A single portable frontal view of the chest was performed. The lung volumes are low which results in vascular crowding without overt evidence for pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unchanged from the recent CT. A distended and air-filled stomach is noted.
