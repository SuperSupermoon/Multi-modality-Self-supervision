As compared to the previous radiograph, the retrocardiac parenchymal opacity still clearly visible. There are no signs indicative of fluid overload but the lung parenchyma in the left perihilar areas and at the right and left lung bases continues to be slightly too dense. This could reflect an infectious change, as suggested in the previous report. The lung volumes have slightly increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressures. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
