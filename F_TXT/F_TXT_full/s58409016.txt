In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size. There is indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, though less prominent than on the previous study. No definite focal pneumonia, though there is some asymmetry at the bases with opacification laterally on the left that should be followed on subsequent radiographs. The lingular nodule is better seen on the prior CT examination. Some right pleural plaquing is again noted.
