The lung volumes are low. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is moderate to severely enlarged. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, without overt pulmonary edema. Evaluation of lung bases is limited due to the presence of low lung volumes, but there is likely mild bibasilar atelectasis. It is difficult to exclude the presence of trace bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified.
