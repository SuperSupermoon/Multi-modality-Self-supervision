As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral pleural effusions are distributed in a slightly different manner. Their overall extent appears to be similar and rather extensive. As a consequence, there are bilateral basal areas of atelectasis. The size of the cardiac silhouette appears to have slightly decreased, the heart is now at the upper range of normal. No new parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. Unchanged position and course of the left pectoral pacemaker.
