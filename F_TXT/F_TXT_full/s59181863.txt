1. There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube which lies approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular central line and dual-lead left-sided pacer are unchanged in position. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stably enlarged status post median sternotomy for CABG. The stomach is distended with air. There are layering bilateral effusions, and there is increased bilateral airspace and interstitial opacities likely reflecting worsening pulmonary edema. Bibasilar patchy opacities may be related to the pulmonary edema but also could represent patchy atelectasis in the setting of effusions. The elliptical opacity in the right mid lung persists and likely represents fluid loculated within the horizontal fissure. No pneumothorax is seen.
