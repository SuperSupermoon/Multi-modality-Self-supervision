Postoperative subcutaneous emphysema in the left anterior and lateral chest wall extends up the axilla to the neck. I do not believe there is appreciable pneumothorax, left apical pleural tube crosses the left chest obliquely. A uniform opacity also marginated obliquely in the left upper hemithorax is probably loculated pleural fluid or blood. Left lower lobe is mildly atelectatic. Right lung is low in volume but well aerated. Heart size is normal. Dr. ___ was paged at 2:15, 1 minute after the findings were recognized, and again at 2:25pm and 4:45pm.
