There has been interval removal of a left PICC. A single frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. Hazy opacification of the mid-to-lower lungs is partially attributable to overlying soft tissues. Retrocardiac dense opacification is not significantly changed compared to the prior study and is likely attributable to atelectasis, although infection or effusion at the left lung base cannot be excluded. There is no right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. The heart size is somewhat difficult to assess, although appears mildly enlarged, unchanged. The mediastinal contours are normal.
