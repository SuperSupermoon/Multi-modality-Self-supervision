There is a new ET tube 5.4 cm above the carina. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution that is worsened in the interval with alveolar infiltrates bilaterally and dense retrocardiac opacity that could be due to volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. The heart size is moderately enlarged. NG tube tip is in the stomach. There is a small right effusion.
