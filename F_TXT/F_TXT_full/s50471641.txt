AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Interpretation of the current pulmonary abnormality is difficult in the absence of prior films. There is clearly a small amount of pleural effusion bilaterally, mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion. Beyond that the findings are of uncertain chronicity and specificity. Distortion of upper lobe vasculature suggest emphysema. Heavy interstitial abnormality at the lung bases could be dependent edema, pulmonary fibrosis, even aspiration or pneumonia, an indeterminate combination. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer defibrillator noted. No pneumothorax.
