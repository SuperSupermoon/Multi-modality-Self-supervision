Study is somewhat limited as the lung bases have been excluded from the study. The tracheostomy, left-sided PICC line, and right-sided pacemaker and wires are unchanged position. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. There are bilateral pleural effusions and a left retrocardiac opacity which appear stable from the prior study. There are no pneumothoraces.
