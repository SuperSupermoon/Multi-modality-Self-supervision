3 airway stents are in place. One cannulates the trachea, from the level of the sternal notch 4 cm inferiorly terminating approximately 2 cm above the carina. The second in the left main bronchus starting at the carina, also between 3 and 4 cm long, terminates before the origin of the left upper lobe bronchus. The third approximately 3 cm long, in the right bronchial tree, probably bronchus intermedius, although its relationship to the margins of the upper and middle lobe bronchi cannot be determined from this conventional chest radiograph. There is no pneumothorax pleural effusion or mediastinal widening. The heart is mildly enlarged. The device projecting over the lower midline could be a probe, but it is unfamiliar to me. Lungs are grossly clear.
