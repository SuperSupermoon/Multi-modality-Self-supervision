As compared to the previous radiograph, there are unchanged low lung volumes. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without overt pulmonary edema but with signs of mild fluid overload. An atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions is unchanged. The pre-existing opacity at the right lung base is no longer visible. A relatively wide right upper mediastinum is likely to be caused by mild patient rotation. No pneumothorax, no pleural effusions.
