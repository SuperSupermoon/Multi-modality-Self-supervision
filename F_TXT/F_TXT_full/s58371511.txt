There continues to be severe cardiomegaly and low lung volumes. Aeration in the right is improved, but there continues to be areas of volume loss/infiltrate in both lower lungs. Overall, the fluid status is slightly improved compared to the study from the prior day. An underlying infectious infiltrate, particularly in the lower lobes cannot be excluded.
