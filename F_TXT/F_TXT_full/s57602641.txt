The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 7.5 cm above the carina. For more optimal positioning could be advanced by 3 to 4 cm. An orogastric tube was also placed, which terminates in the gastric cardia but with little purchase. The tube could probably be advanced by about 8 to 10 cm if gastric positioning is desired. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a patchy bronchovascular type of opacification pattern in the right infrahilar region. Possibilities include airway inflammation, infection or possibly aspiration.
