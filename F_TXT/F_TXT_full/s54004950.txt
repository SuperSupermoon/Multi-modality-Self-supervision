A small right apical pneumothorax is slightly smaller than yesterday. The previously seen small amount of opacification over the right mid lung is improved, with only a residual opacity persisting. No focal consolidation. There is bibasilar atelectasis. No pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
