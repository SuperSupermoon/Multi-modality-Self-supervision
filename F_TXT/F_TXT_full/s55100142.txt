AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. Evaluation is limited given patient rotation to the right, as well as low lung volumes. There is a markedly abnormal mediastinal contour with significant widening. Given the suboptimal technique and patient rotation, this may result in slight distortion of the mediastinal silouhette. This widening may reflect aortic tortuosity and ectasia, though appears new from prior. There are subtle ground glass opacities in the lungs, which could reflect pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion is seen. No pneumothorax. Heart size cannot be assessed. Bony structures appear intact.
