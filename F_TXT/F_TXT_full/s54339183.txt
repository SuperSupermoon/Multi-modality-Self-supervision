There is a large left-sided pleural effusion obscuring the left heart border. There is a lucency which projects over the density, which could be suggestive of a loculated effusion, however another source of air cannot be excluded. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. No focal consolidations concerning for infection are otherwise seen. The lungs bilaterally demonstrate nodular densities, likely secondary to granulomas. The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable. There is slight contralateral deviation of the carina.
