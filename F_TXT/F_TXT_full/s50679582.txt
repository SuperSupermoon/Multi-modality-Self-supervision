AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance. Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of low SVC. Extensive interstitial opacities are bilateral, unchanged as well as bilateral pleural effusions. Interstitial prominence and loculation of the pleura on the right as well as pulmonary nodularity is better appreciated on the CT of the chest. Overall, no substantial change since prior examination has been demonstrated. The only change could be potential increase in the intrafissural component of pleural effusion on the right.
