A left pneumothorax, suggested by the deep sulcus sign on recent chest radiograph, is not convincingly shown on this AP upright projection. Endotracheal tube remains at the level of the clavicular heads. Right sided internal jugular catheter tip terminates in the low SVC. Bibasilar atelectasis and small right effusion are unchanged. Posterior spinal fusion rods are new.
