An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.3 cm above the carina. Diffuse hazy opacity over the right hemithorax with associated blunting of the right costophrenic angle is likely secondary to a small to moderate-sized pleural effusion. Retrocardiac and left lung base opacity persists, likely secondary to atelectasis and pleural fluid. There is no pneumothorax.
