AP chest compared to ___: Multifocal ground-glass opacification of both lungs, seen both on conventional chest radiograph and CTA, ___, has not subsequently changed. The nodular peribronchial infiltration in the anterior and lingular segments of the left upper lobe are more easily recognized today, suggesting there may have been some improvement in the opacification of the lung otherwise in that region. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is the same or improved. Right PIC line ends low in the SVC. Filamentous opacity crosses the left chest obliquely to the apex, but I do not recognize it. Despite serious image degradation in the CT scan by continued breathing, the diagnosis of peribronchovascular tumor infiltration is quite reasonable. The alveolitis could be drug reaction, viral pneumonia, or pulmonary hemorrhage. If none of those diagnoses is tenable, then idiopathic condition such as acute eosinophilic pneumonia can be entertained, although it looks there may be improvement over the past 24 hours. Dr. ___ was paged.
