Lung volumes are relatively lower than the prior study. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion. The small right-sided pneumothorax seen on preceding chest CT, earlier today, is not appreciated on this radiograph. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Multiple right-sided rib fractures were better assessed on preceding CT.
