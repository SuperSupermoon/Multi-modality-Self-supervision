AP chest compared to ___: New ET tube in standard placement. Upper enteric drainage tube passes into a non-distended stomach and out of view. No central venous line noted. Right caval venous filter, unchanged in appearance recently. Multifocal pulmonary consolidation has improved slightly, still quite severe. Some of the change could be due to the effects of positive pressure ventilation or diuresis. Suggestion of cavitation in some regions of consolidation suggests staphylococcus infection as an alternative to viral pneumonia. In addition, the two can coexist.
