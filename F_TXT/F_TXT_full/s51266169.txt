AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 7:38 a.m.: Very large chronic and recently growing multiloculated left pleural effusion has been partially evacuated, but substantial pleural abnormality persists, probably unrecoverable without surgical exploration. Pulmonary vascular congestion in the right lung is stable. Air collection at the base of the left hemithorax is a result of failure of the chronically collapsed left lower lung to reexpand. Heart is very large and grossly unchanged.
