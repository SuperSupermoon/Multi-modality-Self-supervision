With the chin in flexion, the endotracheal tube is less than 2 cm from the carina and care should be taken to not advance it any further. A left subclavian line is again seen at the thoracic inlet and a left IJ catheter is in the mid SVC. An enteric tube is seen with its tip extending below the level of the diaphragm. The left lower lobe remains consolidated and the leftward mediastinal shift is slightly more pronounced indicating greater component of atelectasis responsible for the persistent small to moderate left pleural effusion. The heart is moderately enlarged. There is no appreciable pleural fluid on the right and no pneumothorax.
