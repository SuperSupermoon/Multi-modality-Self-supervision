AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. There is status post sternotomy, apparently related to previous bypass surgery. Moderate cardiac enlargement is noted. The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern and diffuse haze over the bases is consistent with interstitial edema. The previously described superimposed patchy and partially confluenting parenchymal infiltrates have regressed slightly, but persist to some degree bilaterally. The right-sided diaphragm can now be identified again, so that major pleural effusion is unlikely. If evaluation of pleural effusion is essential, one should consider the performance of a lateral view as well.
