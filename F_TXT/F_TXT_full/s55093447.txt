As compared to the previous radiograph, the left-sided PICC line is in unchanged position, with the tip located at the level of the cavoatrial junction. The patient has received a nasogastric tube. The tube can be followed down to the lower third of the esophagus, but is not visible in a more peripheral location. An abdominal radiograph would be helpful to ensure correct tube position. The lung volumes are unchanged. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. Atelectasis at the right lung base. No pleural effusions.
