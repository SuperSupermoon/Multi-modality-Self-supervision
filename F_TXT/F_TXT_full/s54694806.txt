Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion is seen. Bibasilar opacifications consistent with bilateral effusions and compressive atelectasis is seen. No consolidation is seen but may be obscured by the bibasilar effusions. Left subclavian central venous line is at the junction of the SVC with the tip still pointing towards the lateral wall. ET tube and gastric tube are unchanged and in appropriate position.
