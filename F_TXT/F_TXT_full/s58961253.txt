In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung volumes. The layering effusion at the right base is not seen, though this may merely represent a more upright position of the patient with and elevated right hemidiaphragmatic contour. The increased opacification in the right mid to upper lung zone is less prominent, suggesting that this could have been a manifestation of pulmonary vascular congestion. Multiple nodules on the left again are consistent with metastatic disease. Otherwise little change.
