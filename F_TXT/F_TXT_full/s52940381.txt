A semi-upright frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends 6.6 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube ends at the gastroesophageal junction with the side port in the distal esophagus and could be advanced. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Pulmonary vasculature is slightly indistinct suggesting increased pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. Heart size is top normal. The aorta is tortuous. A left chest wall pacemaker leads project over the expected locations in the right atrium and right ventricle.
