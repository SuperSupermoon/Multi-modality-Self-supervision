Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. A left-sided chest catheter is seen extending into the lateral left upper hemithorax. As compared to the prior study, there has been significant reexpansion of the left lung with a trace residual left apical pneumothorax remaining. There is minimal elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and left base atelectasis. Right lung is clear.
