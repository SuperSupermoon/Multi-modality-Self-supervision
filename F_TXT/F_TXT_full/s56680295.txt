The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is a similar background interstitial abnormality. The previously noted opacity at the left lung base has cleared although there is mild residual more medial retrocardiac opacity, probably not new. The latter may be due to residual scarring or atelectasis. More clearly likely to represent active pneumonia, however, is a new vague opacity including nodular elements within the right upper lobe with some mild increase in background volume loss. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
