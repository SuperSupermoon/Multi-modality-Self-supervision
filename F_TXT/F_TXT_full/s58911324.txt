Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina. The NG tube and Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. Slight interval improvement in the left lower lobe consolidation is demonstrated. The pulmonary edema previously demonstrated appears to be unchanged, moderate. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Underlying infectious process is possible potentially partially obscured by pulmonary edema.
