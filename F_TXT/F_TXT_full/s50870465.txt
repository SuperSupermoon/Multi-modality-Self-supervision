Right chest tube remains in place, with a persistent small apical pneumothorax. The basilar component described previously is no longer evident, but a small lateral component is still evident. Multifocal opacities in the right mid and lower lung show interval partial clearing and likely represent resolving contusion in the setting of right-sided rib fractures. However, dense opacity in right retrocardiac region has slightly worsened and may reflect coexisting atelectasis or aspiration. Otherwise, no relevant short interval change since recent radiograph.
