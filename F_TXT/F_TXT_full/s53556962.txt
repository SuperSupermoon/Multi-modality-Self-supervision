The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are unremarkable. The lungs are mildly hyperexpanded, consistent with COPD. No definite consolidation is identified. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Again noted is a retrocardiac opacity, not changed since prior examination, which may represent a hiatal hernia.
