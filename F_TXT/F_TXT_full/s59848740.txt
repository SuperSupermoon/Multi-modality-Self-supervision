AP chest compared to ___ through ___: There has been very little change in the appearance of the lungs in this patient with severe pulmonary fibrosis over the course of this hospitalization, probably a function of either concurrent pneumonia or acceleration of pulmonary fibrosis.

PIC line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction alongside a right internal jugular line. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. No pneumothorax.
