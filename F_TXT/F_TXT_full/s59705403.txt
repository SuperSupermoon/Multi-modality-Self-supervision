AP chest compared to ___ through ___. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Pulmonary vascular congestion and mediastinal venous engorgement are somewhat more pronounced today than before, reflected in part by lower lung volumes, but I do not see pulmonary edema and pleural effusion if any is minimal. Greater opacification in the base of the right lung is most readily explained by atelectasis, but in order to exclude pneumonia, I would strongly recommend repeat conventional chest radiographs, at full inspiration, utilizing oblique views if necessary to get a second look at the lung bases, particularly the right.
