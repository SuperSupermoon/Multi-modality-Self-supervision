Since the prior radiograph performed yesterday afternoon, there has been interval placement of a left-sided pigtail catheter. This has resulted in overall improvement in the left pleural effusion, though a small effusion persists. A moderately sized layering pleural effusion is also noted on the right. No pneumothorax. Other support lines interfaces are stable in position. The Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the right pulmonary artery. Enteric tube is seen in the stomach. Left internal jugular introducer terminates in the low SVC. Median sternotomy wires are intact.
