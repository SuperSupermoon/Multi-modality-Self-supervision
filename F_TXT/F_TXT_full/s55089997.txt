Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 7.8 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip is within the lower SVC. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy opacities within the lung bases appear more pronounced in the interval, and may reflect worsening atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
