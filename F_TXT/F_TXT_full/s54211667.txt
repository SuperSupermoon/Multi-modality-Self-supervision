Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Aortic knob is calcified, and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Perihilar haziness with vascular indistinctness and mild interstitial pulmonary edema appears slightly improved compared to the prior study. Trace bilateral pleural effusions are present, without interval change in size. No pneumothorax is detected. Old rib fractures are again noted.
