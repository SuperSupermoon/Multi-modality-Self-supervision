In comparison with the study of ___, the cardio mediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There are lower lung volumes. Indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with developing pulmonary edema. The left hemidiaphragm has been obscured, consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. The remainder of the study is essentially unchanged.
