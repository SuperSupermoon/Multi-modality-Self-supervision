Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.7 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, and inferior aspect not well seen. There is moderate pulmonary edema. Left base opacity is seen, which may be due to overlying soft tissue, although underlying consolidation or atelectasis may be present. Trace bilateral pleural effusions are difficult to exclude. Prominence of the superior mediastinum may be due to supine technique and AP position as well as low lung volumes, although if clinical concern for acute aortic injury, consider chest CTA. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. No displaced fracture identified.
