In the interim, the patient has been extubated, and an enteric tube removed. Lung volumes remain low. There has been mild improvement in left lower lobe atelectasis. Dense retrocardiac opacity persists and may reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia. Bilateral perihilar parenchymal opacities are little changed and reflect mild pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The heart size has decreased in the interim, though the azygos remains markedly distended. There is marked gaseous distention of the stomach.
