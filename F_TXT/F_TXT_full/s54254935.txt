As compared to the previous radiograph, previous right PICC line has been removed and replaced by a left PICC line. The tip of the line projects over the mid SVC. There is an endotracheal tube. As on the previous radiograph, there is massive cardiomegaly as well as moderate to severe pulmonary edema, associated with areas of bilateral, right predominant pleural thickening as well as extensive areas of atelectasis at the right and the left lung bases. That could be a calcified pleural plaque at the level of the right lung bases. As documented on the previous radiographs, dating back to ___, these changes are longstanding. To rule out an acute component, however, a short-term repeat radiograph after dehydration is recommended.
