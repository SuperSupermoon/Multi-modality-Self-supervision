Right-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right atrium. Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is improved compared to the previous study. Moderate size left and small right bilateral pleural effusions also appear somewhat improved. Opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of compressive atelectasis. Infection in the left lung base is not excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Remote left mid clavicular fracture is again noted.
