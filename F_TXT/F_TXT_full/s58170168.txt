An endotracheal tube terminates just above the level of the carina, therefore, proximal reposition by 1.5 cm is recommended. The tip of a nasoenteric catheter is at the same level as the endotracheal tube, findings concerning for a coiled tube in the nasopharynx. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. A left approach AICD/pacemaker has leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged from prior. There is no pneumothorax. There is probable bibasilar atelectasis and mild vascular congestion. No overt interstitial edema is identified. There is no large pleural effusion.
