The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 3 cm above the carina. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is a recurrent collection of air projecting along the lower mediastinum bilaterally. There are moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the right than left with patchy opacities in the medial lower lung suggesting atelectasis. Other etiologies such as pneumonia and aspiration cannot be excluded, however. Contrast from barium study projects over the left mid abdomen. In addition, the right upper quadrant shows some air in a geographic distribution suggesting residual pneumoperitoneum but potentially increased. Pneumomediastinum also persists.
