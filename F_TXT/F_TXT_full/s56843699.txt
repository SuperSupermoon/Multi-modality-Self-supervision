In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes. Tip of the endotracheal tube now measures approximately only 2 cm from the carina. Right central catheter remains in place. Dobbhoff and nasogastric tubes extend into the stomach. There again is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications that are more prominent than on the previous study. Poor definition of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and some compressive atelectasis at the bases. Again, the radiographic appearance could be consistent with severe pulmonary edema. Widespread pneumonia, or ARDS.
