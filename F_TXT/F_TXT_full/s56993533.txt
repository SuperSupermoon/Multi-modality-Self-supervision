The heart is normal in size. The aortic arch is calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is a nodular focus projecting over the right lower lung, probably a nipple shadow, although not visualized on prior radiographs. Otherwise the lung fields appear clear.
