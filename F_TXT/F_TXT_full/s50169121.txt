Right trans subclavian pacer leads follow their expected courses from the right pectoral generator. No pneumothorax, mediastinal widening, or pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. There is no mediastinal venous engorgement to suggest elevated central venous pressure, and no pulmonary edema. Mild upper lobe pulmonary vascular distention is of uncertain chronicity and probably exaggerated by semi supine positioning.
