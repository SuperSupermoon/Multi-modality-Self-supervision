Heterogeneous opacification of both lungs, sparing only the left midlung, has worsened, probably a combination of pulmonary edema and disseminated infection. Moderate right pleural effusion is slightly smaller. The asymmetric thickening of the left apical pleural margin, due to peripheral consolidation and the adjacent cavitation are unchanged. Heart is normal size. ET tube and right jugular line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube passes to the low stomach. No pneumothorax.
