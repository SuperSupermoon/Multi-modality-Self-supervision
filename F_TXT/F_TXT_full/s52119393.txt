Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates slight interval improvement in aeration of the right lung. There is continued near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax, secondary to large pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. There is a small area of persistently aerated lung in the left upper thorax. As before there is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion with some adjacent atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Note is made of a chronic right anterior shoulder dislocation, which is unchanged.
