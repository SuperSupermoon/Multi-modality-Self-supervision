1. Interval placement of nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm and the tip is not identified. Interval intubation with the tip of the endotracheal tube approximately 4 cm above the carina. Interval placement of a right internal jugular central line which has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning. Persistent bibasilar airspace opacities, left greater than right. In addition, there are now some more patchy nodular opacities in the right mid-to-lower lung and in the left mid-to-lower lung. These findings could reflect areas of patchy atelectasis but raise the possibility of a multifocal pneumonia and/or septic emboli. Clinical correlation is advised. Small left effusion persists. No pneumothorax is seen.
