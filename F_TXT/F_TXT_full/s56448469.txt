Left pectoral pacer with two trans-subclavian leads is unchanged. There are sternotomy wires and thoracolumbar fusion hardware, incompletely assessed. The upper lungs remain well aerated, with slight decrease in pulmonary edema. The opacities at the bases again reflect the presence of effusions. There is no opacity to suggest pneumonia.
