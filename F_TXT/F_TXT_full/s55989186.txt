Unchanged left basilar chest tube. There is again seen increased opacity of the left mid to lower lung fields, which likely represents a combination of pleural fluid, consolidation, and atelectasis. The right lung is clear. There are no pneumothoraces. There is some subcutaneous emphysema in the left lower chest wall at the entry site of the chest tube. There is some widening of the right AC interval and tapering of the lateral aspect of the clavicle, ___ due to old trauma or surgery.
