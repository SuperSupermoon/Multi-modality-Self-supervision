A chest tube again projects over the right hemithorax with trace subcutaneous emphysema along its external course. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is persistent patchy retrocardiac opacity with air bronchograms which has improved somewhat. There is a persistent small right apical pneumothorax. The distance between the superior margin of the lung and the outer chest wall is about 15 mm, which is slightly increased.
