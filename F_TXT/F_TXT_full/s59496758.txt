1. Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip at the cavoatrial junction. Endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is now seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tube coiled within a non-distended stomach.

Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
