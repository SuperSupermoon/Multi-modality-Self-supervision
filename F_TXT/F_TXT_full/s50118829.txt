AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are lower following tracheal extubation. Interval widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette could also be due to lower lung volumes, but I suspect an increase in intravascular volume or pressure as well and possible accumulation of mediastinal fluid. Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are new. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. A tiny volume of pneumomediastinum marginates the aortic knob. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC.
