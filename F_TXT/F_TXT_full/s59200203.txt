AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The Swan-Ganz catheter tip terminates at the level of the right main pulmonary artery or potentially already after right pulmonary artery bifurcation. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. Bibasal opacities are noted, with no substantial change as compared to ___. Upper and mid lung zones are clear. The vasculature is distinct, thus most likely no pulmonary edema is involved in those bibasal consolidations: infection?, aspiration? No pneumothorax is seen.
