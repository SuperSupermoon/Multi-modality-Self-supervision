AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day earlier. There is interval decrease in left pleural effusion after thoracocentesis and currently the effusion is small and partially loculated. There is no substantial pneumothorax. Heart size is enlarged, unchanged. Right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC. No pulmonary edema is seen. The left retrocardiac opacity might reflect atelectasis, but infectious process cannot be excluded. Pigtail catheter is in place.
