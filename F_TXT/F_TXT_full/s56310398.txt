Lungs are hyperinflated and there is parenchymal distortion, especially at both lung apices, consistent with known underlying emphysema. No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. No pneumothorax. Right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. Interval placement of a nasogastric tube with the tip projecting over the stomach but the side port is near the gastroesophageal junction. Advancement by 5-6 cm may be prudent. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
