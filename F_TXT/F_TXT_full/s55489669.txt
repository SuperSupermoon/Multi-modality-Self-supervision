Since the prior radiograph, there are new loculations of the moderate left pleural effusion, overlying the left upper lobe. The right upper lobe consolidation has slightly improved, although pneumonia can cavitate and produce a similar appearance. A moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged, with persistent pulmonary edema. Unchanged tracheostomy tube in standard position and left PICC line in the upper right atrium.
