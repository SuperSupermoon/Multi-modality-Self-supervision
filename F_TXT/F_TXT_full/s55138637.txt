The endotracheal tube ends 3 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube follows the expected course, although the tip is not seen. The right internal jugular catheter ends in the low SVC. Bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely representing a combination of small effusions and pulmonary edema, are unchanged over multiple prior studies. No pneumothorax.
