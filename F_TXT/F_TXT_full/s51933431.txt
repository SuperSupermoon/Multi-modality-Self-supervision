Massive scoliosis with rotation of the patient to the right. Subsequent decrease in volume of the right hemithorax with presence of linear opacities at the right lung base. Change in position of the patient favors atelectasis over pneumonia. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a minimal left pleural effusion. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
