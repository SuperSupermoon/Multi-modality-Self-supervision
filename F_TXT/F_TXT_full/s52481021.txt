The tip of the balloon pump overlies the inferior edge of the aortic arch, slightly high. A right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is present, tip over proximal right pulmonary artery. Heart size is unchanged. The vascular congestion and moderate pulmonary edema appears slightly worse in comparison to the prior exam. There is probable trace fluid at the right cardiophrenic angle. The extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film. No gross effusion is seen on either side.
