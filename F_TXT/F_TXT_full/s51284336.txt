Multiple EKG leads overlie the right lower chest. Allowing for this, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Also again seen is patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region which could represent either focal atelectasis or a pneumonic infiltrate. The appearance is not significantly changed compared with ___ or ___. Subsegmental atelectasis left lung base has increased. Minimal blunting the right costophrenic angle is unchanged. The left costophrenic sulcus is clear.
