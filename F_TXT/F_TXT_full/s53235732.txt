AP chest compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___: Since moderate cardiomegaly has worsened, it is possible that increased caliber to the upper mediastinum, particularly to the right, could be due to venous engorgement. There is no way that I can exclude a small mediastinal hematoma, but it would be reasonable to follow this with conventional radiographs rather than jump to a chest CT scan. There is no pneumothorax. Atelectasis, due in part to large hiatus hernia, is slightly more pronounced today than before. There is no pleural effusion.
