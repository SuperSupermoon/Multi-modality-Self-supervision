Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal superior vena cava. There is a feeding tube coursing below the stomach with the tip not identified. Lung volumes remain low, and there is pulmonary vascular congestion likely reflecting a fluid replete state. Linear opacity at the left base may represent an area of subsegmental atelectasis. The left costophrenic angle is not entirely included on the study. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning and technique between studies.
