A tracheostomy is in standard position. Right internal jugular catheter and right subclavian catheters end in the SVC, unchanged. Two nasoenteric tube course to the stomach with the tips out of view. Two catheters project over the right hemithorax, unchanged. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. There is no change from ___ in moderate right pleural effusion and atelectasis, probably with fluid in the fissure. Edema on the left has improved. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No substantial pneumothorax.
