The newly placed right IJ terminates in the region of the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax. There is perhaps mild improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion since the prior exam. Otherwise, the frontal radiographic appearance of the thorax is overall similar to the radiograph exam performed earlier on the same day. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion. Stable appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila. Stable bilateral lower lung volumes.
