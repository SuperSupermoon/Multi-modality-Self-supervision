A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained. Low lung volumes accentuate cardiomegaly and prominence of the hilar vasculature and interstitium. Nonetheless, pulmonary vascular congestion has increased. Bibasilar atelectasis and a small left effusion are also present. No new focal consolidation, or pneumothorax is present. A left-sided subclavian catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. A nasoenteric tube extends inferiorly out of the field of view.
