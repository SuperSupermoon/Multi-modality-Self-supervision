ET tube is in standard placement. Right internal jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial and a nasogastric tube passes into a nondistended stomach and out of view. Right basal pleural drain unchanged in position. Small right pleural effusion may be present, but there is no pneumothorax or left pleural effusion. Substantial consolidation persists in the right lower lobe particularly medially. The lobe may be collapsed. Hila are persistently enlarged, but improved since earlier in the day, presumably due to decreased pulmonary vascular resistance or left heart pressure. Nodular lung lesions seen on chest radiographs and CT scanning ___ have dramatically improved, presumably a combination of clearing infection and asymmetrically distributed edema.
