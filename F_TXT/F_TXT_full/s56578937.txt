The lungs appear clear. There has been interval resolution of prior right basilar opacity. No confluent opacity is identified. There is mild prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature, though no overt interstitial edema. No large pleural effusion is evident. There is no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
