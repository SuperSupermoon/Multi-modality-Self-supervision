Mild cardiomegaly is present, with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta noted. There is diffuse calcification of the thoracic aorta. There is perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted, with bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting atelectasis though infection or aspiration is difficult to exclude. There is no pneumothorax. Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is noted.
