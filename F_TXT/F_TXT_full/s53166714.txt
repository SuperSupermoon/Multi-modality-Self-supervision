Endotracheal tube has been repositioned, with tip now terminating 5.5 cm above the carina. Other indwelling devices remain in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Slight improvement in left retrocardiac atelectasis and adjacent small left pleural effusion, but a small left apical pneumothorax has slightly decreased in size, and there is no evidence of right pneumothorax. Small right pleural effusion and adjacent right basilar atelectasis are unchanged.
