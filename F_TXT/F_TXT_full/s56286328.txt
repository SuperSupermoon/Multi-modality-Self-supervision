In comparison with the earlier study this date, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the mid to lower body of the stomach. An endotracheal tube is now in place with its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, now with evidence of mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Bilateral atelectatic changes are seen, especially in the retrocardiac region on the left. The costophrenic angles are not sharply seen, suggesting some bilateral pleural effusion.
