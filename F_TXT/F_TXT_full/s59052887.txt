A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left internal jugular catheter which terminates at the origin of the SVC. There is increasing opacity of the left hemi thorax with minimal aeration of the left upper lobe and leftward shift of the mediastinum, compatible with increasing left lung collapse. No right focal consolidation or pleural effusion is appreciated. No pneumothorax is visualized.
