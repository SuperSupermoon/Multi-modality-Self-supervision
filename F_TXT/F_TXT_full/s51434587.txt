Right pleural catheter is similar in appearance and left pleural catheter has apparently changed position. Small right apical pneumothorax has slightly increased in the interval. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by diffuse interstitial edema. Bibasilar atelectasis has improved on the right and slightly worsened on the left. No other relevant change.
