Compared to the prior radiograph on ___, the lungs appear better aerated. The tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position. Right apical opacification along with a calcified granuloma is unchanged since ___, which is the earliest chest imaging available to us. There are also bibasilar opacities which are not significantly changed from the prior exam, and are likely due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Stable mild cardiomegaly. There is a moderate amount of free air under the right hemidiaphragm which has slightly improved since the prior radiograph. The feeding tube is out of view on this CXR.
