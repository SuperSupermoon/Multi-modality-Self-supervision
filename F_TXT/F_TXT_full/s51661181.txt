As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been interval removal of a left chest tube. A right internal jugular venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. An endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina. A feeding tube projects over the gastric fundus, tip is not included in this examination. There is miniscule, if any, left apical pneumothorax. A left mid lung opacity is likely a chest tube artifact from continuing suction. Increased densities along the periphery of the left mid lung are probably bone fragments from rib fractures and are stable. Right lung is clear. There are no pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
