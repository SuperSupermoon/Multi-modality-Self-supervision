A right IJ central venous catheter is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the mid SVC. A Dobbhoff feeding tube is in appropriate and stable position. There is interval increased opacification of the bilateral lung fields, likely reflecting increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions. There is increased fluid extending along the left lateral lung base. No pneumothorax is detected. Bibasilar consolidation most likely reflects atelectasis. Prominence of the aortic knob is unchanged corresponding to aneurysmal dilation of the thoracic aorta. There is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated in the setting of bibasilar consolidations.
