Overall, when compared to the prior study, there is no interval change in appearance of the lungs with persistent low lung volumes and parenchymal distortion with scarring and post-surgical changes noted in the right upper lung. Focal airspace opacity seen at the left base may reflect a combination of pleural fluid and known fibrotic changes. Bullous change at the right apex is stable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the parenchymal abnormalities. No pneumothorax.
