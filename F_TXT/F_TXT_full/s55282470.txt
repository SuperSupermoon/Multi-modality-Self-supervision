Low lung volumes are again noted. Superimposed on atelectasis and bronchovascular crowding are diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities throughout the lungs which given differences in technique have not significantly changed since yesterday's exam. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities.
