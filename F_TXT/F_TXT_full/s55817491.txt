AP chest compared to ___, 9:04 p.m.: Large left pleural effusion has increased slightly, while evidence of mild biventricular decompensation is now restricted to the right heart. Small right pleural effusion stable. No pneumothorax. Left lung largely atelectatic except for the apex where vasculature is congested. Left pleural effusion is presumed to be hemothorax, alternatively empyema. Subsequent chest radiograph showing pleural drainage, performed at 5:24 a.m. is available at the time of this review.
