A large left pleural effusion, largely obliterating the left heart border, persists. There is evidence of underlying atelectasis or consolidation as before. There is continued evidence of a small right pleural effusion. Lung volumes are lower than before and there is more streaky density at the right base consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. The patient is status post TAVR. The aorta is calcified. Allowing for technical differences in the studies, mediastinal structures are stable. A transvenous pacemaker remains in place. There are no concerning bone findings.
