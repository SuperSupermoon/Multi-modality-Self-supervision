Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 6 cm above the level of the carina. The patient is in better position as compared to prior study and the mediastinum no longer appears shifted. There are low lung volumes. Left base opacity may relate to effusion and atelectasis, though underlying consolidation may be from aspiration and/or infection may be present. There is also right basilar opacity which could also relate to aspiration and/or infection depending on the clinical context. The mediastinum is widened. If there is concern for mediastinal injury, chest CTA should be considered. Pulmonary edema persists. d/w Dr. ___ at 11:30pm ___.
