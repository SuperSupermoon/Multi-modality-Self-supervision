The lung volumes are low. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Calcified valvular annulus. Densities of calcific nature are seen at both hilar regions, right more than left and likely reflect calcified lymph nodes. There is minimal increase in density in the lung apices, right more than left, with peribronchial and linear appearance, suggesting the presence of a fibrotic upper lobe change, potentially caused by exposure to granulomatous disease. This could be consistent with the calcified right hilar lymph nodes. No acute changes. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusions.
