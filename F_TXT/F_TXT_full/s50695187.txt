Evaluation somewhat limited by patient rotation. Endotracheal tube 5 cm above the carina. Left internal jugular approach central venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC just distal to the brachiocephalic confluence. Fluid layering in the right minor fissure with some adjacent patchy opacity likely reflecting atelectasis. Lungs otherwise clear. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
