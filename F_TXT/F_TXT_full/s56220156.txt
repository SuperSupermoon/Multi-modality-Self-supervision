Comparison is made with prior study ___. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Large bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged allowing the difference in position of the patient, the patient is very rotated. Bibasilar atelectases, larger on the left, are stable. Right PICC tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Evaluation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is limited due to the rotation of the patient. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
