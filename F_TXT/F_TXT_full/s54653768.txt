The patient has been intubated. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina. A right internal central jugular venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava. A feeding tube projects over the left upper quadrant, partly imaged. There is again leftward rotation of cardiomediastinal structures. The aortic arch is partly calcified. The heart borders are indistinct but there is a left ventricular configuration. Left basilar opacification and potentially a pleural effusion persist. Bilateral right mid lung opacities with a fairly peripheral distribution have worsened and raise concern for pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.
