The enteric tube extends to at least the body of the stomach, with its distal tip not captured on the current study. Right PICC terminates near the low SVC. Endotracheal tube tip lies 4.7 cm above the carina. Extensive multifocal pneumonia is unchanged. When interpreted in conjunction with the prior CTA performed on ___, there are additional background groundglass opacities, which are not entirely explained by an infectious process. A drug reaction could be considered. There may be a small pleural effusion on the left. No pneumothorax. Heart size is top-normal.
