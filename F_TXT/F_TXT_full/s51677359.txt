1. Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. There are stable cardiac and mediastinal contours in this post-operative patient. Diffuse bilateral interstitial abnormality which is unchanged and is of uncertain clinical significance. Linear opacity at the right base has increased and likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis rather than post-inflammatory scarring. There is also increasing opacity in the retrocardiac region which may represent patchy atelectasis, although a developing pneumonia should also be considered. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
