As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slightly improved aeration in the upper lung regions. Otherwise, the rather diffuse parenchymal opacities, with a slight lower lobe predominance, and air bronchograms, is not substantially changed. There is mild retrocardiac atelectasis but no pleural effusions are seen. The findings are again suggestive of pulmonary edema, most likely based on capillary permeability. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
