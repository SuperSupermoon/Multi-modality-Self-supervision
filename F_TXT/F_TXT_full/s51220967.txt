As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are in unchanged position. Unchanged left subclavian vein catheter. The lung volumes remain low but a small left pleural effusion and the right basilar atelectasis have newly appeared. Also new is a small retrocardiac atelectasis. No pneumonia, no overt pulmonary edema. On the current image, but signs of mild fluid overload remain present.
