Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged, as seen on the previous study. The mediastinal contour is grossly unremarkable. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is demonstrated without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes. No definite focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
