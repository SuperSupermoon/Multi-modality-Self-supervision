A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid to distal SVC. The patient is somewhat rotated on today's study which limits assessment of the cardiomediastinal contour however this appears grossly unchanged. There has been improvement in the right basilar atelectasis, there is persistent left lower lobe collapse. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. The remainder of visualized lungs appear grossly clear. Surgical hardware in the cervical and thoracic spine is incompletely evaluated.
