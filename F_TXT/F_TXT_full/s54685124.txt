The right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. The ET tube terminates in the lower trachea. Left midlung perihilar airspace opacities have slightly increased. There is no pneumothorax. Stable mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to a small pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged.
