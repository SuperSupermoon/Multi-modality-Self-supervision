Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. Moderate left-sided pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis is not significantly changed over the interval. Slight interval improvement in aeration of the upper lungs bilaterally. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter placed from a femoral approach ends in the region of the left main pulmonary artery. Endotracheal tube ends 5 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view. No pneumothorax.
