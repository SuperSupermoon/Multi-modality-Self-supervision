There no prior chest radiographs available for review. Marked asymmetry in the appearance of the lungs could be due to unilateral left pulmonary edema. This might be due to previous left cubitus positioning. The heart is moderately enlarged. Both pulmonary arteries are large suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pleural effusions small on the left if any. No pneumothorax.
