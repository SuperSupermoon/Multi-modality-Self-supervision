AP chest compared to ___: There is no good evidence for pneumonia in the right lung. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and considerable dilatation of hilar vasculature suggest cardiac decompensation instead and increasing small right pleural effusion. Left lower lobe is largely airless, but slight leftward shift of the lower mediastinum suggests this is likely atelectasis, now accompanied by a small left pleural effusion. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
