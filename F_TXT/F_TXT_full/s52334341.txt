Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiac size is top normal. The aorta is tortuous. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. Left IJ catheter tip is in unchanged position at the junction of the brachiocephalic vein. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Right lower lobe opacity has minimally increased. This could be due to atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There is mild vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. A drain projects in the right upper quadrant.
