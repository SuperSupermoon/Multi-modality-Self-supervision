Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with mild shift of midline structures to the left, suggesting a large component of lung collapse. The right lung appears clear. The imaged osseous structures are intact. The reported tracheal stent cannot be clearly visualized.
