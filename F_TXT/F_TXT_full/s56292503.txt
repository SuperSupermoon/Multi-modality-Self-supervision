As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone right thoracoscopy. The patient now has two right-sided chest tubes that are in correct position. There is no evidence for the presence of a right pneumothorax. A small amount of air is included in the soft tissues at the site of tube insertion. The pre-existing right pleural effusion has substantially decreased in extent. However, an atelectasis has newly occurred at the level of the left lung base. Mild cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema persists.
