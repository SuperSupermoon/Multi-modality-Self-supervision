Comparison is made to previous study performed 14 hours earlier. There is an endotracheal tube, left-sided PICC line, right-sided central line, right IJ central line, nasogastric tube, and endotracheal tube which are all appropriately sited and unchanged. The heart size is enlarged. There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity. There is some atelectasis at the lung bases and likely a left-sided pleural effusion which is stable. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces.
