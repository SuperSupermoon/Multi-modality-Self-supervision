AP chest compared to ___ and ___, and ___ ___: Patient has had left upper thoracoplasty, usually for tuberculosis or lung cancer. Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung has worsened since ___, probably pulmonary edema, accompanied by increasing small right pleural effusion. Predominant abnormality in the axillary region of the right upper lobe could be concurrent pneumonia, but I am not surprised by asymmetric distribution of edema in this patient with moderate-to-severe emphysema and scarring at the right lung apex. Heart size is normal, in the leftward shifted mediastinum. No pneumothorax.
