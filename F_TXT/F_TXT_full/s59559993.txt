Endotracheal tube and Dobbhoff tube are unchanged and in standard positions. A new left upper extremity PICC tip projects 8.5 cm below the level of the carina, and should be withdrawn 3 cm for more optimal positioning at the cavoatrial junction. Airspace opacities bilaterally, right greater than left and favoring the upper lobes, likely represent a combination of aspiration and atelectasis and are improving from yesterday's CTA except for focal worsening in left lower lobe. Mild perihilar pulmonary vascular congestion is present. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours remain normal.
