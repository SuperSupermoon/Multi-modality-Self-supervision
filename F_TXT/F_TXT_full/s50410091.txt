The cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the presence of bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right. Heart size is likely mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. There is evidence of mild pulmonary edema. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis. No large pneumothorax is identified.
