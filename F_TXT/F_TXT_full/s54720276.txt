Again seen is the right-sided chest tube. There is increased lucency at the right apex and although it is difficult to visualize the precise margin of the lung, it is felt that the pneumothorax is slightly increased compared to the study from the prior evening. There is also increased right-sided subcutaneous emphysema. There is increased volume loss in both lower lungs, right greater than left with an elevated right hemidiaphragm. Focal infiltrate in either lower lobe cannot be totally excluded.
