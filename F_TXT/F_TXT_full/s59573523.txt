Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. Low lung volumes with patchy opacity at the right base likely reflecting atelectasis, less likely aspiration or pneumonia. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Calcific density overlying the body of the left scapula consistent with known sub scapularis calcific tendinitis.
