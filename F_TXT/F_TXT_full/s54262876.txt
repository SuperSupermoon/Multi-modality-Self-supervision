Single portable view of the chest. Exam is limited secondary to portable technique and patient's body positioning. The increased retrocardiac opacity suggestive of hiatal hernia. Left base opacity is also seen with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise within normal limits given severely limited exam. Bones are diffusely osteopenic. There is coarsened trabecular pattern of the proximal left humerus suggestive of pagetoid changes.
