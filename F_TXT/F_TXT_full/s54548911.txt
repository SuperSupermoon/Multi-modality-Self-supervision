No previous images. Low lung volumes accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Some indistinctness of possibly engorged pulmonary vessels suggests some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Increased opacification at the right base most likely represents crowding of pulmonary vessels and the cardiophrenic angle. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. There is also the vague suggestion of some increased opacification at the left base laterally, which could represent merely atelectatic changes or possible early consolidation.
