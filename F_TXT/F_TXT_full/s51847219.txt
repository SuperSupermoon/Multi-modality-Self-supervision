Increased opacity at the right lung base likely reflects a combination of pleural fluid and consolidation as seen on the prior CT. Apical pleural fluid is also noted. The extent of airspace opacity/ consolidation is slightly improved compared to the earlier chest radiograph. The left lung appears grossly clear. No pneumothorax seen. The visualized bony structures are unremarkable in appearance.
