Following removal of a right pleural catheter, a small right apical pneumothorax is essentially unchanged in size. Small right pleural effusion also appears similar. Diffuse mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy are unchanged. Left retrocardiac opacity also appears similar to the prior study and may reflect atelectasis and/or infectious consolidation. Adjacent moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged.
