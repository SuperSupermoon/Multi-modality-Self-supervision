Since the 5:31 a.m. examination, there has been improved aeration of the left lower lobe, likely reflecting post-bronchoscopic change. However an underlying flat fluid level raises the suspicion for possible superimposed pneumo/hydro-thorax. There remains severe left lower lobe atelectasis. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. The endotracheal tube, orogastric tube, and left subclavian lines are unchanged in position. There is no pneumothorax. A small left pleural effusion is again seen. There is central pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema.
