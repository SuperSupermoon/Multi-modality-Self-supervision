The ET tube lies approximately 4.1 cm above the carina, at the level of the inferior edge of the clavicular heads. The OG tube extends beneath the diaphragm, off film. Again seen are hazy bibasilar opacities. On the right, the right hemidiaphragm itself is now visible, although there is likely some layering fluid. There is continued retrocardiac opacity with obscuration left hemidiaphragm and probable layering left pleural effusion. Vascular plethora seen in the upper portion of both lungs is compatible with CHF.
