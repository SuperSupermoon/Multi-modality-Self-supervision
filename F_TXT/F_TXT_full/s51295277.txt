The endotracheal tube is somewhat low in position, terminating approximately 9 in 10 mm above level the carina. Recommend withdrawal by approximately 2 to 2.5 cm for more optimal positioning. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm into the expected location of the stomach. Low lung volumes persist. Interval prominence of the perihilar vasculature may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement in combination with low lung volumes. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
