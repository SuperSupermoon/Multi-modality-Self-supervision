AP chest compared to ___: There has been very little change over the past week, and radiographic findings in ___ were similar, specifically small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions and moderately severe bibasilar atelectasis or consolidation and only relatively mild pulmonary vascular engorgement in the upper lungs. The findings suggest that atelectasis and retained pleural fluid are the major active problems. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements, nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. Upper abdominal drains noted, but cannot be localized on the frontal view alone.
