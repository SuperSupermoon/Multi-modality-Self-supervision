Following removal of right-sided chest tube, there is no visible pneumothorax. Stable postoperative widening of cardiomediastinal contours. Improved pulmonary edema which has nearly resolved. Residual asymmetrical airspace opacity in right upper lobe has slightly worsened, however, and could reflect asymmetrical edema or a superimposed process such as aspiration. Bibasilar atelectasis and small left pleural effusion are unchanged.
