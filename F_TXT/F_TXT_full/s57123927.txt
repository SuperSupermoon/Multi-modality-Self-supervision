The tracheostomy tip is approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. The right subclavian line tip is at the level of mid SVC. The patient is after placement of the percutaneous gastrostomy. The right chest tube is in place. Substantial amount of subcutaneous air is seen, although minimally improved since the prior study. Loculated air collections are noted bilaterally, unchanged in the short interim. Prominence of the pulmonary arteries, consistent with pulmonary hypertension, as well as bullous changes in the apices, are redemonstrated. No definitive pneumothorax is seen. Right lower lobe consolidation with internal areas of cavitation is better assessed on the CT torso obtained on ___.
