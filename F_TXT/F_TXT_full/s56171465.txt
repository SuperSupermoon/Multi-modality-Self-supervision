In comparison with study of ___, there is no convincing evidence of pneumoperitoneum. There is a thin lucency along the medial aspect of the right hemidiaphragm that could represent a sliver of free air, though would also merely be a manifestation of an area of lung between the hemidiaphragm and atelectasis above it. This is not a true upright image. If there is serious clinical concern for perforation, CT would be the next imaging procedure.
