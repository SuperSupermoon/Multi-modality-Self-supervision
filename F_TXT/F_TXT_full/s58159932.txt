Lung volumes are exceedingly low, exaggerating mild cardiomegaly, but pulmonary vasculature is more engorged than it was earlier. Small right pleural effusion has grown. There is a suggestion of the large hiatus hernia at the base of the left lung, and several more nodular areas of opacity in the right base. Overall, above the lung findings are nonspecific and confusing. CT scanning would help conform likely bilateral pneumonia and cardiac decompensation. Transvenous atrioventricular pacer leads are continuous from the left axillary generator.
