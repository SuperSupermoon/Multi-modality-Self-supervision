AP chest compared to ___.m.: Dobbhoff tube has been removed. There is a suggestion of new opacification at the left lung apex. I would repeat chest radiographs later today to see if this is developing consolidation or other clinically significant abnormality. Lungs are otherwise clear. Heart size is normal and there is no pleural effusion. There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum. Dr. ___ was paged to report these findings, at 4:30 p.m. as soon as they were recognized and we discussed them and the need for followup by telephone.
