The lungs are slightly better aerated and slightly better expanded. There is increased opacity in the left lower hemithorax, a combination of increasing pleural effusion and atelectasis. Right upper lobe opacity is grossly unchanged. Small right effusion and adjacent atelectasis has also minimally increased. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with mild cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax. Tracheostomy is in unchanged position. Large left central catheter tips are in the lower SVC.
