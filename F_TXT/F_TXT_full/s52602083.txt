Right-sided PICC is in unchanged position. There has been interval removal of the left-sided internal jugular venous catheter. A moderate right-sided effusion persists and is not significantly changed in size from the prior examination. Pulmonary opacity involving the base of the right lung is stable and likely reflects atelectasis or infection in the appropriate setting. The left lung is clear. There is no pneumothorax.
