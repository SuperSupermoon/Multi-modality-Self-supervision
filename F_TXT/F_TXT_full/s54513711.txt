Since the previous radiograph of several hours earlier, a Dobbhoff tube has been replaced and coils within the stomach, with distal tip directed cephalad. Moderate bilateral pneumothoraces are in retrospect unchanged from the prior radiograph, with bilateral chest tubes in place. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Interval improvement in extent of bibasilar atelectasis. Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
