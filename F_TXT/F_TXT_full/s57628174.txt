Less penetrated film compared with the prior study. Again seen is the tip of the ET tube above the level of the clavicular heads, similar in position. Also again seen is an NG tube that extends beneath the diaphragm off the film, a right IJ central line tip overlying the right atrium, and a right-sided chest tube overlying the right upper zone. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged, with note again made of prominent enlargement of the mediastinum. There is marked upper zone redistribution, more pronounced than on the prior film. With increased vascular plethora and vascular blurring. Hazy opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle probably represents combination of a small amount of pleural fluid in atelectasis. Inspiratory volumes are again noted to be low. Known bilateral rib fractures are incompletely visualized. The tip of the suprarenal IVC filter is noted.
