1. Right internal jugular central line, right subclavian central line, endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, right pleural pigtail catheter, left-sided chest tubes and dual-lumen left subclavian arterial line are unchanged in position. There continues to be extensive left lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema. A left apical and basilar pneumothorax may be slightly smaller than on the prior study. There is no definite right apical pneumothorax, although there is some accentuated lucency at the right base which would raise the possibility of a basilar component. Imaging of the patient in the erect position may be helpful to exclude this possibility. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pulmonary edema. Focal patchy opacities in both upper lobes may represent areas of atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should be considered.
