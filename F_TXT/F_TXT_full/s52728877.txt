Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates continued low lung volumes with linear atelectasis at the left base, which appears mildly improved since the prior radiograph. The right basilar opacity appears slightly more confluent, possibly indicating developing pneumonia. Otherwise, there is no area of focal consolidation. The mediastinal and cardiac contours are unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely. No pneumothorax is detected.
