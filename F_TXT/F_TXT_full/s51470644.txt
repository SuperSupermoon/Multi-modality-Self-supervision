In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes have been removed, with a right IJ sheath remaining in place. Continued relatively low lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle with indistinctness of the outer portion of the hemidiaphragm could reflect mild atelectasis and small pleural he fusion. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
