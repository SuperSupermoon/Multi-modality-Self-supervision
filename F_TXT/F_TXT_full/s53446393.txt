As compared to the previous radiograph, there is substantial progression of the already moderate pulmonary edema seen on the previous film. The edema is centralized in distribution and affects both the left and the right lung. Extent of the pre-existing pleural effusions that are limited to the costophrenic areas, is constant. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with shape of the cardiac silhouette, potentially indicating a small pericardial effusion. Unchanged position of the left pectoral pacemaker.
