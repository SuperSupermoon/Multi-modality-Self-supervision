Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Indistinct pulmonary vasculature markings are compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. Increased opacity at the right lung base is compatible with atelectasis or infection. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is compatible with a small to moderate sized pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.
