Compared to ___, post extubation decrease in lung volume and increased in intrathoracic pressure likely accounts for mildly increased heart size. Perihilar opacity, left worse than right likely reflects mild pulmonary edema. Linear opacities in bilateral bases and left mid lung likely represent atelectasis. There is small left pleural effusions, if any. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Right central line terminates in right atrium. Sternal wires are aligned and intact.
