Compared with ___ at 16:26, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen are bibasilar opacities, similar in extent, and upper zone redistribution. Cardiomegaly is grossly stable. Background hyperinflation is again noted. NG tube and left subclavian PICC line are similar in appearance. The previously seen looping of the tube in the hypopharynx is not visualized on the current examination.
