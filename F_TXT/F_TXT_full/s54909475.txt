Endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of view. Right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid to distal SVC. Portion of the patient's percutaneous nephrostomy tube appears to project over the right upper abdomen that is incompletely assessed. Bilateral predominantly central perihilar opacities persist which accompanied by indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature and bilateral pleural effusions suggest pulmonary edema. More confluent consolidations are seen in the right upper lung and left mid-lung and could reflect superimposed pneumonia. A component of basilar atelectasis is also present. The heart and mediastinum are unremarkable.
