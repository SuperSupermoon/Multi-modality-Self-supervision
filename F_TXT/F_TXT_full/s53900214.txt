Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest. ETT is in unchanged position ending 2 cm above the carina. The right subclavian dialysis catheter is in unchanged position in the lower right atrium. A left internal jugular central venous catheter ends at the cavoatrial junction. An enteric tube ends in the lower esophagus. Severe pulmonary edema is unchanged with likely bilateral moderate effusions. Bibasilar opacities could reflect a combination of effusion and atelectasis; although, underlying infection or aspiration would be possible in the correct clinical setting.
