Tracheostomy is in place. A left-sided pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle is noted. A right-sided PICC line is present with its tip terminating in the mid to distal SVC. A presumed shunt catheter is seen traversing the right neck, chest and upper abdomen. Sternotomy wires and valvuloplasty are noted. A retrocardiac opacity unchanged and likely represents persistent left lower lobe collapse. Patchy atelectasis at the right lung base appears improved since prior study. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is unchanged and normal. The mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
