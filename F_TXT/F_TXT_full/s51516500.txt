Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position, including a new left internal jugular vascular catheter, terminating in the lower superior vena cava. Heart size remains normal. Streaky opacities in the juxtahilar regions appear similar to the previous exam, and probably correspond to areas of peribronchial thickening and adjacent peribronchiolar opacity in this patient with clinical diagnosis of RVC. This is most marked in the right infrahilar region and appears unchanged from recent studies. No new areas of localized consolidation are identified to suggest a superimposed bacterial pneumonia.
