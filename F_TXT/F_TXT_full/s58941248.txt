Persistent left greater than right basal streaky opacities likely reflect atelectasis which cleared to some degree on the subsequent study. No focal consolidation is seen with mild vascular congestion less pronounced than on the previous examination. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this portable AP view. The heart is likely top normal in size with intact median sternotomy wires and otherwise normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Slight right sided indentation of the trachea may reflect thyroid goiter.
