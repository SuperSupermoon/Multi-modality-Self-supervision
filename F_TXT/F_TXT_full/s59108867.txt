Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier. Enlarged cardiac silhouette and widened mediastinum due to lymphadenopathy is unchanged. Diffuse lung opacities have minimally improved in the bases due to better inspiration, but in general they remain the same. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. This corresponds to acute exacerbation of a chronic fibrotic process NSIP. This acute exacerbation could be inflammatory or infectious.
