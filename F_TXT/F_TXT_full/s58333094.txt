AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: ET tube is in standard placement, although the cuff distends the trachea and its upper margin is sharply defined by pooled secretions. There is no good evidence for pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Bilateral pulmonary abnormalities consist largely of consolidation in the right upper lobe, perihilar edema on the left. Heart size is normal. When feasible, an upright chest radiograph would be helpful to evaluate the possibility of pneumothorax collected anteriorly. Heart size normal.
