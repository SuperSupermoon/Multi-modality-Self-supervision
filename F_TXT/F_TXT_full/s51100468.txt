AP portable upright view of the chest. The lungs appear hyperinflated likely due to underlying emphysema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions with mild bibasilar atelectasis. There is no overt edema. A subtle peripheral linear density in the right upper lung close to the EKG lead may represent a focus of scarring or atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Heart is top-normal. Mediastinal contours unremarkable. Bony structures appear intact though demineralized station is noted diffusely.
