This is an upright film and there are decreased bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Right IJ line tip is in the mid SVC. Again seen is dense retrocardiac opacity and volume loss in both lower lungs. There continues to be pulmonary vascular redistribution, perihilar infiltrates and alveolar infiltrates most marked in the right lung. The overall impression is of CHF but an underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
