The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates near the inlet to the stomach and a sidehole marker projects over the distal esophagus. A right internal central jugular venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There are probably small-to-moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions. The heart is probably normal in size. Mild fullness of central pulmonary vessels suggests venous hypertension. Streaky left basilar opacities are probably due to minor atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
