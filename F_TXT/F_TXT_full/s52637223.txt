The lung volumes have decreased, with a subsequent increase in vascular crowding. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. Minimal fluid overload, but no overt pulmonary edema. Technical limitations of the image given overlay by the right hand and extensive monitoring and support devices. No larger pleural effusions.
