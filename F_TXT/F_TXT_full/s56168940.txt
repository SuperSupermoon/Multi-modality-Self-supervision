Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates endotracheal tube terminating 2.1 cm above the carina. Nasoenteric tube is seen coursing through the esophagus, its tip out of field of view. The right PIC catheter tip projects over cavoatrial junction. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip projects over distal SVC. Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent areas of atelectasis are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema has improved. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. 3.5 cm round rim calcification projecting over descending aorta represents saccular aneurysm, better characterized on ___ CT, unchanged.
