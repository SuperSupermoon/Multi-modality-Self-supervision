Again seen is a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter, with tip overlying the right pulmonary artery. I doubt significant interval change in position. Slight differences in relation to the vertical portion of the catheter in the IVC, compared to the prior film, may be accounted for by differences in the patient positioning. However, when compared to the film from ___, the tip of the Swan-___ catheter is more distal. No pneumothorax is detected Again seen is a left-sided pacemaker/ defibrillator device with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle and with additional lead unchanged. There is marked cardiomegaly, similar to the prior film. There is upper zone redistribution. Possible mild interval increase in degree of pulmonary vascular plethora. No focal consolidation or gross effusion is identified.
