AP chest compared to ___: Previous cardiomegaly, on ___, has resolved. There is no pulmonary edema. The most significant focal pulmonary abnormality is in the right lower lung. There has been improvement in both volume and opacification of what were largely atelectatic and conceivably also consolidated right middle and lower lobes. Atelectasis at the left base is mild. Small left pleural effusion is visible. Small right pleural effusion is presumed, but not clinically significant. With the chin elevated, the tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 25 mm above the carina. It could be withdrawn 15 mm to avoid inadvertent unilateral intubation if the patient strongly flexes the neck and chin. Left subclavian line ends centrally. No pneumothorax.
