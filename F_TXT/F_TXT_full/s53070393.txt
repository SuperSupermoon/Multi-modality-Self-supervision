In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the appearance of the chest tube at the right base with no evidence of pneumothorax. There is slightly more blunting of the right costophrenic angle. This could represent some re-accumulation of pleural fluid, although it could also be merely a slightly more supine position of the patient. The remainder the study is unchanged.
