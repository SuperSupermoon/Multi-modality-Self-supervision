Right PICC terminates in the region of the the cavoatrial junction, possibly overlying the upper right atrium. Bibasilar opacities are similar to before which may reflect atelectasis, however pneumonia is difficult to exclude. There is near complete obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. Small left pleural effusion is similar to before. There is no large right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Lung slightly volume is low the film is obtained in lordotic position. The cardiac silhouette is probably enlarged, but somewhat exaggerated by these technical factors. Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette is exaggerated by the low lung volumes. There is mild upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora improved compared with ___. .
