In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support device has been removed except for a right IJ sheath. There is a small right apical pneumothorax. There is increased opacification at the bases consistent with layering effusions and compressive atelectasis, more prominent on the right. Fullness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevated pulmonary venous pressure, and there is increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette.
