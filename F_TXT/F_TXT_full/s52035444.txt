Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable. Transvenous pacemaker leads are in standard position. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Right PICC tip is partially obscured by the leads and outside monitor leads, previously was seen in the right atrium. In the current radiograph, I cannot assess the tip. I can follow it to the cavoatrial junction. Mild vascular congestion and retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged.
