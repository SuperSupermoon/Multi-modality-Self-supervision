Comparison is made with prior study performed nine hours earlier. ET tube is in appropriate position; the tip is 3.5 cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. The patient is still very rotated. Right upper lobe opacities have worsened. Left lower lobe opacities have improved. Right lower lobe opacities have improved. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are probably stable allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
