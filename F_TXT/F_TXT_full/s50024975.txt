Single AP supine portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.4 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, coiled in what is likely the stomach. There is a left-sided internal jugular central venous catheter which terminates in the low SVC. There are relatively low lung volumes. Prominence of the hila is likely related to pulmonary edema. Patchy left basilar opacity could relate to pulmonary edema, although underlying aspiration is not excluded. No large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is likely accentuated by AP, supine technique, but may be mildly enlarged. Also, there is mild prominence of the superior mediastinum which is also most likely accentuated by supine position and AP technique. If there is clinical concern for acute mediastinal injury, chest CTA is more sensitive.
