Since the prior study, there has been interval thoracentesis, with removal of fluid from a left apical hydro pneumothorax. The aerated portion of the pneumothorax remains, unchanged in size compared to the prior study. The appearance of the right hemi thorax is stable. The cardio mediastinal silhouette is also unchanged.
