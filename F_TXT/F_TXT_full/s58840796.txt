In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the nasogastric tube lies within the lower distal portion of the esophagus just about at the level of the esophagogastric junction. The tube should be pushed forward several cm. There are continued low lung volumes with mild atelectatic changes at the bases. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion. The abdominal contents as visualized are within normal limits though a specific abdominal image would be necessary for further evaluation. As on several previous images, there is suggestion of impression on the lower right side of the cervical trachea, raising the possibility of a thyroid mass.
