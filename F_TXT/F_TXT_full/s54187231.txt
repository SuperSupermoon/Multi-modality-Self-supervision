The lung volumes are low and the bases of the chest are opacified, obscuring the cardiac margins. This appearance probably includes pleural effusions with atelectasis or consolidation in the lower lobes including air bronchograms. Perihilar opacities suggest pulmonary congestion. A more peripheral opacity projecting over the right upper lobe and layering along the minor fissure may be due to a region of focal edema or collecting pleural fluid. However, this area should be reexamined in follow-up as a potential developing focus of pneumonia.
