Since 1 day prior, a a loculated right apical and lateral pleural effusion has decreased in size, a motor edema is decreased, and retrocardiac atelectasis is decreased. A small, dependent right pleural effusion has probably increased in size. The apices are incompletely visualized, but no obvious pneumothorax. Severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal widening are unchanged. An ETT terminates 6.2 cm above the carina. A left sided IJ Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the main pulmonary artery. An enteric tube terminates in the proximal stomach. Bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal drains appear unchanged in position.
