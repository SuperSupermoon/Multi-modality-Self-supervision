1. Lungs appear mildly hyperinflated. There is asymmetric left apical pleural thickening. In addition, there are at least three discrete nodular opacities seen in the right upper lobe, right lower lobe and left lower lobe. In the absence of comparison studies, although these may represent granulomas, this cannot be ascertained with certainty and therefore either comparison to remote chest films or a dedicated imaging with CT should be considered at this time. No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. No pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The patient's nurse, ___, was notified by phone of these findings on ___ at 9:17 a.m. at the time of discovery.
