The appearance of the left chest tube and left subclavian line is unchanged. No pneumothorax is identified on the left. There are bilateral pleural effusions. There is increased pulmonary vascular redistribution and alveolar infiltrates, predominantly in the right lower lobe. There is dense retrocardiac opacity. The overall impression is that of worsened fluid status.
