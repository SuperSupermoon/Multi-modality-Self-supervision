AP upright portable chest radiograph was provided. Midline sternotomy wires are noted as well as mediastinal clips. A rounded density projects over the left mediastinal border which is of unclear etiology. Enlargement of the main pulmonary arterial silhouette suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension. The heart is mildly enlarged. The lungs appear grossly clear, though perihilar opacities could reflect bronchovascular crowding. No pneumothorax or effusion. Clips in the left upper quadrant noted. EKG leads and a catheter overlie the field of view somewhat limiting evaluation.
