There has been interval re-positioning of the right internal jugular central venous catheter, which now terminates in appropriate position in the distal SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the appearance of the chest is unchanged since the prior study. Hazy density at the right base with aparent retraction of the minor fissure is suggestive of prominent right middle lobe atelectasis. If clinically indicated, a lateral view could help to confirm this. Is there any concern for airway obstruction?
