1. Right subclavian PICC line and left subclavian Port-A-Cath are unchanged. There continues to be a complete opacification of the right upper lung where there are chain sutures likely reflecting complete collapse of the right upper lobe and tumor infiltration related to a known right hilar mass. Remaining aerated right mid and lower lungs are stable in appearance although demonstrate patchy and nodular opacities throughout. The left lung continues to have areas of consolidation and atelectasis. A new patchy opacity is now seen in the left upper lung, which may represent an early pneumonia or an area of patchy atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen. Small to moderate bilateral effusions persist. There continues to be a large amount of free air within the peritoneal cavity consistent with a pneumoperitoneum.
