The patient remains intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 4 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its tip not imaged. A Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction. A new right internal central jugular venous catheter terminates in the uppermost part of the atrium. Within the limitations of technique, the heart is probably normal in size. An indistinct appearance to each hilum suggests mild vascular congestion. There is again a vague focal opacity projecting over the right mid upper lung but less distinct. Patchy left infrahilar opacity with air bronchograms is another non-specific appearance for which attention in short-term followup is recommended. There is no pneumothorax.
