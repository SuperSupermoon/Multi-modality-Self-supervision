In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal tube is probably about 2.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is in place with the tip extending at least to the mid body of the stomach, where it crosses the lower margin of the image. The cardiac silhouette remains within upper limits of normal in size, though there is some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure that appears to have worsened since the prior study. Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen, though no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
