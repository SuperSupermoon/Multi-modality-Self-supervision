As compared to the previous radiograph, the right rib fixations are in unchanged position. On the left, a pre-existing pleural effusion and elevation of the hemidiaphragm has decreased in severity. However, the left hemidiaphragm is still elevated and areas of atelectasis and, potentially, a small left pleural effusion are still present. Retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.
