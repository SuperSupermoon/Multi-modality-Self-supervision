Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a right-sided chest tube, the tip of which approaches the midline mediastinum. The sidehole marker is not appreciated on this study. Bibasilar opacities remain, there appears to have been interval improvement in pneumothorax, though the evaluation of lung markings is limited on this study due to overlying soft tissue gas. There remains extensive soft tissue gas outlining the pectoralis muscles bilaterally, as well as right subcutaneous tissues. The remainder of support lines and tubes are stable in appearance.
