Comparison was done with prior study performed three hours earlier. ET tube tip is 5.7 cm above the carina. There are two left chest tube tubes with decrease in small to moderate left pneumothorax. Lower lobe opacities are likely reexpansion edema. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Increasing opacities in the right lower lobe are consistent with increasing atelectasis in the right upper lobe and probably collapse in the right middle lobe. Right subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC. Cardiomediastinal structures are midline.
