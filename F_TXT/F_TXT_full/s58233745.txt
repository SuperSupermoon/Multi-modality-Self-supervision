The lung volumes are normal. Lateral pleural thickening with calcifications. These project over the lung parenchyma and create the appearance of nodular changes. Moreover, they limit the assessment of the radiographic appearance of the lung parenchyma in both lower lung parts. Presence of a subtle parenchymal abnormality, therefore, cannot be determined. Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema. No evidence of pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
