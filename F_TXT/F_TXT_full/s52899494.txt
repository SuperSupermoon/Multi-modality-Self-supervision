Lung volumes are low. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature which most likely reflect mild pulmonary edema. Linear opacity in the right mid lung zone is likely atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is no definite focal consolidation or pleural effusion, although study is slightly limited by body habitus.
