Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube. Cardiomegaly is accompanied by improved vascular congestion. Additionally, heterogeneous opacities in the mid and lower lung regions show interval improvement, and could reflect improving asymmetrical edema or aspiration. Continued radiographic followup recommended to exclude the possibility of infectious pneumonia. Small pleural effusions have decreased in the interval as well.
