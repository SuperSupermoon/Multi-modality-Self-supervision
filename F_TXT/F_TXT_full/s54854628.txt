A tracheostomy catheter and right approach central venous line are in unchanged expected position. Catheters overlie the midline upper abdomen. Small consolidation within the right lower lobe is unchanged. Increasing retrocardiac density is likely due to new atelectasis. No overt interstitial edema is identified. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear similar to prior, allowing for differences in patient position.
