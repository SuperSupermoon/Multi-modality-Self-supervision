The endotracheal tube tip projects approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. An esophageal catheter courses below the diaphragm with tip out of view. Lung volumes are low with moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected on these views. Acute left-sided rib fractures with large adjacent hematoma are better seen on prior CT.
