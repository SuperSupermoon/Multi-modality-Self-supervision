In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been removed. The other monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. There is decrease in the opacification at the right base with sharp hemidiaphragmatic contours, most likely reflecting some combination of improved pleural effusion and flow of the effusion behind hemidiaphragm with the patient in the more erect position. Similarly, there is improvement in opacification at the left base, though some hazy opacification consistent with effusion is seen at the base and the hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen as on the opposite side. No evidence of vascular congestion.
