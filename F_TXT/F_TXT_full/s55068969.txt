An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip terminating below the thoracic inlet, approximately 3 cm above the carina. A right PICC is in place, with the tip overlying terminating in the low SVC. The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for size. Partial calcification at the aortic knob is noted. The hilar contours are within normal limits. The lungs are hyperinflated with lucency at the bilateral lung apices compatible with emphysema. Streaky bibasilar opacities may represent infection or aspiration. There is blunting at the left costophrenic angle compatible with a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is detected.
