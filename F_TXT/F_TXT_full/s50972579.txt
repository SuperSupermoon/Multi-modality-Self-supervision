Median sternotomy wires, LVAD device, and left chest wall pacemaker are again seen in unchanged position. There is stable, severe cardiomegaly. New, bilateral, ill-defined, perihilar infiltrates are consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. Focal opacity at the left base could reflect alveolar edema, although underlying pneumonia cannot be definitively excluded. New, mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle is consistent with a small right pleural effusion.
