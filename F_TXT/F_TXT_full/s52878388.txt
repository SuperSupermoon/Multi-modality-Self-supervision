The only focal pulmonary abnormality is the suggestion of right infrahilar consolidation, but this appearance is not very different than that on many prior chest radiographs. Conventional PA and lateral views would be helpful. Heart is top-normal size. Upper lungs are clear and pulmonary vasculature is not dilated. There is no pleural abnormality.
