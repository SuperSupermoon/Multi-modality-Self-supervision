AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm, terminating in the stomach. The left central venous line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Widespread parenchymal opacities are overall unchanged and might reflect pulmonary edema. Infection is a possibility, potentially in the lower lobes. As compared to chest CT obtained on ___, there is overall progression of multifocal opacities and again the concern of multifocal pneumonia is very high.
