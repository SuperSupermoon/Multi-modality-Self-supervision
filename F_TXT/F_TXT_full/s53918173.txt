AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding study performed one hour earlier during the same day. During the interval, the position of the Swan-Ganz catheter has been adjusted and is now seen to point with its tip towards the right of the midline being located in the central portion of the pulmonary artery. The previously described bent of the tip has been eliminated. No other interval changes are seen.
