Radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for assessment of a nasogastric tube, which terminates within the stomach. Within the chest, note is made of cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, and worsening edema as well as development of a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion. Left pleural effusion and adjacent basilar atelectasis have also slightly worsened.
