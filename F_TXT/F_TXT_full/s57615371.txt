Compared with the prior film, a left-sided pigtail catheter has been placed. The known left pneumothorax, seen on the ___ C-spine CT continues to be radiographically occult. Inspiratory volumes are improved slightly. There is continued patchy retrocardiac opacity, with air bronchograms, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Minimal atelectasis at the right base. The aortic knob and left paratracheal soft tissue density are slightly improved. Left mid clavicular fracture again noted.
