A nasogastric tube has been placed, terminating in the stomach. If clinically indicated, it could be advanced somewhat to gain better purchase in the stomach, however, noting that the sidehole lies near the gastroesophageal junction. The heart is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable, allowing for technique. There is perhaps slight fluid overload or minimal vascular congestion. Patchy left basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis. There are no definite pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Free air is not so conspicuous as it was on the prior study beneath each hemidiaphragm but smaller quantities of free air can be seen beneath the medial side of the right hemidiaphragm and about a segment of colon in the left upper quadrant.
