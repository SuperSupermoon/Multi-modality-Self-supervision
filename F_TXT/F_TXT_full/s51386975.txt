Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The left costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. There are relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings, particularly at the bases. Given this, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
