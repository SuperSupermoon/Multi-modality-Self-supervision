Stable enlargement of cardiac silhouette with pericardial drain now in place. No evidence of pneumopericardium or pneumothorax. Worsening left retrocardiac opacity is probably a combination of atelectasis and effusion. There may also be a small pleural effusion on the right, as the lateral costophrenic angle is less well defined than on the previous exam.
