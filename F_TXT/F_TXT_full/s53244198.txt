There is again increase in the right lung base opacification, part of it is explained by pleural effusion, but is still worrisome for pneumonia. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.

Possible persistence of the left upper lobe consolidation described on the CT could be reassessed with CT if clinically warranted. There is no pneumothorax.
