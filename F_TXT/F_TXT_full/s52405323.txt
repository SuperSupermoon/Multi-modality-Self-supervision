As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the endotracheal tube, are unchanged. The tip of the endotracheal tube now projects approximately 7 cm above the carina and could be advanced slightly, by approximately 1 to 2 cm. Minimal blunting of the costophrenic sinus on the left suggests the presence of a small left pleural effusion, combined to a pre-existing retrocardiac atelectasis. No overt pulmonary edema. No pneumonia. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
