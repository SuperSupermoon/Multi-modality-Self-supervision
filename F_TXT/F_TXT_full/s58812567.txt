Compared to the prior study, the orientation of the tracheostomy tube is unchanged. There is more volume loss in the right upper lobe with superior displacement of the minor fissure. Atelectasis at the left base is essentially unchanged and retrocardiac opacities are still present, which may represent aspiration or atelectasis. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusions are seen. Right PICC line is stable.
