A single portable upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a right chest port with catheter terminating at the cavoatrial junction. There is a nasoenteric tube passing through the esophagus, through the stomach, and terminating inferiorly out of the field of view, possibly within the jejunum. The lungs are clear. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
