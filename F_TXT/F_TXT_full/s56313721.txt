Bilateral perihilar opacification has developed in the setting of preexisting pulmonary vascular congestion, probably pulmonary edema. Moderate left pleural effusion is larger. Previous left lower lobe consolidation is still present, raising concern for pneumonia. Tip of the endotracheal tube, at the carina, should be withdrawn 3 cm. Clinical service will be contacted depending on results of subsequent chest radiograph. Nasogastric tube ends in the lower esophagus and would need to be advanced at least 15 cm to reach the stomach. Right jugular catheter ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
