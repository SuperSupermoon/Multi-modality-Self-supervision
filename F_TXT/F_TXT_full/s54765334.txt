Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm. Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the distal SVC. The endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Likely small layering effusions with increased consolidation in the retrocardiac area which may reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
