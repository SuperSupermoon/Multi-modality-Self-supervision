Lungs are low in volume and as far as one can tell from a single frontal view, lungs are clear. Conventional PA and lateral views would be helpful to evaluate the lung bases, but the lung apices are clear. Heart size is top-normal. Mediastinal venous distension is long-standing. There is no pulmonary edema.
