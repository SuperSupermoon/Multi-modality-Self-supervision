AP chest compared to ___, most recently 12:43 p.m.: Previous consolidation in the right upper lung has improved substantially. The rapidity of change is not consistent with pneumonia, but could have been due to massive aspiration or asymmetric edema. Pulmonary hemorrhage would not clear this fast either. There is still substantial consolidation in the right lower lobe. Left lower lobe is partially obscured but may contain a new region of consolidation partially obscuring the hemidiaphragm. Since the pulmonary vasculature and the mediastinal veins are not engorged, I am doubtful that either of these is asymmetric edema and instead favor recurrent massive aspiration. Hyperinflation indicates COPD.
