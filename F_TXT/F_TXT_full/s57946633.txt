Sternal wires and mediastinal clips are again seen. The heart is moderately enlarged. There is bilateral lower lobe volume loss with hazy bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and some mild pulmonary vascular redistribution. It is unclear if the appearance of the lungs is due to pulmonary edema or infection. Overall, the appearance has worsened compared to the study from the prior day.
