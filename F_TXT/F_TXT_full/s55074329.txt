Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier. Dobbhoff tube was slightly advanced and the tip appears to be in the stomach. The most proximal portion is just at the EG junction. Bibasilar atelectases have improved, more so on the left. Vascular congestion is unchanged. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the proximal-to-mid SVC. There is no evident pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions.
