Single portable chest radiograph was provided. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm and terminates within the stomach. A right PICC terminates at the mid SVC. Again seen is plate-like atelectasis at the right base. Retrocardiac and left basilar opacity is similar to the prior radiographs and may represent a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. The heart remains enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. The bones are intact.
