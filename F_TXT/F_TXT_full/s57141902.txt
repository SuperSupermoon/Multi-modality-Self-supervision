Single frontal portable view of the chest was obtained. The heart is of normal size with normal cardiomediastinal contours. Lung volumes are low, causing slight crowding of bronchovascular markings. The lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation, nodule, or effusion. No pneumothorax. Osseous structures are unremarkable. No radiopaque foreign body.
