ET tube tip approximately 6.5 cm above the carina at the level of the mid clavicular heads. NG tube extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film. Right IJ central line tip is in the distal most SVC, adjacent to the SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax is detected. There is prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with a small left pleural effusion. There is atelectasis at the right lung base, with equivocal small effusion. Compared with 1 day earlier, there has been slight interval clearing at the left lung base laterally. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
