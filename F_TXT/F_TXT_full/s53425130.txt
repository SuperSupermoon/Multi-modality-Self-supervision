Single semi-erect view of the chest was obtained. Apparent increase in right pleural effusion is likely due to patient rotation with respect to the film. The top normal cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to prior. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax. A left approach central catheter terminates in the upper SVC. A new tracheostomy terminates in proper position. A new PEG overlies the left upper quadrant.
