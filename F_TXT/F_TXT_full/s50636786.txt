Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.8 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube tip is noted within the distal stomach. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted, and mild pulmonary vascular congestion is likely present. Additionally, more focal somewhat linear opacities within both upper lobes appear to be associated with fibrotic changes. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified, although the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. Diffuse gaseous distention of the bowel loops are noted within the upper abdomen. No acute osseous abnormality seen. Surgical anchors are noted projecting over the right shoulder.
