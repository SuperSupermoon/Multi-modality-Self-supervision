Postoperative widening of the mediastinum has decreased slightly. Diameter of the cardiac silhouette is also smaller. Moderate right pleural effusion has increased, probably accompanied by new right lower lobe atelectasis. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumonia; severe left lower lobe atelectasis is stable. Left pleural drain still in place. There is no appreciable left pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The surgical drain at the thoracic inlet and the gastroesophageal drainage tube, ending above the level of the diaphragm are unchanged in their respective positions.
