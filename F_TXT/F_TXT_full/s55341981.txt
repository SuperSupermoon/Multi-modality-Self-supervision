As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left internal jugular vein catheter. The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip of the catheter projects over the low SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. As compared to the previous image, the lung volumes have decreased, leading to a visual increase in radiodensity, notably at the lung bases, that makes the pre-existing parenchymal changes in the left lower lobe and right upper lobe appear slightly more dense. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged alignment of the sternal wires. Unchanged right upper abdominal pigtail catheter.
