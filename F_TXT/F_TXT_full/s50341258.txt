ET tube ends 2.2 cm above the carina. NG tube is in the stomach. Left-sided consolidation has improved but right-sided has worsened. The overall change from day to day is probably due to positioning and not to real change in the lung opacities. Pleural effusions are probably small. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.
