Right subclavian PICC line tip overlies proximal SVC, unchanged. Again seen are low inspiratory volumes. As before, there is moderately severe cardiomegaly prominence of both hila upper zone two-view shin and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF and interstitial edema. Increased retrocardiac density is similar to the previous film. Opacity in the right infrahilar region is also overall similar. The right hemidiaphragm may be slightly better defined. Though there is likely some degree of pleural fluid, no gross effusion is seen on either side.
