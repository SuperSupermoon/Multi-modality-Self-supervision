A left-sided Port-A-Cath terminates immediately above the cavoatrial junction. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is a new large lobular pleural-based opacity occupying the left mid to lower hemithorax suggesting an extensive loculated pleural effusion. There is a small free-flowing pleural effusion on the right although the right pleural effusion has decreased. Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear. Surgical clips project over the right upper quadrant.
