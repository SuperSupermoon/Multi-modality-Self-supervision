A left lower lobe pneumonia seen better on most recent chest CT is severe. There is atelectasis at the left lung base. Previously seen streaky opacities at the right lung base likely atelectasis have improved. Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
