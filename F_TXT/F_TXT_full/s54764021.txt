A right-sided internal jugular catheter, presumed trauma line is unchanged in appearance. Lung volumes are slightly low, likely due to a suboptimal and prior tree effort. This likely contributes to apparent widening of the superior mediastinum. No consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen. There is mild prominence of the pulmonary vascular structures, consistent with mild congestive heart failure or fluid overload but no frank pulmonary edema.
