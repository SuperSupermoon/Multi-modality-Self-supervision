Right-sided PICC terminates in the upper to mid SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. A right-sided catheter courses vertically over the chest and into the abdomen most likely representing a VP shunt. Subtle patchy left base retrocardiac opacity appears less prominent as compared the prior study may represent atelectasis rather than pneumonia. There is no pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion is seen. Tracheostomy tube is again noted.
