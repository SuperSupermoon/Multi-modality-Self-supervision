Tracheostomy tube and degenerative changes of the left humerus, probably post-traumatic, are again seen. There has been some minimal interval improvement in the interstitial process described on the film from the prior day. There are some patchy areas of increased opacity in the left base and right mid lung that could represent early focal consolidations. Followup is recommended.
