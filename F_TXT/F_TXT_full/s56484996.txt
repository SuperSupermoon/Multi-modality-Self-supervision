There has been interval placement of a right pleural catheter which is extremely difficult to visualize but is likely present at the right lung base. There is a new right apical pneumothorax measuring 1.2 cm. There has been interval slight decrease in the now moderately sized right pleural effusion. Left pleural effusion is stable in size. Cardiac size cannot be assessed due to these pleural effusions. Increased interstitial markings bilaterally may represent worsening pulmonary edema.
