In comparison with the study of ___, there are improved lung volumes. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size and there is continued opacification in the retrocardiac region consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe. Dense streak of atelectasis is seen at the left base and there is probably a small pleural effusion. The right lung is essentially clear. Right IJ catheter again extends to about the level of the cavoatrial junction.
