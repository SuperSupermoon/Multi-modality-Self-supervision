AP chest compared to ___: The patient is rotated considerably to the right. Moderate left pleural effusion has increased. There is probably also been an increase in mild-to-moderate but asymmetric pulmonary edema. Given the rotation I cannot be sure that there is no consolidation. Moderate cardiomegaly has increased. ET tube, right PIC line, right internal jugular catheter, are in standard placements. Feeding tube has been removed. An upright enteric drain passes as far as the level of the diaphragm where it is obscured by spinal hardware. No pneumothorax.
