Since the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, a left pleural catheter has apparently slightly changed in position, and left pleural effusion has decreased in size. Moderate to large right pleural effusion is probably similar in size considering differences in positioning between the exams, with right pleural catheter remaining in place. Remainder of exam is unchanged since recent study.
