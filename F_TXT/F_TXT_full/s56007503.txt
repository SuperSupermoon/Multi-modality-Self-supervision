Single portable AP upright radiograph demonstrates hyperinflated lungs and flattening of bilateral diaphragm most consistent with emphysematous changes. Heart size is slightly enlarged. There is no evidence of hilar adenopathy. There is no large pleural effusion. Opacities which project over the right lower lung zone are suspicious for an infectious process. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Biapical pleural parenchymal scarring is mild. Osseous structures and imaged upper abdomen are without an acute abnormality.
