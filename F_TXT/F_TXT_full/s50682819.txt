1. Right subclavian PIC line remains in place with the tip in the mid SVC. Status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. There has been interval improvement in a patchy medial air-space opacity consistent with resolved atelectasis. No focal air-space consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. Surgical chain sutures are again seen at the left apex. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are appreciated. There is some prominence of the perihilar vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema is seen.
