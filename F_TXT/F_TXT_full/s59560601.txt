Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in the postoperative period. Moderate-to-large layering left pleural effusion is again demonstrated and is difficult to compare to the prior study due to positional differences, but may be slightly increased in the interval. There remains adjacent atelectasis in the left lower lobe. New patchy right basilar atelectasis has developed with otherwise unchanged appearance of the right lung.
