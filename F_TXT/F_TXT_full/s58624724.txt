In comparison with the study ___ ___, the nasogastric tube extends at least to the lower body of the stomach where it crosses the lower margin of the image. There is suggestions that it may extend to the antrum and and her of on itself backwards. If the precise position of the tube is of clinical importance, an abdominal image could be obtained. The cardiac silhouette is stable. There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Hazy opacification at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic angle suggests layering pleural effusion with compressive basilar atelectasis.
