Interstitial and airspace opacities are worse and most easily explained by worsening moderate pulmonary edema. As the heart size is smaller than prior, though still mildly enlarged, a superimposed acute process cannot be excluded. Specifically, a more focal area of consolidation in the left lower lung may represent aspiration, pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema and attention should be paid to this area after diuresis. No large pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
