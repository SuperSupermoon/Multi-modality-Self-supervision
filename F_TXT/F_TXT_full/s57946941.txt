There are bilateral pleural effusions which are slightly larger than on the prior study. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution with perihilar haze and hazy alveolar infiltrates, left greater than right. It is unclear if an area of opacity in the right medial lower lung is an infiltrate or due to compressive changes. Overall, the appearance is that of worsened pulmonary edema. An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
