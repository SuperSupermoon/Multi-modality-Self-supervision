There are low lung volumes accounting for some bronchovascular crowding. Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis. No other focal opacities are seen. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is secondary to a prominent epicardial fat pad that is better seen in subsequent CT. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no evidence of abdominal free air. A tortuous aorta is present. The cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable.
