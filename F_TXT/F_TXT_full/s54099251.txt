Lines and tubes are grossly unchanged. The NG tube may extend slightly further. Multiple lines overlying the chest are likely EKG leads. Again seen are diffuse bilateral opacities. Hazy opacity at the bases could reflect effusions. Possible slight improvement in the upper zones compared with one day earlier. Overall, there has been interval obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm, which could reflect some interval right lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Otherwise, the overall appearance is similar.
