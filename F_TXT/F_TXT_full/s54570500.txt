There are diffuse alveolar opacities bilaterally with hazy lung bases, findings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema and probable bilateral pleural effusions. There is likely associated compressive atelectasis at the bases as well. No pneumothorax is evident. Mediastinal contours appear normal. Moderate cardiomegaly appears similar to prior. The bones remain diffusely osteopenic.
