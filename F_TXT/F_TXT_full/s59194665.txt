Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates very low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. New opacities are seen at the bilateral bases, left greater than right, and in the setting of very low lung volumes, may represent atelectasis, pneumonia, or a combination. Heart size is normal. There is no pneumothorax.
