Lordotic positioning. ET tube tip lies at the lower level the clavicular heads, approximately 7.2 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip over gastric fundus. A left sided Port-A-Cath tip overlies the right atrium. Multiple leads overlie the chest. Again seen are increased interstitial markings diffusely in both lungs and also confluent opacities, most pronounced in the right upper and right infrahilar regions and in the left mid zone and retrocardiac region. These are similar to the prior study. A right pleural effusion is slightly larger. The left effusion is similar to the prior study.
