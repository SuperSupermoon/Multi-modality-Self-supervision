The severe multi focal pneumonia which progressed from ___ through ___, had improved on ___. Subsequently the right upper lobe component has nearly resolved, and the right middle lobe and lower lobe components have continued to improve. There has also been a decrease in pulmonary vascular congestion which reflected borderline cardiac decompensation. Small right pleural effusion may be present, but is probably not clinically significant in and of itself. The only new development pertaining to worsening cough is obscuration of the descending thoracic aorta by region of new consolidation in the left lower lobe. Whether this is pneumonia or atelectasis is radiographically difficult to distinguish. Conventional radiographs, particularly supplemented by a oblique views would be very helpful.
