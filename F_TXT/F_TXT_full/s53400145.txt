Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube tip terminates just beyond the gastroesophageal junction, and should be advanced for optimal positioning. The heart size is top normal. Diffuse ill-defined alveolar opacities are noted, most predominantly in the perihilar regions, left lung more involved than the right. There is blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally, which may reflect small effusions. No pneumothorax identified. A large bulla appears to be present in the right lower lobe, and severe emphysematous changes are noted.
