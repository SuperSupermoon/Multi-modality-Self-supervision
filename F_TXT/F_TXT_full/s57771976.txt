As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left internal jugular vein catheter. The course of the catheter is unremarkable, the tip of the catheter projects over the mid to lower SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.
