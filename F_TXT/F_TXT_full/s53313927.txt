AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with a next preceding similar study of ___. There is further clearance of the previously described remaining bilateral basal densities that represented pleural effusions following an episode of CHF. The diaphragms are now visible but only remaining mild blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus. The right-sided pleural sinus is free. There is no evidence of new acute pulmonary infiltrates of pneumonic appearance. No pneumothorax is present in the apical area. A left-sided subclavian approach central venous line remains in unchanged position.
