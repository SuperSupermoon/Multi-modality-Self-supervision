Rotated positioning. An NG tube is present --___ tip extends beneath the diaphragm and overlies the expected site of the gastric fundus, beyond the GE junction. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No focal consolidation, overt CHF, or gross effusion is identified. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle cannot be entirely excluded. There is linear bibasilar linear atelectasis. The 2 mm nodule identified on the ___ chest CT in the right lower lobe is not definitively identified on this examination, presumably due to limitations of the modality. No free air seen beneath the diaphragms. Incidental note is made of osteopenia, scoliosis and degenerative change the thoracic and upper lumbar spine, with mild endplate scalloping of at least two mid thoracic vertebral bodies and of severe degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral joint.
