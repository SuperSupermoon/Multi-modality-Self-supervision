Lung volumes are low. There are bibasilar areas of subsegmental atelectasis. An enteric tube courses into the stomach and below the hemidiaphragm, its distal tip is not visualized. A left-sided PICC line terminates low in the right atrium. It may be withdrawn by 4 cm for more optimal positioning at the superior cavoatrial junction.
