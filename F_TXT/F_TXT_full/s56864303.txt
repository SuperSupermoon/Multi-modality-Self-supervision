There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Left lower lobe atelectatic changes are certainly present as well as elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to the prior study. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax and no evidence of infection. Epidural cathetars and a chest tube are in place. A small amount of subcutaneous air in the right neck and a possible tiny apical pneumothorax are also present.
