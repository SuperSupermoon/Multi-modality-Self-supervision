CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW Again seen is the left subclavian central line, tip in the region of the right atrium. Also again seen are low inspiratory volumes. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, likely accentuated by low lung volumes. There is also bibasilar atelectasis. More patchy opacities at the left lung base and right cardiophrenic region could represent areas of aspiration and/or early infectious infiltrate. Oral contrast in the splenic flexure remains visible. Compared with ___ at 19:31 p.m., the CHF findings are slightly more pronounced. The basilar opacities are similar to the prior film.
