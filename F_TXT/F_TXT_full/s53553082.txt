Assessment is somewhat limited by patient rotation. Left-sided pacemaker device is re- demonstrated with leads terminating in the regions of the right atrium and right ventricle. Previously noted marked diffuse dilatation of the esophagus may be somewhat improved, but not fully assessed on this single view. Marked enlargement of the right hilum as well as fullness of the right mediastinal contour reflects known lymphadenopathy, unchanged. Mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion is noted with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness. Opacification within the right lung base is worse compared to the previous radiograph, concerning for collapse. Known nodule within the right middle lobe is better assessed on the previous CT. There is a moderate size right pleural effusion. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is chronic. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
