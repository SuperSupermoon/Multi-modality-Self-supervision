In comparison with the study of ___, there again is increased opacification at the bases with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms and blunting the costophrenic angles, consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and underlying compressive atelectasis. Streaks of atelectasis are seen at the left base. Pacer device and right central catheter are unchanged. No evidence of mediastinal widening. There may be mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure without definite acute focal pneumonia.
