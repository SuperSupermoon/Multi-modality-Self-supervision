Portable frontal supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of an ET tube ending 3.3 cm above the carina. An enteric tube is seen passing just below the diaphragm. The side hole is not well visualized however it is likely within the esophagus. The right internal jugular central venous catheter is in unchanged position ending in the mid SVC. Lung volumes are lower. Otherwise, there is no significant change compared to 20 minutes prior.
