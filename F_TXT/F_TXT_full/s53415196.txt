There are markedly low inspiratory volumes. Prominence of cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular markings as well as patchy left greater than right base opacity is likely accentuated by the low inspiratory volumes, and makes it difficult to exclude underlying basilar infiltrate or CHF. No gross effusion is identified. No pneumothorax is detected.
