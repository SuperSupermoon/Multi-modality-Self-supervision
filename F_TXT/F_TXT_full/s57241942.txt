Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a right subclavian approach central venous catheter with tip in the lower SVC. There is no pneumothorax. A left pectoral cardiac pacer is stable in location with the leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. The lung volumes are low, accentuating mild pulmonary edema. There is retrocardiac opacity and blunting in the left costophrenic angle which may reflect atelectasis and a small effusion.
