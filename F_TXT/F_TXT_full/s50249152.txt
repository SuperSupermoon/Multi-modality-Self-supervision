AP chest compared to ___: Left hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated responsible for persistent severe left lower lobe atelectasis. Increasing opacification in the mid and lower lung zones since ___ could be worsening dependent edema, since there is substantial pulmonary vascular and mediastinal venous engorgement in the setting of severe chronic cardiomegaly, but pneumonia should also be considered, particularly aspiration. The bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
