Large pleural left-sided central venous catheter is again seen, grossly unchanged in position. A right-sided single lead pacemaker is also as stable in position. Left base opacity with obscuration of the diaphragm likely due to pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. Left base consolidation may also be present. There is also patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region although somewhat similar as compared the prior study and most likely represents overlap of vascular structures. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No pneumothorax is seen.
