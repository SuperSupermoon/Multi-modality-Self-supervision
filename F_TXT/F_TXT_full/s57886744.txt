Slightly low inspiratory volumes, with slight patient rotation. A Port-A-Cath type catheter is present. On today's exam, the tip overlies the proximal SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Linear density projecting over the cardiac silhouette to the right of midline appears to correspond to density seen on the ___ CT scan (02:58 from that exam) and may represent some postoperative material. Vague focal density along the right chest wall inferiorly appears represent changes around a possibly ununited fracture of the right (?) 5th rib. This appearance is seen on the ___ radiograph and is not thought to be acute. No CHF, focal infiltrate, consolidation, or effusion is identified.
