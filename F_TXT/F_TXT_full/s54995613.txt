The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, approximately 5.3 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of field of view. Since the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower. Mild pulmonary edema has worsened. There is persistent opacification of the left mid and lower lung zones, likely pneumonia or aspiration. There is no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
