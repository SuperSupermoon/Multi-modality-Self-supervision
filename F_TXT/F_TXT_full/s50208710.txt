ET tube in standard placement. Previous moderate pulmonary edema has improved, mild cardiomegaly is slightly smaller and mediastinal and pulmonary venous engorgement have improved. Large scale consolidation in the right lower lobe may be larger consistent with worsening pneumonia accompanied by larger moderate right pleural effusion. It is impossible to say whether opacification that persists at the base of the left lung is residual edema and atelectasis or a second focus of pneumonia. Right jugular line ends at or just below the superior cavoatrial junction and an esophageal tube passes into a non distended stomach and out of view. There is no pneumothorax.
