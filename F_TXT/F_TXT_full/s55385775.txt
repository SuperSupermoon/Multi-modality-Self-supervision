Mild pulmonary edema is improved, compared to 01:30. Consolidation in the left midlung, presumably pneumonia, is still present, hard to assess for change because of differences in patient positioning. Pleural effusions are small if any. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube in standard placement. Transesophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
