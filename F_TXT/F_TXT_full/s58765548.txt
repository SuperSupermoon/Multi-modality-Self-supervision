Right subclavian central venous catheter tip is malpositioned, coursing across the midline, and tip likely within the left subclavian vein. The endotracheal tube has been withdrawn, with tip now terminating approximately 5 cm from the carina. Enteric tube remains in unchanged position. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis, but aspiration is not excluded. No large pleural effusion is present. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
