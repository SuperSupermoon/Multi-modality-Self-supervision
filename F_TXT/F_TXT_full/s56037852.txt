Assessment is slightly limited due to patient rotation. A right subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates in the low SVC. The cardiac silhouette size is normal. The mediastinal contour is grossly unremarkable allowing for patient rotation. There is no pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in both lung bases are nonspecific, possibly atelectasis. Hazy opacity overlying the right apex may be due to external devices projecting over this area. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified. Vertebral cage device and fixation hardware are seen within the thoracolumbar junction.
