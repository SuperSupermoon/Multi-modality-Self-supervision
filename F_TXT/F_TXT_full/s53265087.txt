Severe bilateral pulmonary consolidation, sparing only the right upper lobe, has progressed on the left, and although stable on the right now suggests developing cavitation in severe pneumonia. The relatively rapid change in the left lung (and subsequent improvement on the subsequent chest radiograph 05:00 on ___, available the time of this review) suggest a component of either recent aspiration or asymmetric edema in the left lung. Right pleural effusion is likely, but not large. No left pleural abnormality or right pneumothorax. ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
