In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 0.5 cm above the carina. The opacification at the right base is more prominent and the right heart border is not well seen. This is consistent with worsening right basilar pneumonia. Retrocardiac opacification could represent atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting a second focus of pneumonia could be considered.
