As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a further mild increase in the otherwise extensive, diffuse and bilateral interstitial opacities. These opacities are accompanied by small bilateral pleural effusions and mild increase in diameters of the pulmonary vasculature. Overall, despite the normal size of the cardiac silhouette, the findings are still strongly suggestive of interstitial lung edema. No additional newly appeared parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
