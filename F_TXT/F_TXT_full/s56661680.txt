AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. In the interval since the prior study, there has been development of a very large left pneumothorax with collapse of the left lung. There may be slight tension component. The right lung is clear. No pleural effusion. The left cardiac border appears somewhat flattened, which may be due to tension.
