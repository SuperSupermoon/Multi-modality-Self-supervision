Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Given this, there appears to be mild central vascular pulmonary engorgement. Soft tissue overlying the lung base likely causes underpenetration. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.
