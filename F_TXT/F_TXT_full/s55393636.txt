Portable AP supine view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the most recent prior study. An endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the carina. A right-sided PICC line ends in the upper to mid superior vena cava. An upper enteric tube enters the stomach and exits off of the radiograph. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis have improved compared to the prior radiograph. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Heart and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
