As compared to the previous image, the right PICC line has been minimally pulled back. The tip now projects over the upper SVC, at the level of the confluence with the brachiocephalic vein. No evidence of complication. In the interval the patient has been extubated. The bilateral areas of atelectasis are unchanged. Mild cardiomegaly. No larger pleural effusion. No new parenchymal opacity.
