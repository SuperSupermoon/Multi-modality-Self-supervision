Mild pulmonary edema has improved. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Bilateral effusions left greater than right associated with adjacent atelectasis are grossly unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. There is no evident pneumothorax. Right lower lobe opacity is grossly unchanged could be part of the atelectasis and effusion but superimposed infection can't be excluded
