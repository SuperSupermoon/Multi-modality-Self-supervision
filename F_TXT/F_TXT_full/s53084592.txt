Study is limited due to poor inspiratory effort and patient rotation to the left. There is a central line on the right, the tip is in the right atrium. Tracheostomy tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina. There is no pneumothorax or CHF. There is no definite consolidation at the left base which is obscured by the heart due to rotation.
