There is a low position of the endotracheal tube, which is seen with its tip located only 11 mm above the carina. Retraction by at least 2 cm would result in a more optimal position. The NG tube tracks into the left upper quadrant. There is hilar vascular engorgement and mild pulmonary edema. Lung volumes limit evaluation. The heart is mildly enlarged. No pneumothorax or large effusion. Bony structures are intact.
