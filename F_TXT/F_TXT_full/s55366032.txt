Interval removal of one of the two right-sided chest tubes with the remaining tube having its tip near the right lung apex unchanged in position. There is possibly a tiny right apical pneumothorax. There continue to be bilateral layering effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace disease, likely representing compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There has been interval improvement in the mild edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given differences in patient positioning.
