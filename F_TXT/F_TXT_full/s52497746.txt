Pulmonary edema developed between ___ and ___. Edema has subsequently cleared from the upper lungs, but there is still substantial consolidation in the lower lungs, particularly the left accompanied by at least small bilateral pleural effusions. To what extent the abnormality represents combination of edema and residual atelectasis or pneumonia, is radiographically indeterminate, but if the patient's respiratory status has recently declined that cannot be attributed to worsening edema; either atelectasis or pneumonia is more likely. Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Left PIC line ends in the low SVC.
