The mediastinum takes on a globular shape and the cardiac sized is increased. Increased peripheral markings are consistent with edema versus low lung volumes. The left lower hemithorax is completely opacified, likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion. Certainly, pneumonia could also be considered in this area, although air bronchograms are not present. There is no pneumothorax. Old right sided rib fractures and chronic degenerative changes of both shoulders are present.
