Single portable chest radiograph was provided. ET tube is above the clavicles, approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. NG tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach. New right IJ sheath is seen with the tip at the cavoatrial junction. Mild prominence of pulmonary vasculature is compatible with mild pulmonary edema. There is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and blunting of the costophrenic angle which may be due to small pleural effusion with atelectasis or infection. Osseous structures are intact.
