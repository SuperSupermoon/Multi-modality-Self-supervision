A right pigtail catheter is in stable position, and no pneumothorax is noted. There is a small right pleural effusion. Increased opacity at the right lung base likely reflects atelectasis given decreased lung volume compared to prior radiograph. A right central venous line terminates within the mid atrium. A nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm outside of the view of this radiograph. No new focal consolidation.
