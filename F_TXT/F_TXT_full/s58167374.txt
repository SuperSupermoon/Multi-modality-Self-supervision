Low lung volumes are present. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely top-normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion is present. No pneumothorax or overt pulmonary vascular congestion is present. An inferior vena cava filter is detected. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
