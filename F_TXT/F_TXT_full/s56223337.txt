Again seen is a right IJ central line with the tip at cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax detected. Inspiratory volumes are slightly lower. Allowing for technical differences, the enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. Sternotomy wires again noted. There is interval increase in retrocardiac density, likely reflecting a combination of layering pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. The right hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle are also slightly less well defined. CHF with interstitial and question early alveolar edema is similar, possibly slightly worse.
