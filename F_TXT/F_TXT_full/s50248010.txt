As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing parenchymal opacities on the right have substantially improved, but are still visible. On the left, the opacities have slightly improved, severe in their overall extent and severity. The retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged. Also unchanged is blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, likely caused by a small pleural effusion. In the interval, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. A right internal jugular vein catheter is in unchanged position.
