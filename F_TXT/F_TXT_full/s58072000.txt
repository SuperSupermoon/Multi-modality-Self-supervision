Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 3:30 p.m. and 2:51 p.m. The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina. The right chest tube is in place, but note is made that the side hole is borderline just at the edge of the thoracic cage. Substantial pneumothorax is noted on the right, unchanged as well as potentially present pneumopericardium. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right lung opacification appears to be slightly worse as compared to prior studies and there is also substantial interval increase in subcutaneous air in the right hemithorax.
