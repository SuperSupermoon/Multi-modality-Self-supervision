A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear stable. There is mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Streaky left basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis. However, an entirely new focal opacity projecting over the right mid lung raises suspicion for pneumonia. There is no free air.
