The heart is normal in size. The patient is status post gastric pull-up with parenchymal opacification demonstrated over the lower mediastinal contour on the right, as before. There are diffuse reticular, interstitial opacities, particularly at the left base which likely reflect edema. There is some increased perihilar fullness, particularly on the left which is consistent with volume overload.
