Overyling material limits evaluation to some degree. Lungs are low in volume with mild apical scarringand increased interstitial markings suggesting preexisting interstitial lung disease. No definite effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The heart is likely top normal. Irregularity of T10 and T11 on the frontal projection is compatible with the fracture seen on the outside imaging.
