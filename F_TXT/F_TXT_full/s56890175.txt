Lung volumes are low. There is moderate cardiomegaly which is relatively unchanged. The aorta is mildly tortuous and diffusely calcified. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis. There is mild attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices suggests underlying emphysema. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, with chronic mild pleural thickening at the right costophrenic angle likely indicative of pleural thickening.
