Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a right pleural tube and reexpansion of the right lung with resolution of pneumothorax, only a very small apical pneumothorax remains. There is no right pleural effusion. The ET tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the level of the carina. Right subclavian line is in standard position, terminating in the upper SVC. Remaining monitoring and support devices are unchanged in position compared to prior study. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged from prior study.
