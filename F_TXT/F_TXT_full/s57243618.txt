Bibasilar linear opacities favor scarring, post inflammatory change, or atelectasis especially as the right hemidiaphragm is tented and elevated consistent with volume loss. No developing focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia, although outside CT dated ___ does demonstrate patchy areas of ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe and a more consolidative process in the right posterior medial lower lobe which was felt to represent atelectasis, neither of which were well seen on plain radiography. There is a right lateral and basilar pleural effusion which is unchanged. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
