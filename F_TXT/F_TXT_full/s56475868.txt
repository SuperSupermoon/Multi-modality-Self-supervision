Compared to the prior study, _____ IJ central line is in place. The tip overlies the proximal SVC. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen are dense bilateral patchy opacities, more extensive on the right side. Left-sided pacemaker and right-sided PICC line again noted. Small densities in the right _____ quadrant of the abdomen again noted, not fully characterized.
