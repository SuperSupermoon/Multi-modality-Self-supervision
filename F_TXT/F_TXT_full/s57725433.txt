In comparison to the most recent prior study, there are no new changes noted. The heart is enlarged, the bibasilar plate-like atelectasis are unchanged; a dense region of linear opacity in the left midlung consistent with post biopsy bleeding and/or edema is unchanged. The Port-A-Cath tip is in stable position. No pneumothorax seen.
