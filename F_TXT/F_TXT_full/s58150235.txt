AP portable upright view of the chest. Lung volumes are markedly low limiting assessment. There is a retrocardiac opacity containing an air-fluid level compatible with a large hiatal hernia. There is subtle left lower lung hazy opacity which is potentially concerning for pneumonia or aspiration. The right lung appears relatively clear. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Heart size is difficult to assess. Mediastinal contour appears prominent likely due to technique. No acute bony abnormality seen.
