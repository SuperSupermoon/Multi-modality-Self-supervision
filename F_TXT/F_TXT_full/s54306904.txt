In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been removed. The IJ and nasogastric tube remain in place. Continued opacification at the left base, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. Less prominent changes are seen at the right base. Although not well seen, there is again suggestion of increased lucency beneath the right hemidiaphragm, consistent with residual free intraperitoneal gas related to a recent surgery.
