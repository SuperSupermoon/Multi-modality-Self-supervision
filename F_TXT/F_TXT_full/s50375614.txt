1. There continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral chest wall and neck soft tissues. No pneumothorax is appreciated. There are small bilateral effusions with associated patchy airspace disease at both bases, left greater than right, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Left shoulder replacement is again partially visualized.
