Interval placement of left-sided pigtail pleural catheter, with marked improvement in left pleural effusion, with a small residual effusion remaining. No visceral pleural line is identified at the apex, but the left hemidiaphragm appears unusually sharp suggesting a probable small basilar pneumothorax. Elliptical opacity adjacent to the pigtail pleural catheter corresponds to residual loculated pleural fluid posterolaterally as shown on prior CT. On the right, pigtail pleural catheter has slightly changed in orientation. A horizontal interface in the lower right hemithorax suggests a loculated hydropneumothorax. Right pleural effusion has slightly increased in size and is likely moderate in size based on apparent partial layering and small loculated components laterally and intrafissurally. Interval decrease in interstitial edema and improved atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region but slight worsening atelectasis at the right base.
