There are slightly low inspiratory volumes. There is moderately severe enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Allowing for differences in technique, this is fairly similar to ___. As before, there is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, which could reflect some mild interstitial edema. There has been some clearing of patchy retrocardiac density, with minimal residual opacity seen there. No gross effusion identified. Extent of any pericardial effusion cannot be assessed on these views.
