A nasogastric tube cannot be followed but presumably ends in the stomach. A left pectoral pacer defibrillator has leads ending in the right atrium. A right internal jugular line ends in the cavoatrial junction. A right subclavian Port-A-Cath ends in the mid SVC. Multiple other wires are presumably external. Compared to the prior chest radiograph of ___ the heart size has markedly increased and is now moderately to severely enlarged. Pulmonary vascular congestion and perihilar interstitial opacities consistent with moderate pulmonary edema are stable. There are no large pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
