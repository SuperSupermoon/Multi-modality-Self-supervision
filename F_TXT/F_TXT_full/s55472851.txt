Left lung has progressed to complete complete opacification consistent with collapse. Trachea is deviated to the left consistent with volume loss. The left bronchus also appears to have secretions within it, likely clot causing this atelectasis. ET tube is approximately 5 cm from the carina. Right IJ terminates likely in the low SVC. The right lung is essentially clear.
