As compared to the previous radiograph, there is better visibility of the subdiaphragmatic areas. A slightly hyperinflated colonic loop is seen at the level of the right upper quadrant. However, there is no evidence of free intra-abdominal air on the current radiograph. If the clinical presentation persists, however, an alternative imaging technique with higher sensitivity such as an abdominal radiograph or a CT should be considered. The lung volumes remain low. Moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.
