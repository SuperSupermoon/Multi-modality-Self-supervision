CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. Compared to ___, the appearance is quite similar. Again seen is opacity at the right base, in addition to an elevated right hemidiaphragm. This appears to reflect an element of collapse/consolidation and small effusion. There is also increased opacity at the left base. No gross left effusion. Allowing for slightly low volumes, doubt overt CHF. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. There has been interval removal of the right IJ line. No pneumothorax is detected.
