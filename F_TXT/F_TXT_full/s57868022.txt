Subtle lucency within the left lung base with deep sulcus sign corresponds to the pneumothorax better seen on the previous chest CT. Numerous anterior bilateral rib fractures are also better appreciated on the prior CT. There has been no interval change in the cardiac or mediastinal contour, and no rightward shift of midline structures is appreciated. The endotracheal tube has been withdrawn and now terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina. There has been interval placement of an enteric tube with tip at the gastroesophageal junction. Left-sided pacemaker device is again noted. Lung volumes remain low with crowding of bronchovascular structures. Patchy opacities within the lung bases likely reflect a combination of atelectasis and aspiration.
