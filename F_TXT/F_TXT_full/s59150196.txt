1. Interval removal of the right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with the introducer remaining in place with its tip in the proximal SVC. Overall, the cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in this patient status post median sternotomy with mitral valve replacement. There is increasing consolidation in the left lung base with an associated pleural effusion which has also increased. These findings are most consistent with partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia should also be considered. There is also a layering right effusion. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax.
