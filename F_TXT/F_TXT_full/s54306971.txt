Cardiac silhouette size appears mildly enlarged. Lung volumes are low. Aorta remains tortuous. Hilar contours are relatively unchanged. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures as result of low lung volumes, without definite evidence for overt pulmonary edema. Bibasilar airspace opacities are noted, more pronounced in the retrocardiac region, findings which could reflect atelectasis, but infection or aspiration is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. The right costophrenic angle is excluded from the examination. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified allowing for this.
