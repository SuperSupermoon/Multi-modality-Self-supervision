There is mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette which is unchanged. There is mild perihilar haziness and cephalization of the pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion, similar compared to the previous exam. Patchy retrocardiac opacity most likely reflects atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
