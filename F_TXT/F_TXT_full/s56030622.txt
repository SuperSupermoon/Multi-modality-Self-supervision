There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube. This has significantly reduced in the right pleural effusion with only a tiny residual effusion seen. Improved aeration of the right lung base. No pneumothorax seen. A left-sided PICC has been repositioned and now terminates in the mid to distal SVC. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. A nasoenteric tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm, the tip is not visualized.
