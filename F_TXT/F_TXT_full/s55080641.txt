Single AP upright view of the chest demonstrates a very small right apicolateral pneumothorax. There has been interval placement of a right pleural catheter with distal tip projecting adjacent to the right heart border and interval improvement in the right-sided pleural effusion. The previously seen left apical mass with bony destruction of the left second and third ribs is again seen.
