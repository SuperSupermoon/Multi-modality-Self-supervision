Single supine semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 3.7 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not well seen on the image. There are severe bilateral perihilar opacities consistent with severe pulmonary edema as well as bilateral pleural effusions. There is widening of the superior mediastinum which may be accentuated by AP, semi-erect portable technique, although if there is concern for mediastinal injury, chest CTA is more sensitive. Cardiac silhouette is top normal.
