Comparison is made to the previous CT of the abdomen from ___. The tip of the endotracheal tube is within the trachea, 4 cm above the carina. It is slightly deviated to the left due to the enlarged aortic knob. There is a large amount of air seen projecting over the lower heart border. This is presumably related to pneumomediastinum from the surgery. The nasogastric tube tip is at the GE junction and this could be advanced several centimeters for more optimal placement. There are again seen bibasilar opacities abutting air-filled mediastinum. There is a faint right upper lobe opacification suggestive of asymmetric pulmonary edema or atelectasis. Subcutaneous gas within the lower neck soft tissues, right greater than left is present. These findings have been discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___.
