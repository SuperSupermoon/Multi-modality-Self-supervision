1. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. An endotracheal tube remains in place with the tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.

The lungs are otherwise clear. No pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax is appreciated. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
