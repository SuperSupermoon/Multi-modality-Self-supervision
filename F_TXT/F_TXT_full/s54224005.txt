The patient's overlying chin obscures the lung apices. There are low lung volumes. Blunting of the right greater than left costophrenic angles are seen which may be due to trace pleural effusions. Difficult to exclude consolidation at the lateral left lung base. No definite consolidation seen elsewhere. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
