Compared to chest radiograph from a few hours earlier, there is little overall change. Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Mediastinal veins are mildly dilated but there is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion. Stable left lower lobe atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Right lung is clear. Left chest tube crosses to the midline and impinges on the mediastinum.
