In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change in the severe narrowing in deviation of the trachea to the right by a large mediastinal mass. The stent there is extremely difficult to detect on plain radiography, though appears to have its upper border at the lower margin of the right clavicle and extends to close to the lower margin of the transverse arch of the aorta. Otherwise little change.
