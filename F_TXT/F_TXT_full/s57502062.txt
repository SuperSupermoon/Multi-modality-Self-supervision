Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. Heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. The right lung is essentially clear. There is interval improvement in the left mid and lower lung consolidation, most likely consistent with partial resolution of aspiration.
