Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Right lower lobe consolidation has slightly improved, but a nonspecific opacity in the left retrocardiac region has worsened. Considering inferior displacement of left hilum, this is probably due to atelectasis, but aspiration and developing pneumonia are also possible. Additionally, there is a probable small left pleural effusion, but no visible pneumothorax.
