The endotracheal tube terminates 5.7 cm above the carina. A right IJ catheter terminates at the mid to lower SVC. There is mild pulmonary edema. The opacity at the right lung base appears to be improving compared to prior studies likely resolving atelectasis. Opacification of the left lung base is likely due to the small pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Since the prior radiograph performed 2 days earlier, there has been interval enlargement in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
