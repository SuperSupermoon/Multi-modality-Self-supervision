Lung volumes are appreciably lower. Heterogeneous opacification now increasing in the right perihilar distribution is, given the preceding mediastinal vascular distention, probably pulmonary edema but needs to be followed carefully to exclude pneumonia, particularly with worsening bilateral infrahilar consolidation more commonly due to postoperative atelectasis. Poor definition of the left bronchial airway suggests retained secretions which could be a cause of both atelectasis and pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions are larger. There is no pneumothorax. Heart is mildly enlarged. ET tube is in standard placement. Right internal jugular line ends close to if not slightly beyond the superior cavoatrial junction. After insertion of a new nasogastric tube, gastric distention has decreased.
