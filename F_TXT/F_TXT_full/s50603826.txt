The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The left-sided AICD device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Left PICC tip as well as a right-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the low SVC. Moderate cardiomegaly is again demonstrated, unchanged. There is persistent mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No large pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. Persistent right basilar patchy opacity reflects known improving pneumonia, better assessed on recent CT. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
