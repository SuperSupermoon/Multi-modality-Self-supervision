There relatively low lung volumes. No focal consolidation is seen. Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature may relate to low lung volumes and/or pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. The mediastinum appears widened but this may relate to low lung volume and possible mediastinal lipomatosis.
