New NG tube has been placed with tip ending in the pyloric region. Lung volume is moderate with small linear opacity at the left lung base compatible with atelectasis. Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus can be due to a small pleural effusion. Lungs are otherwise clear. Heart size is top normal. There is no pneumothorax.
