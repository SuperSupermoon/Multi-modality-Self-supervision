As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices, including the catheter inserted over the inferior vena cava, are unchanged. The lung volumes remain low. There is moderate cardiomegaly with relatively extensive bilateral areas of atelectasis, a left pleural effusion and minimal fluid overload. The overall transparency of the lung parenchyma is increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. No new parenchymal opacities. No evidence of newly appeared pneumonia.
