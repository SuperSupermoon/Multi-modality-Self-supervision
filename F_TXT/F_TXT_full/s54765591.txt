Portable AP view of the chest demonstrates confluent opacity in the right mid and lower lung. There is relative sparing of the right apex. Rounded lucencies projecting over right hemithorax, are suggestive of cavities or abscess formation. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is likely. Ground-glass opacities most pronounced in the left mid lung zone. There is no large left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Heart size is difficult to discern due to adjacent opacities. Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
