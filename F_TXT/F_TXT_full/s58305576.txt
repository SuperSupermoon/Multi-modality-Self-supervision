As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared extensive parenchymal opacity in the right lung. The morphology of the opacity and the time course suggest pulmonary edema. The edema could be the consequence of re-expansion after drainage of a right effusion. On the left, the effusion is constant. No evidence of pneumothorax. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged course of the pacemaker leads.
