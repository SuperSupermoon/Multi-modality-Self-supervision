The lung volumes are low. Allowing for differences in technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are probably unchanged. There is similar mild relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to the right. Although there are patchy opacities at the left lung base, these are not probably out of proportion to what could be expected with post-operative volume loss. It is difficult to exclude pleural effusions, particularly on the left. There is no pneumothorax.
