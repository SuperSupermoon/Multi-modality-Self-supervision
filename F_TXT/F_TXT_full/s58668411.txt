In comparison to ___ radiograph, an intra-aortic balloon pump has been introduced, with tip of the device at the expected location of the superior aspect of the aortic knob. A Swan-Ganz catheter has also been introduced, terminating in the right ventricular outflow tract. Cardiomediastinal contours have decreased in width with associated improvement in extent of pulmonary edema. An exception is an enlarging confluent airspace opacity in the right lower lung which could reflect asymmetrical edema or secondary process such as aspiration or infectious pneumonia.
