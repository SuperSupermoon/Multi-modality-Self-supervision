A new endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube courses through the stomach and inferiorly beyond the film. Moderate left and small right layering pleural effusions are unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly and central venous congestion persist. There has been slight improvement in moderate interstitial and airspace pulmonary opacities. Persistent retrocardiac opacity could represent atelectasis or consolidation.
