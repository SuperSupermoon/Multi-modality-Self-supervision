There is widespread bilateral airspace opacity, with normal lung volumes. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, with a probable loculated effusion resulting in well defined right lower lobe opacity. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, in this patient with changes of median sternotomy and CABG. There is no pneumothorax.
