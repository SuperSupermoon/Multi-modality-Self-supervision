Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature. In the right infrahilar region, new since the prior examination, is an opacity, which in the appropriate clinical context, may represent pneumonia. Vague left basilar opacity is also noted. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
