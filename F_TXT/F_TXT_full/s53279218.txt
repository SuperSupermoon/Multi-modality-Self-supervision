Compared with ___ at 09:20, the overall appearance is similar. The patchy focal opacity at the right lung base may be very slightly more confluent and dense, but this may also be accounted for by differences in positioning. Small left effusion and left base atelectasis is again noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and mild upper zone redistribution is probably unchanged. Oro gastric type tube and left subclavian PICC line again noted. No definite pneumothorax, though due to rotated positioning, a tiny pneumothorax in the right upper zone might not be apparent.
