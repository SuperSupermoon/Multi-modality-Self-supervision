In comparison with the study of ___, there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some tortuosity of the aorta. There is increased opacification at the left base, consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. Probably mild atelectatic changes at the right base. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Left subclavian PICC line extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
