The appearance in the right lung has worsened with increased right lower lobe infiltrate and increased nodular opacities. Some of these may be true nodules, or infection or neoplasm. There is also increased effusion on the right .the left lung is relatively clear. the heart is slightly enlarged. There is ill definition of the mediastinum suggesting vascular engorgement although given history lymphadenopathy could also be contributing to this appearance.
