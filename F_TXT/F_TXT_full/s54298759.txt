As compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, there has been interval placement of an NG tube with its tip terminating at the gastric fundus, and the sideport seen below the GE junction. Endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina and ___ tube has been removed. There has been interval increase of vascular congestion and there is blunting of the left hemidiaphragm which is likely related to atelectasis. Most likely, there are small bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are within normal limits.
