As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone thoracocentesis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Bilaterally, the pleural effusions that pre existed have substantially decreased in extent. Areas of mild atelectasis are still visualized at the lung bases. The nasogastric tube was removed. Mild cardiomegaly persists.
