Multiple lines and tubes are similar to the prior film. Allowing for changes in the patient position, the left mediastinal border is better defined, but no definite change in the cardio mediastinal silhouette is identified. Renewed visualization of left hemidiaphragm suggests an element of clearing at the left lung base. Slight interval clearing of opacity in the upper zones may also have occurred. Nonetheless, again seen is diffuse opacity in both lungs, compatible with pulmonary edema. No gross effusion is identified. Residual consolidation in the left lower lobe is indicated by air bronchograms projecting over the retrocardiac region. No gross effusions identified. No pneumothorax detected.
