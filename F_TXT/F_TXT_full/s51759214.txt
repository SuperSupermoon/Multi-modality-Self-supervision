There has been interval removal of a right pigtail thoracostomy tube. A right IJ catheter, endotracheal tube, and orogastric tube are unchanged in position. There is no pneumothorax. The heart is mildly enlarged. A persistent left retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis, though underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion appears improved.
