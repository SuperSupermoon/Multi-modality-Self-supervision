There has been interval decrease in size of large left pleural effusion. Status post thoracentesis. No pneumothorax is identified. The right hemi thorax remains grossly clear, and there is persistent obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and left heart border, likely due to atelectasis and some remaining pleural effusion.
