As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. There is unchanged evidence of moderate bilateral pleural effusions with subsequent moderate areas of atelectasis at both lung bases. No pneumothorax. The presence of coexisting disease in the atelectatic lung portions cannot be excluded. The borders of the cardiac silhouette cannot be exactly determined.
