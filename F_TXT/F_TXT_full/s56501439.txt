Portable chest radiograph demonstrates new consolidaiton in the left lowre lung, likely pneumonia. Right lower lung opacification may be atelectasis exaggerated by low lung volumes, alternatively representing a multifocal bilateral pneumonia is a consideration. Cardiac silhouette is somewhat obscured by opacification, but appears normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. No pneumothorax evident. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may represent a small pleural effusion. Posterior spinal fusion hardware identified. Tip of a right-sided central venous catheter is obscured but is seen as far as the cavoatrial junction. IMPRESSION:Left lower and possibly right lower lung pneumonia. Tip of right-sided central venous catheter obscured but seen as far as cavoatrial junction.
