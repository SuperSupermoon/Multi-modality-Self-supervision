Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently 05:58 today. This radiograph was performed at my request, with attention to reducing skin folds. There is no confusing skin fold projecting over the right hemi thorax any longer and no evidence of pneumothorax on that side. On the left there is a different array of skin folds. If there is any pneumothorax it is quite small. There is no pleural effusion. Lungs are grossly clear. Heart is mildly enlarged. No pulmonary edema. ET tube is in standard placement. Nasogastric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach.
