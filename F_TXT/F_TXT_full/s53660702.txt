The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right subclavian PICC line are likely unchanged in position given differences in patient rotation. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. There are layering bilateral effusions, left greater than right. More focal opacity in the right mid-to-lower lung may represent loculated fluid, pneumonia or atelectasis. Improved aeration of the right lung apex. Lungs are hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema. No pneumothorax.
