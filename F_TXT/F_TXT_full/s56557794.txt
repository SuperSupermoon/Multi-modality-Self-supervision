Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates overall interval improvement in right lower lobe opacity since the prior study, although a right infrahilar opacity remains. An endotracheal tube remains in appropriate position, terminating 5.4 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. A small left pleural effusion is stable.
