The endotracheal tube tip seats 4.5 cm above the carina. A right-sided PICC tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction. An endogastric tube courses inferiorly and out of the field of view. An IVC filter is present. The heart size is within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear normal. The lungs continue to demonstrate an ill-defined opacity behind the heart which does not appear to obscure the hemidiaphragm. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
