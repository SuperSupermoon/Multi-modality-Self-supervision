Right internal jugular vascular catheter continues to terminate in the proximal right atrium. Small right apical pneumothorax is present and is likely unchanged allowing for positional differences between the studies. Moderate right pleural effusion and adjacent opacities in the right mid and lower lung regions also appear unchanged. Remainder of the exam is similar to prior study performed less than one hour previous.
