A moderate to large right pleural effusion layers on the current exam which accounts for the hazy opacity overlying the right upper and mid lung fields. Small left pleural effusion is relatively unchanged. Assessment of the cardiac silhouette size is difficult given the presence of bilateral pleural effusions. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. No pulmonary edema is visualized. Bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified.
