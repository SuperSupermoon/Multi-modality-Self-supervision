Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left, has improved. Upper lungs grossly clear. There is probably a component of atelectasis, particular in the left lower lobe but that has improved as well. Cardiac silhouette is obscured, but probably not enlarged. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. There is no pneumothorax.
