Median sternotomy wires are again noted. There has been interval removal of a right PICC line. Mediastinal contours are stable, and heart size is normal. Again seen is opacification of the left lower lung, representing a combination of elevated left hemidiaphragm, atelectasis, and small effusion. Otherwise, diffuse patchy opacities throughout the lung fields have improved.
