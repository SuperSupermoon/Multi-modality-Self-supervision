ET tube in standard placement. Right PIC line ends in the upper SVC. Nasogastric tube is coiled in the moderately distended stomach. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and severe bibasilar consolidation, pneumonia and probably atelectasis as well, have not changed appreciably since earlier in the day, given the improvement due to intubation. No pneumothorax. Heart size normal. Upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is normal. I do not believe any pulmonary edema is present.
