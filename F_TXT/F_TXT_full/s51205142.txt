Semi-upright portable chest radiograph excludes the left hemidiaphragm, limiting evaluation. There is bibasilar opacity, new compared with the prior study. The cardiac silhouette is normal. The mediastinum appears widened, which may be due to portable technique, with unfolding of the thoracic aorta. No pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
