Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.5 cm from the carina. The heart is mildly enlarged. Calcification of the aortic knob is present. Lungs appear hyperinflated, suggestive of underlying COPD. Increased interstitial markings with indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature suggests mild pulmonary edema. Dense opacity within the retrocardiac region may reflect infection or aspiration, with atelectasis also in the differential. Scattered ill-defined nodular opacities within the right mid lung field are also noted. Bilateral pleural effusions are present, small to moderate in size on the left and trace on the right. No pneumothorax is identified. The hila are mildly prominent. Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the imaged spine with osteophytic spurring. No pneumothorax is identified. Chain sutures are seen projecting over the left lung apex.
