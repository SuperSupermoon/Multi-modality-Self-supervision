The tip of the nasogastric tube projects over the distal esophagus and should be advanced by at least 13 cm in order to place the side port beyond the GE junction.

A partially visualized left nephroureteric stent is present. New layering left pleural effusion with subjacent atelectasis/consolidation. Otherwise the visualized lung parenchyma is grossly unchanged. The size of the cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.
