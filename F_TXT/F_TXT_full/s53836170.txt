AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Severe widespread pulmonary consolidation worsened dramatically between ___ and ___, initially in the right upper and lower lobes, and then between ___ and ___ throughout both lungs accompanied by an increase in previously moderate left and small right pleural effusions. There has not been any improvement since ___. Right pleural effusion is moderate, left is severe. A severe cardiomegaly which is chronic has worsened, but whether this is due to cardiomegaly alone or in combination with pericardial effusion is indeterminate on conventional chest radiographs. Of note, the tracheostomy tube is smaller than expected given the diameter of the trachea. Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC, transvenous right ventricular and left ventricular leads are in standard placements. Overall, the sequence suggests severe right-sided pneumonia followed by severe pulmonary edema and large bilateral pleural effusions.
