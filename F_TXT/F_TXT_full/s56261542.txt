Right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, endotracheal tube, and mediastinal and chest tubes are unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG with expected postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. Interval improvement in aeration of the left lung but persistent mild to moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema. Layering left effusion with more focal patchy airspace disease at the left base favoring atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. No obvious pneumothorax.
