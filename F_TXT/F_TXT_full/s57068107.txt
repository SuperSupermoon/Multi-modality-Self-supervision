A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There is a marked increase in hazy opacification of each lung, suggesting pulmonary edema in addition to layering pleural effusions, probably at least moderate in size on the right and also likely substantial on the left. Retrocardiac opacification is not specific, but would commonly be due to atelectasis.
