The tip of the nasogastric tube is in the upper stomach, with the side port just distal to the esophagogastric junction. Hazy opacification at the bases is consistent with layering effusions and compressive atelectasis. Continued elevated pulmonary venous pressure in a patient with previous midline wires, the top to of which are broken.
