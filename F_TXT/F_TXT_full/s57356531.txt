AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. As seen on prior CT, patient is known to have interstitial fibrosis with subpleural fibrosis likely accounting for the increased reticular opacities seen peripherally on the chest radiograph. There is atelectasis versus scarring at the left lung base which appears stable from prior exam. There is no definite sign of a superimposed pneumonia. No pleural effusion is seen. No pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinum appears stable. Bony structures appear intact. Relative deformity of the right distal clavicle likely reflects an old injury.
