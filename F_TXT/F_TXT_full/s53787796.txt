As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved transparency at the left and right lung base, likely reflecting improved ventilation. The pre-existing opacities have substantially decreased in severity. However, there is unchanged evidence of moderate cardiomegaly. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities. Minimal fluid overload without overt pulmonary edema.
