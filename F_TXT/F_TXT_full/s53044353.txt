Portable chest radiograph demonstrates worsened right lung pulmnonary edema with more confluent opacification in the right lower lung which may represent combination of increasing atelectasis and worsening edema or possible central hematoma. Stable rightward shift of widened mediastinum, an expected posturgical finding. Possible small right pleural effusion is unchanged. No left pleural effusion. Right-sided chest tube is stable in position. No pneumothorax. Minimally decreased subcutaneous emphysema evident.
