CHEST, SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW. Lordotic rotated positioning. The patient is status post sternotomy, with mediastinal clips and a prosthetic valve. There is borderline cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration. There is increased retrocardiac opacity with minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle, which could reflect left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. If clinically indicated, a lateral view may help for further assessment. There is atelectasis at the right lung base, with minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Doubt CHF. Possible background COPD. Rounded density at the right lung base may represent a nipple shadow and is not visible on the two prior films. Incidental note is made of narrowing of the right shoulder acromiohumeral distance, consistent with a chronic rotator cuff tear.
