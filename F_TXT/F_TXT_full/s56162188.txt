As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone aortic repair. In the interval, the left subclavian catheter has been removed, the other monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The size of the cardiac silhouette is slightly larger than on the previous film. There is increased fullness of the aortopulmonary window that should receive attention on followup radiographs. As on the previous image, the presence of small pleural effusion cannot be excluded. There is moderate pulmonary edema and relatively extensive bilateral basal atelectasis. No pneumothorax is appreciated on the current image.
