There continues to be a layering left effusion with associated airspace opacity which likely reflects atelectasis. There is likely a smaller right effusion with linear and patchy opacities at the base also suggestive of atelectasis. Possible minimal to mild interstitial edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable although difficult to assess due to the patient rotation on the current study. No pneumothorax.
