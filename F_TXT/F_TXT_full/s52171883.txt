Aeration of the lungs has improved compared to the previous exam, but lung volumes remain low. Given the lower lung volumes on the prior exam with vascular crowding, there is minimal interval change. The heart is normal in size. Pleural effusion on the left, if any, is small and decreased from the prior exam. Appearance of the mediastinum is unchanged. The right Port-A-Cath position unchanged with its tip ending in the junction of the upper SVC internal jugular vein. No pneumothorax.
