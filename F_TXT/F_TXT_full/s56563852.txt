Inspiratory volumes are low. Compared 1 day earlier, there is a relatively large area of alveolar opacity with air bronchograms in the left upper/mid zone, compatible with focal consolidation. There is sparing of the left lung apex and left base. No left-sided effusion. Heart size is borderline, probably unchanged. Again seen is mild patchy opacity at the right base, subtle prominence of super right suprahilar markings all and a small right effusion. Right IJ central line again noted with tip over right upper right atrium. No pneumothorax detected. Slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted, slightly more pronounced on the current study. Line/drains again noted in the abdomen, similar in configuration.
