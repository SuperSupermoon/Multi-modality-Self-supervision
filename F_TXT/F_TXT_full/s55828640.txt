The patient is intubated. An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged including widening of the mediastinum and substantial cardiomegaly. Mild perhilar congestion appears unchanged. There are possibly small pleural effusions and the base of the chest is difficult to assess owing to cardiomegaly and soft tissue attenuation. There has been no significant change aside from endotracheal intubation.
