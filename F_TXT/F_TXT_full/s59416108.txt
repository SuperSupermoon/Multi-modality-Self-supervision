No previous chest x-rays on PACS record for comparison. The heart is not enlarged. There is no CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion. I suspect the presence of some bullous change at the lung apices. However, no fibronodular scarring or apical retraction is identified. Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary nodules, or calcified lymph nodes are detected. Osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.
