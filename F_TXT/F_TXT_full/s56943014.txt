Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Mediastinal contour appears similar. Low lung volumes result in crowding of bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present. No subdiaphragmatic free air is present. Clips are noted in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
