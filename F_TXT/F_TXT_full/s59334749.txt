Interval placement a right pigtail catheter projecting over the right lower hemithorax and a left pigtail catheter projecting over the left lower hemithorax. Bilateral small pleural effusions, greater on the left, are new. Small left apical pneumothorax (approximately 1.5 cm) and tiny right apical pneumothorax are new. No evidence of tension. Lung volumes remain low, with probable reduced aeration of the lungs compared to the prior exam. The heart is normal in size. Increased interstitial markings bilaterally likely reflect mild edema, overall similar to the prior exam. Right PICC line ends in the low SVC. Enteric feeding tube traverses the diaphragm and ends in the stomach. Median sternotomy wires appear intact and unchanged. Replaced valve is intact.
