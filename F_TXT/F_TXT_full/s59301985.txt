Single AP portable chest radiograph is obtained. Tracheostomy tube is present. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is a hazy veil-like opacity in the right upper lung zone which may be consolidation, atelectasis or artifact. Heart size appears enlarged; however, this may be technical due to AP view. Bony structures are intact.
