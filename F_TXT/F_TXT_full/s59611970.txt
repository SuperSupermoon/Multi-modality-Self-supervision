Patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and mitral valve replacement. Heart size remains enlarged, similar to the prior study. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution with vascular indistinctness suggestive of mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Additionally, small bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is clearly visualized.
