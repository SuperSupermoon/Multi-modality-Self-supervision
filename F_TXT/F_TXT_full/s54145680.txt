There is large right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded. The left lung is clear. No evidence of a left-sided pleural effusion is seen. The right aspect of the cardiac silhouette is not well assessed due to the large right mid to lower hemithorax opacification, however, the left aspect of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unremarkable. No pulmonary edema is seen.
