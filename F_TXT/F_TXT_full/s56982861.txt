As compared to the previous radiograph, the malpositioned left PICC line has been pulled back. The tip of the line now projects over the axilla. Two chest tubes on the left are in situ. There also is a series of surgical clips projecting over the left chest wall. The extent of a basally and laterally distributed pleural effusion is constant. There is unchanged evidence of relatively extensive left basal atelectasis. The left hemithorax is unchanged in appearence. The right lung continues to be normal.
