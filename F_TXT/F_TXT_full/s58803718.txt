AP chest compared to ___: ___-mm wide opacity projecting over the anterior aspect of the right fifth anterior interspace could be nipple or gynecomastia or could be a lung nodule. I see smaller opacity in that location on ___ when there was a companion opacity on the left side. Just to confirm that these are nipples, I would recommend shallow oblique views with nipple markers. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or free subdiaphragmatic gas. Heart size is normal, and the cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes unremarkable. Upper enteric drainage tube ends above the gastroesophageal junction and would need to be advanced at least 13 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. Left PIC line ends low in the SVC.
