In the region of recent bronchoscopy as evidenced by the fluoroscopic images obtained the same day, there is a vague 6.1 x 4.3 cm opacification, likely represents hemorrhage, not unexpected. In addition, there is an opacification in the right infrahilar space with a suggestion of volume loss. This likely represents subsegmental collapse of the right middle lobe. Streaky bibasilar atelectatic changes present. There appears to be a small right apical pneumothorax with the superior pleural line projecting immediately inferior to the posterior right third rib. Minimal blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles may represent tiny pleural effusions versus pleural thickening.
