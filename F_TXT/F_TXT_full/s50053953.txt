Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 4.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Lung volumes remain markedly diminished with patchy bibasilar opacities consistent with partial lower lobe atelectasis and probable associated left pleural effusion. Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
