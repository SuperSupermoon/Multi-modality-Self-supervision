Single portable chest radiograph provided. Lung volumes are slightly low. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Pathcy opacities are present bilaterally which may represent atelectasis or early infection. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits, except for minimal unfolding of the aorta. Incidental note is made of bilateral carotid artery calcifications and what appears to be an old fracture of the right proximal humerus, incompletely evaluated on these views.
