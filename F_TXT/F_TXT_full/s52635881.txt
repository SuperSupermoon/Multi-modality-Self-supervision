There is progression of the left basilar opacity silhouetting the hemidiaphragm. Vague right basilar opacity is also seen but unchanged and potentially atelectasis. Bilateral perihilar opacities are likely due to scarring as seen on prior CT. Moderate cardiac enlargement is again noted. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aorta as well as lower thoracic kyphoplasty changes.
