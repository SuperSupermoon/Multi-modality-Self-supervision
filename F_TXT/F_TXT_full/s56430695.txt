As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly increased. This could be the result of better inspiration or of increased ventilatory pressure. Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis. Unchanged elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with subsequent atelectasis at the right lung basis and, potentially, the presence of a small to moderate right pleural effusion. The position of the endotracheal tube is unchanged. Unchanged course and position of the nasogastric tube. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No pulmonary edema.
