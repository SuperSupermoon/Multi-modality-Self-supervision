The ET tube and right IJ line are unchanged. The left pleural effusion is still moderate in size, but is slightly smaller than on the prior study. There continues to be dense opacity in the perihilar regions bilaterally in the retrocardiac region with infiltrate/volume loss in both lower lungs. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution.
