Heart is upper limits of normal in size. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by mild interstitial edema. Note is also made of a patchy area of increased opacity in the right infrahilar region. This could be due to focal atelectasis, aspiration or an early focus of pneumonia. Short-term followup radiograph may be helpful in this regard. Bullous emphysema is present at the right apex, but there is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
