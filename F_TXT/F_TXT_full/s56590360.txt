Heart size is slightly larger, mild interstitial pulmonary edema has developed. Pleural effusions are not appreciable. Consolidation or collapse of the superior segment of the right lower lobe is probably still present, explaining the definition of the lowered major fissure medially. Transesophageal drainage tube would need to be advanced at least 10 cm to move all side ports into the stomach. Feeding tube passes into the distal stomach and out of view. Left jugular line ends just before the origin of the SVC. Right PIC line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
