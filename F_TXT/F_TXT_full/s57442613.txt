As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, potentially as a result from increased ventilatory pressures. As a consequence, the parenchymal opacities are less widespread and minimally less severe. Unchanged monitoring and support devices. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
