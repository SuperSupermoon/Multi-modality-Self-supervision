Lung volumes are low, but there are no focal opacities. A nodular opacity just below the margin of the right hemidiaphragm represents a calcified granuloma seen in prior CT. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A right-sided Port-A-Cath ends in the lower SVC, unchanged from prior.
