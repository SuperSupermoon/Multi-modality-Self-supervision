Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest provided. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 5 cm above the carina. The NG tube is coiled within the left upper quadrant. There is left basal atelectasis. Mild pulmonary interstitial edema is likely present though given the low lung volumes, evaluation is somewhat limited. The right CP angle is excluded. No pneumothorax is seen on this semi-upright projection.
