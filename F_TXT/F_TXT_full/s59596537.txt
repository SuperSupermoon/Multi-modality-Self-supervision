Endotracheal tube is seen terminating at least 2.5 cm from the carina; however, neck is in flexion and position probably represents lowest point at expiration. Right-sided large caliber catheter sheath is seen entering the right IJ and terminating within the upper SVC; there is severe kinking at its proximal end. There are low lung volumes bilaterally, with bronchovascular crowding and diffuse haziness with perihilar fullness consistent with mild pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size. No pleural effusion is appreciated. There is no pneumothorax.
