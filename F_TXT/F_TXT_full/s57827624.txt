Lung volumes remain low. There is increasing indistinctness of the perihilar vasculature and interstitium which suggests worsening mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities at both bases likely reflects atelectasis given low lung volumes, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable. No large effusions.
