The radiograph time stamped 21:46 shows a low-lying endotracheal tube which enters the right mainstem bronchus. The left PICC line terminates in the right atrium. Withdrawal by 3 cm would position its tip near the cavoatrial junction. A left apical chest tube remains in place. Lung volumes are low. There is no pneumothorax. Worsening bilateral airspace and interstitial opacities are most likely due to worsening pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion. Mild cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged. The followup radiograph time stamped 22:49 shows interval repositioning of the ET tube, which now terminates in the mid trachea. There is also a new tiny left apical pneumothorax with a left apical chest tube in place. The left PICC line has been slightly withdrawn, but still enters the upper right atrium. Withdrawal by 2 cm would position its tip at the cavoatrial junction. No other relevant change. The most recent radiograph of 03:57 hrs shows a slight change in the position of the left PICC line, which just barely enters the right atrium. Withdrawal by 1-2 cm with position its tip in the low SVC. There is no definite pneumothorax. Bandlike opacities at both lung bases are likely due to atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema has slightly improved. A persistent retrocardiac airspace opacity may be due to atelectasis or aspiration.
