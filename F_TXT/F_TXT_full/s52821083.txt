A graft in the ascending thoracic aorta is new. A new right transjugular right ventricular temporary pacing wire follows the expected course. Leftward displacement of the trachea is more pronounced today than previously, when it was due to a tortuous and dilated innominate artery. Possibility of local hematoma should be monitored with subsequent chest radiographs, carefully positioned to permit assessment of tracheal shift. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions have improved. There is no pneumothorax.
