In comparison with the study ___ ___, there has been substantial opacification in the mid and lower left lung with apparent air bronchograms, though the hemidiaphragm appears sharp. There also is marked prominence in the hilar regions bilaterally without evidence of indistinct vessels peripherally. The radiographic appearance is somewhat unusual. This could reflect a substantial pneumonia in a patient with sepsis, though in speaking with the referring clinician the symptoms are not suggestive of severe pneumonia. Nevertheless, the antibiotic for urosepsis would presumably be effective against organisms crossing this consolidation. There could be a substantial effusion, though the sharpness of the hemidiaphragm would be unusual. The hilar changes could represent substantial central edema related to over hydration, though the lack of peripheral edema would be unusual.
