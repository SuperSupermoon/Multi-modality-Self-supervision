The endotracheal tube ends 2.5 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube enters the stomach. There are diffuse nodular parenchymal opacities. For example in the right upper lung there is a 1.5 cm nodule. The lung volumes and mild pulmonary vascular congestion have improved compared to the prior chest radiograph performed 1.5 hours prior. The cardiac contours are obscured by the dense parenchymal opacities but the heart size is likely normal. No pneumothorax. Cervical hardware is noted.
