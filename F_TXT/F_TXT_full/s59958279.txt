Left-sided pacer remains in place. An endotracheal tube has its tip at thoracic inlet. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There is increasing bilateral layering effusions and increasing moderate pulmonary edema. A diffuse infectious process would be less likely. Followup imaging would be advised. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.
