AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Again, patient is rotated to the right. Asymmetric appearance of the frontal chest view is accentuated by previously described orthopedic hardware and vertebral body placement in the lower thoracic spine with moderate degree of general right-sided convex scoliosis. The heart size has not changed since the preceding examination. There is no evidence for pulmonary vascular congestion in the right hemithorax where the pulmonary vasculature can be identified. A new diffuse haze is overlying the entire left-sided hemithorax. As the patient is in steep dorsal tilt position, the haze can be explained by pleural effusion that is layering in the posterior pleural compartments. There is no pneumothorax seen on either side. A previously described right-sided Port-A-Cath system with entrance via the right internal jugular vein remains in unchanged position. A previously existing left internal jugular approach central venous line has been withdrawn.
