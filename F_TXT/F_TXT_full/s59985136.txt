Evaluation of the heart and lungs is limited due to patient rotation to the right. Within this limitation, the lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is slighlty enlarged, likely accentuated by technique. The mediastinum is prominent, partly related to patient rotation. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable. No acute cardiopulmonary process on this technically limited examination.
