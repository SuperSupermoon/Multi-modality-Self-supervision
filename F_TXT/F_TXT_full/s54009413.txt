AP chest compared to ___ through ___: A severe widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has changed in distribution, somewhat better in the left upper lung, worse on the right, and there has been an increase in cardiac diameter suggesting that much of the abnormality is volume or cardiac related pulmonary edema. Of course concurrent pneumonia and non-cardiac edema would be difficult to recognize. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. No pneumothorax.
