Compared with 1 day prior, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen an aortic replacement device in relation to the ascending aorta. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears similar. Possibility of slight volume loss on the left cannot be excluded, similar to prior. There are bilateral effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, similar to prior. There is upper zone redistribution, consistent with CHF, also overall similar to the prior film. The possibility of underlying parenchymal scarring cannot be excluded. Compared to the prior film, there may be some increased opacity in both lung apices, though there is also more lordotic positioning on the current film. 3 drains, tapes or other devices overlie the upper chest. Clips again noted in the region of the GE junction. Left-sided PICC line lies in the region of the cavoatrial junction.
