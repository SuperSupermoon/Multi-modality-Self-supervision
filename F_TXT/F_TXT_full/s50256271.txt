Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right upper lobe opacity appears to be improved, although still present, minimal and might correspond to improvement, partial, of asymmetric pulmonary edema. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The pacemaker leads terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle crossing the midline, unchanged in appearance. No appreciable pneumothorax is present.
