As compared to the previous image, no relevant change is seen. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung bases. Moderate cardiomegaly. Moderate scoliosis. No overt pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions. A lateral radiograph would be helpful in determining the cause for a minimal increase in density surrounding the upper and lower aspects of the right hilus.
