As compared to the previous radiograph, the known right pleural effusion has substantially decreased. The contour of the right hemidiaphragm is again visualized. However, extensive pulmonary edema and a relatively large right-sided consolidation persists. Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with retrocardiac atelectasis. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position. No new parenchymal opacities.
