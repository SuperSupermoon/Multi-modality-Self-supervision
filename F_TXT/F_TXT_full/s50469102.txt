1. Patient's mandible obscures the apices. There are persistent low lung volumes with interval increasing indistinctness of the pulmonary vascularity likely representing mild-to-moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema. There is likely a layering left effusion. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient positioning. No pneumothorax.
