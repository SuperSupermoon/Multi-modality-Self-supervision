Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates the ET tube terminating approximately 1.7 cm above the carina. An enteric tube courses inferiorly out of view into the stomach. The heart is normal in size. There is evidence of prior coronary arterial bypass surgery and aortic valve replacement. Calcifications are seen in the aortic arch. The lung volumes are low. There is moderate perihilar fluffy opacity as well as veil-like appearance of the lungs, left greater than right, suggestive of vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema. The opacities appear particularly confluent in the right greater than left lower lungs, which could represent sequela of aspiration, with infection not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
