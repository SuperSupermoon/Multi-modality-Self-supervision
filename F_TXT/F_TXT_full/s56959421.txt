Lungs are hyperexpanded. Increased lucency in the left base is more prominent than on previous chest radiographs. Increased lucency in the right base is stable and likely represents sequela of emphysema. The mediastinal contours, hila, and cardiac borders are normal. Endotracheal tube terminates 6.3 cm above the carina. Left PICC is stable terminating in the low SVC. No pleural effusion. Enteric tube is unchanged with distal tip coursing out of view.
