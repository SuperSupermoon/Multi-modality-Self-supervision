Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic knob are again present. Lung volumes are low with crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Diffuse increased interstitial opacities likely reflect chronic changes. Patchy opacity in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis but is nonspecific. No overt pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is present. There is no large pleural effusion. No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
