There is slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm of uncertain significance. Subtle patchy opacity at the right medial lung base likely reflects atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. The left lung is clear. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits given portable technique.
