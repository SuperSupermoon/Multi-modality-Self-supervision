The heart is mildly enlarged. The aortic arch is again calcified with similar unfolding. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is again a small eventration of the right hemidiaphragm. Streaky left basilar opacity suggests minimal atelectasis. The lungs appear otherwise clear. There is no definite pleural effusion, although small pleural effusions would be difficult to exclude. There is no pneumothorax.
