In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is little change in the appearance of the endotracheal tube, which appears to be well positioned. Other monitoring and support devices remain in place. Again there is diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacification, though it has decreased on both sides. Again, this could reflect some improving pulmonary vascular congestion and substantial airspace consolidation, especially on the left.
