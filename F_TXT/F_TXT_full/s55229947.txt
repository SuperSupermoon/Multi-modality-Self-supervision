Previous pulmonary vascular engorgement has resolved. There is no edema or substantial pleural effusion. Previously collapsed left lower lobe is now almost fully aerated. Left PIC line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. Esophageal drainage tube ends in the upper stomach but would need to be advanced at least 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
