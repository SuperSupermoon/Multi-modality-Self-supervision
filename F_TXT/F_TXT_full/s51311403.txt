Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Slight prominence of the paratracheal soft tissues without definite indentation on the adjacent trachea may relate to vascular structures vs less likely enlarged thyroid gland.
