The ET tube terminates approximately 28 mm above the carina. The remainder of the lines and tubes are in appropriate position. There has been interval removal of a right-sided chest tube compared to the prior exam. No definite pneumothorax is identified. There has been interval increase in consolidation at the left lung base which could be secondary to atelectasis; however, an acute infectious process cannot be excluded. There is a stable moderate right and small left-sided pleural effusions. Again seen is pulmonary vascular engorgement with stable mild bilateral pulmonary edema.
