AP chest compared to ___: There is no pneumothorax or appreciable right pleural effusion. However, consolidation in the right middle lobe and more heterogeneous opacification in the right lower lobe may have increased since the previous study. Extensive adenopathy in the right hilus and particularly in the paratracheal mediastinum suggests two diagnostic possibilities, obstructing malignancy or primary tuberculosis. Left lung is grossly clear and the heart size is normal.
