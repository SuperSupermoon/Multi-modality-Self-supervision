As compared to the previous image, there is unchanged evidence of a relatively widespread right lung multifocal pneumonia. The severity and extent of the changes has slightly increased as compared to the outside hospital film. On the left, there is a zone of increased lung opacity around the hilus which could, however, be atelectatic in origin. Otherwise, the left lung shows no signs of infection. No pleural effusions. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
