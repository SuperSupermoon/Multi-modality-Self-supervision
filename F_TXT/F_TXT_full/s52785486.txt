A right internal jugular large-bore central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC, unchanged. An endotracheal tube ends 2.5 cm above the level of the carina. A left subclavian central venous catheter ends near the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins, previously seen to end within the uppermost portion of the SVC. An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm, ending in the proximal duodenum, not significantly changed. Lung volumes remain very low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature. Bilateral lower lung heterogeneous opacities are likely atelectasis, although infection in either lung base is certainly possible. There has been an interval increase in left mid to lower lung opacities, possibly aspiration or pneumonia. Small right and probable trace left pleural effusions are not significantly changed compared to the prior radiograph from ___. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not significantly changed. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
