AP chest compared to ___: Small volume of left pleural effusion has recurred following left thoracentesis. I do not believe there is any pneumothorax, although a skin fold simulates a pleural edge. Multiple nodular opacities have stabilized in size in the better inflated left lung, but now the nodules in the right lung are more obvious than they were previously, either multiple pulmonary metastases or disseminated infection, including septic emboli.
