There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube with distal tip coursing into the right apex. A right-sided pneumothorax now appears larger as compared to the prior study when it was not apparent. There is persistent collapse of the right mid-to-lower lung. Persistent patchy opacity at the left lung base could be due to infection and/or aspiration. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Endotracheal tube remains approximately 5.7 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, inferior aspect likely not included on the image; however, the side port appears to be at the level of the GE junction, recommend advancement so that the side port is well within the stomach.
