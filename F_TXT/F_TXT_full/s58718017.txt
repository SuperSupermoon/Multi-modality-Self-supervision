Lung volumes are lower. This may account in part for greater of opacification in the left lung today. Both lungs are still affected by heterogeneous opacification greatest in the lower lobes. There is no pleural effusion. Mild cardiomegaly is chronic. Feeding tube ends in the upper stomach. Left supraclavicular central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC. Vascular stents project over the left axilla and subclavian regions. No pneumothorax.
