Interval extubation. Decreased lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflecting atelectasis. Crowding of the vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema. No large effusions. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning and inspiratory effort.
