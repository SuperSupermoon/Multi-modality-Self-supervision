An endotracheal tube terminates about 4 cm above the carina. The heart is probably normal in size. Projecting over the medial right lung apex is a large partly obscured round opacity measuring about 5 cm in diameter. There are several possible etiologies including a mass lesion, aneurysm, or perhaps less likely, a loculated fluid collection. There are streaky opacities at the left lung base and a right mid lung opacity; atelectasis or pneumonia could be considered for these. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated, which may reflect a variety of etiologies including potentially a subpulmonic effusion, noting minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus. There is no pneumothorax.
