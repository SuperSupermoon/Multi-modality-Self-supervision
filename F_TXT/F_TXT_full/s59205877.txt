A subtle linear lucency in the undersurface of the medial portion of the right hemidiaphragm is equivocal but raises concern for pneumoperitoneum. At 10:30AM, prior to report approval, a repeat upright chest radiograph or a lateral decubitus view was recommmended to the clinical house officer caring for this patient after hospital admission.
