There is change in the position of the Swan-___ catheter tip which is currently coiled most likely within the right ventricular outflow tract or potentially in the left main pulmonary artery which might explain the change in the waveform. ET tube tip continues to be very low right in the carinal and should be pulled back 2.5 cm. Left internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. There is interval improvement of pulmonary edema which is still substantial at associated with bilateral pleural effusions.
