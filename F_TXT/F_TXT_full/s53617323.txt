As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support devices are in constant position, including the esophageal stent. The amount of free intra-abdominal air has decreased. Also slightly decreased is the extent of the right pleural effusion and the signs indicative of fluid overload. Both lung bases are better ventilated than on the previous image. Unchanged remnant areas of atelectasis, symmetrical in distribution. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No evidence of pneumothorax.
