A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an enteric tube, with the tip in the stomach. The heart remains mildly enlarged, with decrease in mediastinal caliber. The lungs are moderately inflated. There is no focal consolidation, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The left pleural effusion seen on prior chest radiographs is improved, with only a trace amount of pleural fluid, if any. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
