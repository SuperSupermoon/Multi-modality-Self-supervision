Collapse has improved in the right middle lobe, but not the right lower lobe. Mild pulmonary edema and generalized pulmonary vascular congestion persists. Heart is at least moderately enlarged and central pulmonary artery enlargement suggests pulmonary arterial hypertension. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. No pneumothorax.
