There are no prior chest radiographs available for review. Lung volumes are low. Opacification at both lung bases could be atelectasis alone or recent aspiration or early pneumonia. An oblong well circumscribed lucency at the base of the left lung projected over the left heart border could be a bulla or a herniated loop of bowel. There is no CT scan of the abdomen chest to clarify this. Close followup advised. Left pleural effusion is small. Similar right pleural effusion is likely. No pneumothorax. Heart size normal.
