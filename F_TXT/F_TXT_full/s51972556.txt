AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study dated ___. During the one-day interval, the previously existing right-sided chest tube has been removed. There is now a small apical pleural separation of less than 0.5 cm in width. Otherwise, the lungs appear well aerated and the previously present plate atelectasis on the right lung base remains unchanged. Similar as on previous examination, there exists a hazy density in the left upper lobe area, probably a pneumonic infiltrate. Heart size and mediastinal structures remain unchanged and the same holds for the double-lumen catheter introduced via the right internal jugular approach and terminating in the mid portion of the SVC.
