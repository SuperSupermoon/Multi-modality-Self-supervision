Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. A left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is subtly seen, appears to terminate in the region of the mid to proximal left subclavian but not seen more proximal to this. There are relatively low lung volumes without focal consolidation. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes.
