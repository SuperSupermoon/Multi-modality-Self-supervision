Study is slightly limited by patient rotation. The heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged. New focal opacity is seen within the right lung base. Patchy opacity is also seen within the left lung base. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures as a result of low lung volumes. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is present.
