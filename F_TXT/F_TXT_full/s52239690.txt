As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are constant. Constant low lung volumes with minimal fluid overload and areas of atelectasis at the lung bases, but no evidence of newly occurred parenchymal opacity, potentially suggestive of pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
