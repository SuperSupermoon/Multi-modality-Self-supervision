Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed. The ET tube tip is 4.3 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unremarkable. Left pleural effusion and left basal consolidation is demonstrated with effusion being most likely loculated. The right lung is demonstrating right upper lung opacity, with broad differential diagnosis starting with infection, with potentially neoplasm present. Correlation with outside cross-sectional imaging is recommended if available. Otherwise, close followup with subsequent chest radiographs is required. Cystic lesion within the right proximal humerus is noted, partially imaged and may be correlated with dedicated views.
