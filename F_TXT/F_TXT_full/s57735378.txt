In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with extensive fibrocalcific changes in both apices. Prominence of interstitial markings is seen, which could reflect a chronic interstitial abnormality better assessed on the previous CT study. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
