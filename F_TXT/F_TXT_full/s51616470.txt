There has been interval removal of a right internal jugular transvenous pacer from ___ but a right IJ sheath is in place with the tip terminating in the upper SVC at its origin. A left pectoral pacemaker has been placed in the interval from the prior study with two leads, which appear to terminate in the right atrium and in the apex of the right ventricle on this single frontal view. The inspiratory lung volumes remain low, which accentuates the appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Allowing for this, the cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable. Mild engorgement of the pulmonary vessels is unchanged. Mild diffuse opacification of the bilateral lungs, greater on the right than the left, likely reflects a combination of mild pulmonary edema and subsegmental atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacification at the left lung base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally. No pneumothorax is detected. There is significant S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis.
