Slightly rotated positioning. The left IJ central line tip overlies the upper right atrium. No pneumothorax is detected. Sternotomy wires are present and there is probable cardiomegaly. There is upper zone re-distribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. Hazy opacity at the lung bases suggests layering effusions, likely with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. The CHF and pleural parenchymal findings are new compared with the ___ CXR. Note is made of slight change in caliber in the trachea at the level of the lower neck, which is similar to the ___ film.
