1. Interval improvement in the right pleural effusion with dramatic decrease in overall size and improved aeration throughout the right lung. There is persistent opacity at the right base likely reflecting residual partial lower lobe atelectasis. No definite pneumothorax is seen. There is a small layering left effusion with associated retrocardiac consolidation most likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Persistent relatively low lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning between studies.
