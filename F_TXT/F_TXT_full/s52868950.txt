1. Right internal jugular dual-lumen large-bore catheter, and endotracheal tube are unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube is coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Overall, there is improving bilateral airspace process with perihilar fullness consistent with improving, but still moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. There is slight improvement in aeration in the retrocardiac area, but there is still persistent consolidation likely representing compressive atelectasis as there are also likely layering bilateral effusions. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
