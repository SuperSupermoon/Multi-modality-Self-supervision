In comparison with study of ___, there has been a substantial decrease in opacification bilaterally no evidence of post thoracentesis pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal in size. There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggesting some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Although there appears to have been significant decrease in the pleural effusions bilaterally, some of this could reflect a more upright position of the patient.
