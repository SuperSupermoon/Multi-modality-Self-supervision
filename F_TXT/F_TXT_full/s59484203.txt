The left internal jugular central venous catheter is noted to terminate in the mid SVC. A Dobbhoff tube is present with the tip overlying the stomach and the most proximal side port just below the hemidiaphragms. There is no free air below the hemidiaphragms, although the exam is limited by semi-upright position and penetration. The lung volumes are low. Mild pulmonary edema has slightly worsened. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or new consolidation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
