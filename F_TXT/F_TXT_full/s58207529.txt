Since the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there has been substantial worsening of bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema. There are probably at least small bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiomegaly is grossly unchanged. An ET tube terminates 4 cm above the carina. An enteric tube passes subdiaphragmatically, but terminates outside the field of view. A right IJ central venous catheter terminates at the expected location of the superior cavoatrial junction. All but the superior 2 median sternotomy wires are fractured and malaligned, but unchanged appearance since 1 day prior.
