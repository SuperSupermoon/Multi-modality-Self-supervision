Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The right-sided pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right atrium and right ventricle. The patient is rotated and within those limitations cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Substantial interstitial changes in the lung bases, right, better appreciated than left, are noted and might reflect mild vascular engorgement but infectious process is a possibility, reassessment with symmetric chest radiograph is recommended. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen. No discontinuation of the pacemaker leads demonstrated.
