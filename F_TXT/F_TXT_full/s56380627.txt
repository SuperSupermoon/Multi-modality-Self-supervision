As compared to the previous radiograph, there is substantial increase in extent of a pre-existing right pleural effusion. The effusion now occupies approximately ___% of the right hemithorax, causing extensive atelectasis at the right lung bases. On the left, the elevation of the hemidiaphragm, that pre existed, has also increased. The precise size the cardiac silhouette can no longer be determined. Increases in diameter of the perihilar vessels suggest the presence of mild pulmonary edema.
