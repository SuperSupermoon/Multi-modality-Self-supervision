No pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion if any, left apical thoracostomy tube in place. Rectangular opacity in the left upper chest lateral to vascular clips at the left hilus could be atelectasis, intra pulmonary hemorrhage, or pleural fluid loculation, particularly in the left major fissure. Mediastinal contours are mildly widened compared preoperative appearance on ___, most likely due to increased intravascular volume. Both of these findings should be followed radiographically to exclude active bleeding. The upper esophagus is distended, not necessarily significant finding. Right lung is clear. Heart size is normal.
