1. Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip at the thoracic inlet, approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. Right subclavian Port-A-Cath continues to have its tip in the proximal right atrium. There continues to be airspace consolidations in both lower lobes as well as more patchy opacities in the both upper lobes and right mid lung. These findings are not significantly changed since 3:17 a.m. but are concerning for a multifocal pneumonia/aspiration. Sclerosis of the right coracoid process is consistent with known metastasis. No pleural effusions. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-erect positioning. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
