As compared to the previous radiograph, the drainage device is projecting over the left hemithorax, the central venous access line on the right as well as the nasogastric tube positioned in an elevated stomach are constant in appearance. The extent of a pre-existing left pleural effusion has decreased. On the right, a minimal pleural effusion is seen and bilaterally areas of atelectasis continue to be visible at the lung bases. The lung apices, however, appear better ventilated than on the previous image. No new parenchymal opacities are visualized.
