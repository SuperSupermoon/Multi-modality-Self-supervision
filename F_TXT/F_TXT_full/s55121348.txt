Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are chronic, but there is no pulmonary edema. Left lower costal pleural thickening is unchanged since at least ___ eleventh. No good evidence for pneumonia. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such abnormalities. If the demonstration of such a chest cage abnormality is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
