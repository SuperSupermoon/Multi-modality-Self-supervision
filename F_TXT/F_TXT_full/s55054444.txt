Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly appears relatively unchanged compared to the prior exam. Mild pulmonary edema is present, slightly improved compared to the prior study. Ill-defined opacities in the lung bases may reflect compressive atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude. Small pleural effusions are noted bilaterally. No pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
