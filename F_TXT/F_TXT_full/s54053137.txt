A single portable frontal upright view of the chest was obtained. Apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and widening of the mediastinum is likely related to the portable technique and the patient's rotated position. Redemonstrated are linear areas of scarring, most prominent at the base of the right lung. There is no focal consolidation. The lungs are symmetrically expanded bilaterally. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is relatively unchanged and may reflect a small chronic right pleural effusion or pleural thickening in this region. There is no pneumothorax.
