Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates stable massive cardiomegaly. Increased opacification of the bilateral bases likely represents a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion. Indistinctness of the hila bilaterally and increased interstitial markings are consistent with mild pulmonary edema. No definite consolidation identified.
