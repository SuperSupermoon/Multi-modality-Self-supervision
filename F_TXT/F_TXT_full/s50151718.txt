As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen in extent of the known right apical pneumothorax as well as of the right air collection in the soft tissues. The pre-existing opacities at the right lung bases, the size of the cardiac silhouette and the appearance of the left lung, as well as the monitoring and support devices, are also constant.
