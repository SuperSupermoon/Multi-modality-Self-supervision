The patient remains intubated. The balloon of the endotracheal tube seems somewhat overinflated. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach. A right internal jugular introducer catheter remains. Aortic valve prosthesis is also noted. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. Right upper lung opacity has continued to improve. Left perihilar opacification shows apparent increased, particularly compared to the right, where aeration has markedly improved. However, it is possible that apparent increase in left perihilar opacification may reflect differences in orientation to some degree. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
