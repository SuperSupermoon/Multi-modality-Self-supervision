Stable cardiomegaly. The hilar contour is unremarkable. A left basilar opacity effaces the left costophrenic angle as well as the left heart border. There is right base atelectasis. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests effusion. Again appreciated is a 3.7 x 1.4 cm spiculated mass in the left lung apex with fiducial marker. No acute bony abnormality is identified.
