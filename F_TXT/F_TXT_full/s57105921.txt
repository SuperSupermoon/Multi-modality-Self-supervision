The patient is status post tracheostomy. A PICC line terminates in the lower superior vena cava. The patient is status post aortic and mitral valve replacements. There is also a pacemaker/ICD device with leads in the right ventricle and coronary sinus. The heart is moderately enlarged. Retrocardiac opacification persist, and now there is also increasing hazy opacity suggesting a layering effusion on the left, possibly moderate in size. New focal opacities in the right upper and probably lower lobes are concerning for pneumonia, although there is also background of suspected mild vascular congestion and a small newly apparent right-sided pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Impression: 1. New multifocal opacities suggesting pneumonia. 2. Persistent retrocardiac opacification, atelectasis versus potentially pneumonia. 3. Suspected vascular congestion.
