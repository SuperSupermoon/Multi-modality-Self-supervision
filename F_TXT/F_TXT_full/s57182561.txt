Compared to the previous radiograph, there is an improvement, with increased transparency of the right lung and decreased signs of fluid overload. However, signs of overt pulmonary edema and a pleural effusion are still present on the left. The size of the cardiac silhouette continues to be substantially enlarged. As a consequence, areas of retrocardiac atelectasis are seen. Internal jugular vein catheter and the left pectoral pacemaker are constant in appearance.
