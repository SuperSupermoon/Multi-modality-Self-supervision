In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better inspiration. Patchy areas of increased opacification are again seen bilaterally. Although some of this could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure, more coalescent area of opacification in the right and possibly left upper zones is worrisome for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. There is also suggestion of an area of opacification at the left base that could represent an infectious process. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe with an associated pleural effusion.
