Previous improvement seen earlier today in bilateral severe perihilar pulmonary consolidation, has reversed. It could be due in part to changes in positive under pressure ventilation support and/or fluid volume, since there was an accompanying transient decrease in cardiac size, particularly right atrium. Mild small to moderate right and small left pleural effusion are unchanged. No pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube midline. Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax. PEG tube ends in distended stomach.
