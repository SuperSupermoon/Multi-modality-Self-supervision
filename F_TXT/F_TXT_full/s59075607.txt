As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube has been re-positioned. The patient also has been extubated. The nasogastric tube is in unchanged position. The atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung areas is unchanged and there is a new basal, probably atelectatic opacity at the left lung base. On the right, the sidehole of the chest tube is now in the thorax. A millimetric right pneumothorax is present, without evidence of tension. The extent of the soft tissue air collection on the right is unchanged.
