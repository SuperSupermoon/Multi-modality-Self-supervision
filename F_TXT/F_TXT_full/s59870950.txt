A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest wall pacer device with a single lead overlying the right ventricle, a right PICC terminating in the low SVC, and clips projecting over the midline upper abdomen. There is mild to moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged. Increased opacity over the medial right lower lung and left lower hemi thorax, with retrocardiac opacity, may be related to layering pleural effusions. A superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the right clinical setting. New left mediastinal shift is concerning for left lower lobe atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
