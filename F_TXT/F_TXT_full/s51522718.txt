Again seen is a right subclavian central line with tip over proximal SVC. No pneumothorax detected. Inspiratory volumes are low. Allowing for this, the heart is not enlarged. Apparent upper zone redistribution is likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. Doubt CHF. There is patchy opacity at the right base medially and minimal atelectasis at the left base. Appearances at the right base are more pronounced than on ___ and raise the possibility of a pneumonic infiltrate. The right hilum also appears somewhat more prominent on today's exam. No effusions identified. Right hemidiaphragm slightly elevated.
