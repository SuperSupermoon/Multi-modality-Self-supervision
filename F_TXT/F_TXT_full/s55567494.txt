Left-sided chest tube remains in place. Previously evident pneumothorax at the left apex is no longer visualized, but there remains an unusually sharp delineation of the left cardiomediastinal contour, which could potentially represent a small residual anteromedial pneumothorax on this side. Pulmonary vascular congestion has improved in the interval. Moderate gastric distention is noted in the imaged upper abdomen.
