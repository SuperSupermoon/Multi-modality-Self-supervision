AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. On the present examination, a left-sided PICC line is identified, seen to terminate overlying the right-sided mediastinal structures at a level 4 cm below the carina. This is compatible with the lower third of the SVC. The termination point appears to be just above the expected entrance into the right atrium. No pneumothorax is identified. Chest findings of the single view demonstrate a heart size within normal limits and no evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates. A local deformity of the seventh right-sided rib in posterior lateral location indicates an old healed rib fracture. On the previous chest examination of ___, a left-sided PICC line had deviated into the left jugular vein and re-positioning was recommended. Referring physician, ___, was paged to transmit findings at 3:15 p.m.
