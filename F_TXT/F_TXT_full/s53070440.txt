Intervally placed pigtail thoracostomy tube is seen in the right upper mid chest with resultant decrease in size of apical pneumothorax. Lucency along the right mediastinum could reflect a small-to-moderate right medial pneumothorax. Displaced anterolateral right ___ to 7th rib fractures and extensive subcutaneous gas is again seen without focal consolidation or mediastinal shift. Trace if any right pleural effusion is seen. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
