Single portable semi-upright chest radiographdemonstrates intact median sternotomy wires. Lung volumes are low with crowding of vasculature. There is moderate pulmonary edema with cephalization of vasculature. Mild increase in left base opacity is noted. Small bilateral, left greater than right, pleural effusions have slightly increased in size since previous examination. No pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is likely accentuated due to low lung volumes and patient positioning. Mediastinal contour and hila are otherwise unremarkable. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen is within normal limits. Posterior fusion device of thoracic spine is again seen.
