As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Extent of the pleural effusions is bilaterally unchanged, but given changes in patient position, they distribute in a slightly different manner. There is evidence of mild fluid overload and moderate cardiomegaly with relatively extensive bilateral areas of atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Unchanged appearance of the sternal wires. Unchanged right internal jugular vein catheter.
