A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The tracheostomy is in standard position. Lung volumes are very low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. Atelectasis is seen at the right lung base. There is no large pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
