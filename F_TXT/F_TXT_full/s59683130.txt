Large right pleural effusion has increased and mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature more engorged and mild pulmonary edema developed in the perihilar lungs. Right lung is largely obscured by the effusion, but there are no findings to suggest pneumonia. Heart size normal and unchanged. Right and left supraclavicular central venous catheters end in the right atrium. No pneumothorax.
