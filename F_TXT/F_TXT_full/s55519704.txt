Comparison is made with prior study ___. ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Cardiac size is normal. The aorta is tortuous. Right lower lobe opacity has worsened consistent with worsening atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions. Left lower lobe atelectasis has minimally increased. There is no evident pneumothorax.
