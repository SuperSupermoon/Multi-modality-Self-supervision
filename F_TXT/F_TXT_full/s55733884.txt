In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside facility, there has been substantial decrease in the bilateral pulmonary opacifications. Monitoring and support devices have been removed. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Mild prominence of the ascending and descending aorta raise the possibility of underlying hypertension. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Are mild focal areas of opacification suggested at the bases. In view of the relatively low lung volumes, these could merely reflect areas of atelectasis. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered.
