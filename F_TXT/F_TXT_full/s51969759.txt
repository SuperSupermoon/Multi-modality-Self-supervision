Again seen is a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter, with tip overlying the proximal right pulmonary artery. There has been slight interval clearing of opacity at the left base and possible slight overall improvement in CHF findings. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the prior film. Probable small right effusion, unchanged.
