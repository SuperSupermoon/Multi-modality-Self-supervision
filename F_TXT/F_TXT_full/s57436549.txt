A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect a combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis. Pulmonary vasculature is enlarged, predominantly in the perihilar regions, in the setting of cardiomegaly. The upper lung zones are clear. No pneumothorax. Mediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Degenerative change is seen at the right acromioclavicular joint.
