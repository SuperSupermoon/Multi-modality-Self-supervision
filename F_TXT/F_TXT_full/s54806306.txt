Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a right-sided central venous catheter with distal lead tip in the mid right atrium. This could be pulled back 3-4 cm for more optimal placement. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 7 cm above the carina at the level of the aortic knob, appropriately sited. The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal. There are airspace opacities bilaterally, most confluent in the left mid lung field. This may represent underlying infiltrate. There is also an infiltrate at the right base laterally, which appears stable. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema. There are no pneumothoraces. The distal tip of the endotracheal tube is not included on the field of view of the study that cuts off the lung bases.
