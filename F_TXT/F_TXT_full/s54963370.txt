Persistent mild-to-moderate edema in the right lung, minimally worse to overall unchanged when accounting for redistribution. Persistent asymmetric consolidation in the right infrahilar region is perhaps slightly more conspicuous on today's exam and could represent aspiration or atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion and atelectasis is overall unchanged. No pneumothorax. The heart is moderately enlarged, increased from the prior exam. Median sternotomy wires and clips appear intact and unchanged.
