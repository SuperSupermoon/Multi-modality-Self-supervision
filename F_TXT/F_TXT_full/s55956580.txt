In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the appearance of the mediastinum with no evidence of post-procedure pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. There is some indistinctness of pulmonary markings at the right base, raising the possibility of some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Blunting of the costophrenic angles is seen bilaterally.
