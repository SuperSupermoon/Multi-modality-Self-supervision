The patient is status post sternotomy and probably coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A PICC line has been removed. The heart is mild to moderately enlarged, as before. There is new perihilar fullness and indistinct prominent interstitial markings, suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. In addition, new opacities have developed in the medial lung bases, probably greater on the right than the left, which are highly nonspecific. In the setting of an inflammatory process in the abdomen, atelectasis could be considered or possibly pneumonia.
