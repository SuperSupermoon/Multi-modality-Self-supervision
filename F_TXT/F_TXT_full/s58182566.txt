When compared to previous exam, there has been no definite interval change. Degree of cardiomegaly is unchanged. Bibasilar opacities, right greater than left are again seen compatible with bronchiectasis and peribronchial opacities. These may have subtly increased at the right lung base compared to prior. Apparent increased opacity projecting over the right upper lung is due to patient's overlying scapula which was not in this position on prior.
