AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The patient was extubated in the meantime interval. There is substantial interval improvement in pulmonary edema. There is still present right pleural effusion, but there is reopening of the right lower lobe atelectasis, at least partial. There is left lower lobe consolidation and left pleural effusion. They appear to be unchanged since the prior study. There is no pneumothorax. Followup of the patient to exclude the possibility of central obstruction is recommended for documentation of complete opening of the basal atelectasis. Several calcifications are demonstrated in the anterior chest wall, potentially might reflect prior silicone injection, please correlate with patient history.
