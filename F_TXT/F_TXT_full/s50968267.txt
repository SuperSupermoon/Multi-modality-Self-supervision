As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 5 cm above the carina. The tube could be advanced by 1-2 cm. The patient has also received a nasogastric tube, the course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not included on the image. As compared to the previous image, the lung volumes have increased, and the size of the cardiac silhouette has minimally decreased. The pre-existing signs indicative of pulmonary edema, however, are unchanged and still moderate in severity. There are no pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax.
