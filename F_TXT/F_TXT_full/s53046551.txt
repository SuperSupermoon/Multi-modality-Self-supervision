In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. The carina is difficult to assess on this study, but the endotracheal tube probably is about 4.5 cm above it. Nasogastric tube extends to the distal stomach. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
