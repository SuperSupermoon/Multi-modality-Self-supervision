Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There are new bilateral apical chest tubes. Small bilateral pleural effusions have markedly decreased in size, more so in the one on the right. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is better appreciated in the current study. Mild pulmonary edema has improved. Bibasilar atelectases have markedly improved. There is no evident pneumothorax. Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery is again noted.
