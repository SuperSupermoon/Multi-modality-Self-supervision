Comparison is made to the previous study from ___. There is again seen a left-sided chest tube. There is a small left apical pneumothorax which is unchanged in size. Median sternotomy wires are seen, and there is scoliosis of thoracic spine. There is again seen a left retrocardiac opacity with areas of consolidation and likely left-sided pleural fluid. There is a small right-sided pleural effusion. The right lung is relatively well aerated. Overall, these findings are all unchanged.
