There is worsening of the right lung base opacity when compared to the prior CXR performed earlier this morning. There is likely still underlying pleural effusion with new right lower lobe collapse. The left lung is essentially clear. No pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube and enteric tube are unchanged in position. Stable moderate cardiomegaly. No acute osseous abnormalities.
