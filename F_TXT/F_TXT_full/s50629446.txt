AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study ___ ___. A tracheostomy cannula is in place, seen to terminate in the trachea 5 cm above the level of the carina. The position is unchanged. A right-sided PICC line is noted, seen to terminate overlying the right-sided mediastinal structures at the level of the carina. This corresponds to the mid portion of the SVC. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. The heart size may have increased mildly in comparison with the previous portable chest examination, but this assessment is uncertain, considering portable technique and bedside examination resulting in geometric distortion. The pulmonary vasculature appears more crowded than before, but this is most likely related to patient's poorer inspirational effort with relatively high-positioned diaphragms. Perivascular haze or central pulmonary edema cannot be identified on this portable examination. Also, the lateral pleural sinuses are free from any major pleural effusion. No new acute discrete parenchymal infiltrates can be seen; however, the crowded appearance of the vasculature creates some linear structures on the bases most likely representing atelectasis. More older chest examinations are reviewed and it is noted that the patient had similar chest findings already on ___ before the tracheostomy was performed. The PICC line have been placed and identified on chest examination ___ ___.
