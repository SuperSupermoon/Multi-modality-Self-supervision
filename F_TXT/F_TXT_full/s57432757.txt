AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Multiple large calcified pulmonary nodules are all that remain of previous tuberculosis. There is no evidence of reactivation infection. The heart is mildly enlarged. No pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy. Healed right posterior rib fracture should not be mistaken for lung nodules.
