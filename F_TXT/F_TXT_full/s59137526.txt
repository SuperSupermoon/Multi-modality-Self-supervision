Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. A dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads in the expected position of the right atrium and right ventricle. A right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the expected location of the proximal SVC. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Prominence of the hila may relate to pulmonary vascular engorgement with possible underlying pulmonary hypertension. There may be a small right pleural effusion with a trace left pleural effusion difficult to exclude. There is thickening/small amount of fluid seen tracking in the minor fissure. Lungs are hyperinflated. Patchy left base opacity may relate to atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded. Attention at follow-up. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
