Heart size is mild to moderately enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. Mediastinal contours unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures due to the presence of low lung volumes with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no overt pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
