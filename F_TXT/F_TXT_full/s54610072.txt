The tracheostomy tube is not visualized. The right PICC line has since been removed. Otherwise, no significant interval change. Lung volumes remain low. Bilateral platelike atelectasis is overall similar. Low lung volumes gives the appearance of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, which is probably minimally changed from the prior exam. Cardiomediastinal silhouette are unchanged. No pneumothorax or effusion.
