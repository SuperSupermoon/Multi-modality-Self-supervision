Small right pleural effusion probably has a subpulmonic as well as a lateral costal component. Heart is top-normal size. Lungs are low in volume but otherwise essentially clear. Conventional chest radiographs occluding frontal and lateral views, I strongly recommended for more reliable detection of pneumonia. No pneumothorax is present.
