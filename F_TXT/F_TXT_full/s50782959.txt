Moderate to severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal contours are stable, with atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta noted. The hilar contours remain enlarged, with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary edema, findings which appear slightly progressed when compared to the radiograph obtained earlier the same day. More focal opacity within the peripheral aspect of the left lung base appears more pronounced compared to the prior exam, and infection or aspiration is not excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There is no free subdiaphragmatic air. Multiple clips are seen along the left lateral chest wall.
