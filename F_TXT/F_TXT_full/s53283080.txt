Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in standard position. Permanent pacemaker remains in place, with one lead terminating in the right atrium, and a second right atrial lead with a very tortuous course, which has been present on multiple prior radiographs and is probably unchanged allowing for the degree of patient rotation. However, attention to this on a non-rotated radiograph would be helpful for more accurate comparison to prior studies. Cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and slightly improved asymmetrically distributed multifocal alveolar opacities, likely a combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia. The latter likely accounts for confluent opacities in the right upper and left mid lung regions. Small right and moderate left pleural effusions have slightly improved.
