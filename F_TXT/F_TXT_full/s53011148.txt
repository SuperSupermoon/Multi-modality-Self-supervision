Low lung volumes are present. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to supine positioning and low lung volumes. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present. Minimal patchy opacity in the left upper lung field may reflect an area of contusion or aspiration. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormalities detected. Surgical anchors overlie the right humeral head.
