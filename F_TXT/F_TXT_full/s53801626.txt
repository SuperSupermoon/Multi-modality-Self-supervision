Comparisons: Earlier in the same day. Technique: Chest, portable AP upright. Findings: A right-sided PICC line terminates in the lower superior vena cava. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. The lung volumes are low. The left base is somewhat better aerated but with persistent opacification, probably due to atelectasis, with a very small pleural effusion. There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right. Impression: Improving aeration at the left lung base; otherwise unchanged.
