As compared to ___ chest radiograph, 3 chest tubes remain in place in the right hemi thorax with apparent interval increase in moderate size loculated right pleural effusion with associated multiple loculated hydro pneumothorax components. Additionally, confluent opacification in the right middle and lower lobes has slightly worsened. New left retrocardiac opacification is likely due to atelectasis or aspiration given rapid development. No other relevant changes.
