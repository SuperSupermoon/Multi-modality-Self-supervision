An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 3 cm above the carina. Small segment of tubing overlies the right supraclavicular neck. The appearance does not appear to represent a PICC line. There is upper zone redistribution, possibly accentuated by upper zone scarring. There is minimal atelectasis at the left base. No pneumothorax detected. Scattered rib fractures noted, which do not appear acute. Deformity of the left humeral head is noted, consistent with remote trauma. Loss of height of at least one midthoracic vertebral body noted.
