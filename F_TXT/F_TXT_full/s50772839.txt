Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.5 cm above the level of the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, side port in the region of the gastric fundus. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature bilaterally due to vascular congestion. Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity most likely relates to atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions seen on subsequent CT are better evaluated on that study. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
