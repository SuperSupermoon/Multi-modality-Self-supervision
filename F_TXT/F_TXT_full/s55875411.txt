The lungs are clear. There is no focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Accounting for technique, the cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. The mediastinal contours are unchanged and appear normal. Slight deformity of the right distal clavicle may relate to prior trauma.
