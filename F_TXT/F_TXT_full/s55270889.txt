Near complete opacification of the right hemi thorax is again seen with small area of aeration in the medial right upper hemi thorax, grossly stable. There has been interval placement of a chest tube on the right. There has not been significant decrease in opacification of the right lung. Left base opacity persists. There has been interval placement of a chest tube projecting over the left lower hemi thorax and possibly the left upper abdomen. The left lung base otherwise appears similar as compared to the prior study.
