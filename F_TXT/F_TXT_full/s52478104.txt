Portable frontal chest radiograph. There are extensive, asymmetric interstitial opacities bilaterally, predominating the left lung. There is improved aeration of the right upper lung, while the degree of opacification in the left upper lung has worsened. These findings are noted on a background of chronic lung disease. There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, but difficult to evaluate given the parenchymal abnormalities. Dense calcifications are noted within the aortic arch and mitral valve. No pneumothorax noted on this limited study.
