Since 2 days prior, there is been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube. No pneumothorax. Bilateral, small pleural effusions are probably unchanged. Bibasilar atelectasis has substantially improved, though some areas of linear at persist. Heart size is unchanged and cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are normal. No pulmonary vascular congestion. A right-sided PICC terminates in the mid SVC.
