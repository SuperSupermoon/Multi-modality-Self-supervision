AP chest compared to ___: Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has strong component of pulmonary edema which has worsened in the left lung, but there has been some improvement in the more consolidated right lung since earlier in the day despite lower lung volumes which would exaggerate the severity of the abnormality instead. Moderate cardiomegaly, unusual in a patient of this age is stable. Azygos distention suggests volume overload. ET tube and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements. Some right pleural effusion is presumed, but not large. No pneumothorax.
