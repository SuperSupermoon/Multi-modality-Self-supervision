Worsened opacification at the lung bases, particularly the left follows tracheal extubation, presumably atelectasis, but warranting followup evaluation to exclude aspiration pneumonia. Another phenomenon of tracheal extubation is a slight increase in heart size and pulmonary vascularity, but there is no edema. No pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends in the region of the tricuspid valve.
