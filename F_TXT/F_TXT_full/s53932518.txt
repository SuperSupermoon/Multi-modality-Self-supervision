AP chest compared to ___:14 p.m. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the fundus of a non-distended stomach. Heart is mildly enlarged, but the pulmonary vasculature is normal and the lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion. The very heavily calcified mitral annulus does not seem to be hemodynamically significant.
