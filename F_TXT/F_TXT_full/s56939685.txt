The study is limited due to rotation of the patient. Allowing for this limitation, there is no focal parenchymal opacity. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A catheter running parallel to the spine along the left hemithorax likely represents VP shunt, both ends are out of view. Another catheter underneath the left hemidiaphragm is incompletely imaged.
