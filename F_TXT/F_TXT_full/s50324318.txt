A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates intact sternotomy wires and mitral valve replacement. The right subclavian catheter is again seen with the tip in the right atrium, and the left jugular catheter tip is in the mid to lower SVC. The remainder of the exam is unchanged, including mild pulmonary edema, a likely small left pleural effusion, and left lower lobe atelectasis.
