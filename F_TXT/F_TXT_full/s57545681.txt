1. Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the mid SVC. The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. 2. Interval improvement in aeration with persistent predominantly perihilar airspace opacities and bilateral interstitial abnormalities, right greater than left. These findings most likely reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, although superimposed infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. There are layering effusions. There is no pneumothorax. The overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. Right shoulder prosthesis is in place. No large pneumothorax.
