In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the chest tubes remain in place. No evidence of pneumothorax. There may still be a tiny amount of gas loculated in the right costophrenic angle. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes have been removed. Left lung is essentially clear with mild atelectatic changes at the base.
