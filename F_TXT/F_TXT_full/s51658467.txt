Uniform opacification base of the right hemi thorax is more likely right lower lobe collapse than pneumonia. Any residual pneumonia would be in the left lower lobe, but atelectasis is substantial there as well accompanied by a small to moderate left pleural effusion. Upper lungs are clear. Heart is normal size. Tracheostomy tube projects over the trachea at the level of the thoracic inlet. Reviewing Chest CT scans on ___ and ___ shows the possibility of either a fissural fluid collection or a left hilar or juxta hilar mass. Most recent chest radiograph on ___ does not show a mass, but it would be prudent to obtain conventional chest radiographs on this patient when the lungs clear, to see if CT scanning is indicated.
