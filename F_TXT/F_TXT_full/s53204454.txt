1. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and left subclavian central line are unchanged in position. A tube overlying the right upper quadrant is again seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is a persistent consolidation in the right lower lobe with an associated elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which may reflect lower lobe collapse. In addition, there is a persistent retrocardiac consolidation with a layering effusion, favoring partial lower lobe atelectasis. Bibasilar pneumonia should also be considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-supine technique. Overall, there has likely not been any significant interval change since ___ at ___.
