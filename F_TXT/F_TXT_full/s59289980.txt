A persistent patchy opacification in the left mid and lower lung fields, unchanged from the prior exam. The right lower lung aeration has improved from the prior exam with resolution of the previously seen opacity. Multiple small nodules are seen bilaterally, consistent with the patient's known history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. No new opacifications are present. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
