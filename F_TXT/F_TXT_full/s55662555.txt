In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is little overall change. Layering pleural effusion is again seen on the right with compressive atelectasis at the base. On the left, there is obscuration of the hemidiaphragm consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe associated with small pleural effusion. No new parenchymal opacities.
