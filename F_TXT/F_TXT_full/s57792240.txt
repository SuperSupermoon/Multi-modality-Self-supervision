AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. No previous chest examination is available in our records for comparison. Multiple EKG leads are overlying the chest and an external air tube is overlying the right upper hemithorax. The heart size is normal. Thoracic aorta unremarkable, but shows some wall calcifications at the level of the arch. Pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there are no signs of acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. No evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area on either side. The right-sided lateral lower pleural sinus is mildly blunted, but it is unclear from this single chest view if this is pleural effusion or scar formation.
