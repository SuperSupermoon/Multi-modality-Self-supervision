As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are in constant position. The lung volumes have slightly decreased, leading to crowding of the vascular and bronchial structures, in particular at the right lung base. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Known bilateral old rib fractures. The tip of the right PICC line projects more distally on today's examination, approximately at the level of the mid-to-lower SVC.
