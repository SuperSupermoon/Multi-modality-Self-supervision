The lung volumes are low. Hazy opacification of the lung bases suggests pleural effusions of substantial size, more conspicuous and probably larger on the left than right side. Fullness of each hilum with indistinct contours is suggestive of perihilar congestion, although mild and unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
