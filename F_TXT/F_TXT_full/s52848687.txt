Emphysema is moderate to severe. Generalized interstitial abnormality is relatively evenly distributed, and although there is mild vascular engorgement in the lungs, there is no increase in normal heart size, caliber of mediastinal veins, or appreciable pleural effusion. This could be pulmonary edema in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, but probably not due to more chronic cardiac decompensation. Thoracic aorta is calcified but not dilated. Lungs are clear of any focal abnormality such as pneumonia.
