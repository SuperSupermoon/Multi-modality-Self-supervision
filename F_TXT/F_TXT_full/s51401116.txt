Somewhat limited evaluation due to patient rotation. The lungs are moderately well inflated. No definite change since outside study performed ___ hours prior. Again seen is moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly, though mediastinal and hilar contours are not effectively assessed due to considerable the patient rotation. Also again seen is apparent moderate pulmonary edema with probable small bilateral, left greater than right, pleural effusions. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is again seen. Heterogeneous radiopaque material projecting over the central mid hemi thorax is again noted. Targeted review of an outside CT from ___ suggests this lies within the spine and likely represents residua from prior kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty.
