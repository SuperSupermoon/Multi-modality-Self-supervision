An ET tube is present approximately 6.2 cm above the Carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off the film. A left subclavian central line is present, tip over mid SVC. 2 left-sided chest tubes are present, 1 with a pigtail configuration. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Again seen are is upper zone redistribution, interstitial edema, and mild vascular blurring, consistent with mild CHF and similar to the prior film. There is patchy opacity at both lung bases. There is also retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and or consolidation. Triangular opacity at the right lung base is more pronounced and could represent subsegmental atelectasis minimally displaced left posterior sixth rib fracture again noted. No gross pneumothorax, though a subtle pneumothorax might not be apparent on this film. Prominent subcutaneous emphysema along the left chest wall an overlying pectoralis muscle. A smaller amount of subcutaneous emphysema is seen along the right chest inferiorly and in the right pectoralis muscle. Multiple bilateral rib fractures, left clavicular fracture, an left scapular fracture are again noted.
