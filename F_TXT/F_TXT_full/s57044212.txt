All the monitoring and support devices are unchanged and in standard position, in particular right IJ catheter and in lower SVC. Left subclavian PICC ends in lower SVC. ET tube ends at 4 cm from carina. NG tube ends in gastric cavity, but the tip is not visualized. As compared to yesterday, lung volumes are persistently low with left retrocardiac consolidation and multiple bilateral nodules in the mid and upper lungs. The largest in the right upper lobe of 25 mm. These bilateral nodules are consistent with septic emboli or new opportunistic infection. The left lower lobe consolidation is suspicious for pneumonia. Persistent small pleural effusion on the left base. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is no pneumothorax.
