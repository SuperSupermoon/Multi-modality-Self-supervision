Comparison is made with prior study performed three hours earlier. Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper SVC. Left PICC has been removed. There is no pneumothorax. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has increased. Small right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion has probably unchanged. Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side, are a combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis. There is no evident pneumothorax. There is right mid thoracic scoliosis. Cardiomediastinal silhouette with cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum is stable.
