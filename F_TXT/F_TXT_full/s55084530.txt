Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. The lungs are clear bilaterally without focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Clips are noted in the right axilla. The heart size is normal. There is an unusual configuration of the mediastinum which is stable from prior exams and likely reflects the extensive collateral vessels due to known left subclavian and brachiocephalic venous stenosis. Bony structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
