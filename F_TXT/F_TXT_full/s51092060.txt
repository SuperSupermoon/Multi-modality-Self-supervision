The tip of the right PICC line projects over the mid to lower SVC. There has been interval removal of one of the left-sided chest tubes; a second left chest tube is present. Unchanged small left pleural effusion which layers laterally along the chest wall as well as atelectasis/ consolidation and left lung base. There is unchanged appearance of the left upper mediastinal border which may reflect a small paramedian pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Perihilar opacities persist in the right lung, likely reflective of pulmonary edema. The appearance of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
