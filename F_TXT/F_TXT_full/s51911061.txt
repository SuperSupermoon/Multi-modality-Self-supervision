Retrocardiac opacity is poorly seen on this single view but could reflect atelectasis or developing infectious process. Lungs are somewhat low in volume giving the appearance of vascular crowding, though mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present as well. Mild right base atelectasis is noted, early infection not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. Cardiac size is moderately enlarged with changes of prior coronary bypass graft noted. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
