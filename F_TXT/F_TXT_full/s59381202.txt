In comparison with the study of ___, there is some increasing opacification at the right base, consistent with substantial volume loss in the right middle and lower lobes associated with pleural effusion. The left lung remains essentially clear. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Of incidental note is an apparent healed fracture with displacement of the proximal right humerus.
