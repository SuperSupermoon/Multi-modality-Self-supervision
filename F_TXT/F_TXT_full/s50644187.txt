As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung radiograph shows widespread bilateral parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms, highly suggestive of diffuse pneumonia. Overall the vascular structures are minimally enlarged, other signs suggestive for pulmonary edema are missing. Moderate atelectasis at the left lung bases. No pleural effusions.
