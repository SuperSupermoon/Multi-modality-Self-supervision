In comparison with these study of ___, there has been a right middle lobectomy with chest tube in place. Extensive subcutaneous gas bilaterally overlying the chest an extending along the lateral chest wall to the neck somewhat obscures the appearance of the upper lungs, though there does appear to be a small apical pneumothorax. Postsurgical changes are seen on the right and there is opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis and pleural fluid.
