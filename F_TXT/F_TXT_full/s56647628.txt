Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiac size is normal. The cardiomediastinum is slightly shifted towards the left as before. Moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The patient has known emphysema, the right lung is clear. Two new fiducial seeds project in the left upper lobe. Post-radiation changes and mass like opacity in the lingua are better asses in prior CT. Worsening opacities in the retrocardiac region are likely due to worsening atelectasis.
