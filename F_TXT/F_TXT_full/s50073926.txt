In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube has been removed and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Continued bilateral pleural effusions that may be slightly more prominent than on the previous study with underlying compressive atelectasis. No definite vascular congestion. In view of the changes in the lower lungs, the possibility of a superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
