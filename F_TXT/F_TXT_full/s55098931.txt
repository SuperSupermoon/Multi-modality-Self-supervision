Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Bibasal and to lesser extent mid and upper lung interstitial opacities might reflect diffuse infectious process such as a typical pneumonia or viral pneumonia. Interstitial pulmonary edema although possible but less likely. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Reassessment of the patient after diuresis is recommended.
