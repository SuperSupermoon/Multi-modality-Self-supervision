Single portable view of the chest. The lungs are hyperinflated. Linear bibasilar opacities are seen most suggestive of atelectasis or scar. There is blunting of the costophrenic angles potentially due to technique and overlying soft tissues although small effusions are also possible. Superiorly, the lungs are clear of consolidation. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable in configuration. Calcifications along the left aspect of the mediastinum, atherosclerotic in nature. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
