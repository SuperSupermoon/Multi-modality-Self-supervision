A portable AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval improvement in the mild pulmonary edema. The upper mediastinum is less widened, suggesting reduction in central venous pressure. The heart size is still minimally enlarged, but less so than on the prior study. There is no pneumothorax. There is chronic atelectasis of the left lower lobe of the lung with possible small effusion at this location. The endotracheal tube terminates no less than 2 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube can be seen coursing into the stomach and inferiorly out of the field of view. A right PICC terminates in the low SVC.
