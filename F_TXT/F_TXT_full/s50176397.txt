Compared with the immediate prior study, the patient has undergone esophageal surgery. A small right apical pneumothorax is noted with a right-sided chest tube already in place. An enteric tube overlies the trachea for much of its course, but is shown more superiorly to be within the esophagus. The airway and ends within the gastroesophageal anastomosis. There is leftward tracheal deviation most likely due to postoperative swelling. A left paramidline drain is noted. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary vascular congestion. Allowing for rotation, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably within normal limits.
