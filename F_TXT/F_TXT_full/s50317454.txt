AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted. There is a single-lead pacer device projecting over the right chest wall with lead tip extending into the expected location of the right ventricle. The heart is moderately enlarged and there is diffuse ground-glass opacity in the lungs, likely reflecting mild pulmonary edema. No large effusions are evident. There is no pneumothorax. No focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. Mediastinal contour appears grossly unremarkable. Bony structures are intact.
