Heart size is moderately enlarged. The aorta is unfolded. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Mild upper zone vascular redistribution is present without overt pulmonary edema. Lung volumes are low with streaky opacities in the lung bases most likely reflective of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Comminuted fracture of the left proximal humerus is re- demonstrated.
