A large left pleural effusion appears slightly increased in size compared to the previous study. Cardiac and mediastinal contours unchanged. There is continued left basilar opacification likely reflective of compressive atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present. Patchy right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection is difficult to exclude. No right-sided focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. No acute osseous abnormality is present.
