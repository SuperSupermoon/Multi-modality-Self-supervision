Study is limited by underpenetration due to patient body habitus. Within this limitation, there are low lung volumes noted with crowding of bronchovascular markings. Bilateral opacifications likely represent dependent atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette appears mildly prominent which may be secondary to accentuation by low lung volumes.
