Exam is limited by marked could patient rotation and low lung volumes. These factors accentuate the cardiomediastinal contours, limiting assessment. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by persistent edema. At apparently new confluent opacity is seen in the periphery of the left lung base and may be due to a focal pleural and or parenchymal process in this region, but is difficult to assess in the setting of marked rotation. Repeat nonrotated radiograph would be helpful in this regard.
