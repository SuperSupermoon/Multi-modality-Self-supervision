As compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place with persistent large left pleural effusion. Small to moderate right pleural effusion has apparently slightly increased in size, and note is made of worsening pulmonary vascular congestion. No other relevant changes.
