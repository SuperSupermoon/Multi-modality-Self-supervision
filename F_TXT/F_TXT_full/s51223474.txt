A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. Medial bilateral lung base opacities may be due to aspiration, although underlying infection not excluded. There is a possible calcified right diaphragmatic plaque. The bilateral costophrenic angles are blunted. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is moderate. Multiple old right sided rib fractures are seen.
