Pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement suggest cardiac decompensation or volume overload but there is no pulmonary edema. Right pleural effusion is small if any. Heart size top-normal. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric drainage tube can be traced at least as far as the distal esophagus but the tip is not distinct. No pneumothorax.
