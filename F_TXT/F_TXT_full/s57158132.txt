Radiograph was obtained to assess for feeding tube placement. Tip of feeding tube terminates in the lower thoracic esophagus above the thoracoabdominal junction, as communicated by telephone with Dr. ___ on ___ at 10:17 a.m., at the time of discovery. There has been a slight further improvement in widespread alveolar opacities, probably reflecting pulmonary edema. Small pleural effusions are unchanged.
