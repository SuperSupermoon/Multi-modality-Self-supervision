Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. The left-sided pacemaker leads terminate in the expected location of right atrium and right ventricle. Cardiomegaly is moderate to severe. There is prominence of bilateral hila, most likely reflecting enlarged pulmonary arteries and might be consistent with pulmonary hypertension. The patient is in moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. Infectious process can be obscured and should be again reassessed after diuresis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present.
