There are small pleural effusions. Right base opacity is worrisome for pneumonia. Subtle left base opacity may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis although an additional site of consolidation is not excluded. There may be mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified.
