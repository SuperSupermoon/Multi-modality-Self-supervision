The heart size is normal. The aorta is mildly tortuous but unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise stable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Expansile lesion of the left ___ anterior rib is unchanged. Healing fracture of the right 10th rib is again demonstrated. Known compression deformity of an upper thoracic vertebral body is not well assessed on this single AP supine view.
