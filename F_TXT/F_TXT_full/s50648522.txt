Semi-erect single portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable moderate cardiomegaly. Mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable. Hila appear somewhat enlarged possibly due to vessel engorgment, but perception of asymmetric increase of the right hilus is largely due to patient rotation. There is a significant elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, unchanged compared to ___ with associated atelectasis. Minimal atelectasis is also noted on the left. There is diffuse slightly prominent interstitium which is likely due to chronic lung changes. No pneumothorax identified. Likely small left pleural effusion.
