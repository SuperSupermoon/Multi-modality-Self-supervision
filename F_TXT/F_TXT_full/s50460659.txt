Compared to the prior study, the lung volumes are lower. There is mild pulmonary vascular re-distribution and increased opacities at both bases. It is unclear if the opacities at the bases are due to volume loss or infiltrate. Compared to the prior study, the appearance of the lower lobes is slightly worse.
