Again seen is an ET tube which terminates 3.8 cm above the carina. There is stable position of right-sided PICC line whose distal tip projects over the low SVC versus cavoatrial junction. There is leftward rotation on the current radiograph. There is unchanged scoliosis of the thoracic spine. Again seen are age-related calcification of the bronchial tree. There is a tortuous and calcified thoracic aorta. There is essentially stable appearance of mild to moderate pulmonary edema with prominent central component, more notable on the left on the current radiograph, which likely represent development of asymmetric pulmonary edema, however infection cannot be fully excluded. Recommend repeat imaging after diuresis. There is unchanged retrocardiac opacification which obscures the left hemidiaphragm, representing either atelectasis or infectious consolidation. There is a stable small layering right pleural effusion. There is no apparent left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
