There are numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic disease. There is an increasing right pleural effusion and increasing consolidation at the right base which may reflect compressive lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. A right internal jugular Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely not changed although difficult to assess due to the diffuse pulmonary metastases.
