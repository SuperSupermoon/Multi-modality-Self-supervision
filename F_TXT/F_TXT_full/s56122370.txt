Endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating approximately 2.2 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm and into the stomach. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Apparent widening of the mediastinum is likely due to low lung volumes and supine patient positioning. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
