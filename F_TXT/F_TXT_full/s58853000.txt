There has been interval placement of a left-sided pigtail catheter, which appears coiled overlying the left lower lobe. A left side hydropneumothorax with adjacent atelectasis has decreased in size, now moderate. The upper left lung and right lung are grossly clear. There is no evidence of large pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is incompletely visualized secondary to the pleural effusion, but appears grossly unchanged from the prior examination. Asymmetric opacity overlying the first costochondral joint, may be degenerative versus overlying lung nodule.
