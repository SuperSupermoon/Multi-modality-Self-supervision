Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion has slightly improved with resolving interstitial edema. Multifocal consolidation in the right lung appears slightly worse, particularly in the right lower lobe and note is made of possible cavitation in the right perihilar consolidation. Right pigtail pleural catheter has apparently changed in position to a more lateral location, and note is made of increasing right pleural effusion, now small to moderate in size. No visible pneumothorax.
