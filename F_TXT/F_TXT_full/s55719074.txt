The patient is intubated with an endotracheal tube terminating at the thoracic inlet. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach where it makes a single coil. There is mild gaseous distention of the stomach. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear within normal limits. The lungs appear clear. The extreme right costophrenic angle is partly excluded but there is no evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
