As compared to the previous radiograph, the post-operative changes at the level of the right upper lobe have decreased in extent. At the lower aspects of the right lung, there is unchanged evidence of atelectasis, combined with a hyperlucent area at the bases that might reflect a post-operative pneumothorax. No evidence of tension is present. The appearance of the left lung and of the post-operative mediastinum is unchanged. No changes in appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
