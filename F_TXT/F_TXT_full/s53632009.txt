Previously visualized right-sided pigtail catheter has since been removed. There are now 2 right-sided chest tubes. Left PICC with tip in the mid SVC. Again visualized is a right basilar hydropneumothorax along with a small apical pneumothrax. The gasseous portion of the basilar hydropneumothorax appears minimally increased. Right lower lobe and middle lobe opacities appear stable. Cardiomediastinal contour remains unchanged.
