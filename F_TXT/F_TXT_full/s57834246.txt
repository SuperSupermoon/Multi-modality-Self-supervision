As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated. The lung volumes remain comparable to the previous exam. However, a relatively extensive diffuse opacity with air bronchograms has newly appeared on the right. The right costophrenic sinus is blunted, so that the presence of a right pleural effusion must be suspected. The size of the cardiac silhouette is slightly increased. Also increased is the diameter of the azygos vein, so that unilateral pulmonary edema is the most likely diagnosis. No left pleural effusion on today's radiograph. Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Borderline diameter of the heart.
