Right hemidiaphragm may be elevated and right lower lobe is still substantially atelectatic and there could be a moderate residual of right pleural effusion, following VATS and placement of 2 right pleural drains. There is no appreciable pneumothorax. Moderate volume of left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened and there is a tiny left pleural effusion, probably clinically insignificant. Heart is mildly enlarged.
