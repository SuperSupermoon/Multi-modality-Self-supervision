A tracheostomy is in-situ, unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study. A left subclavian catheter is also unchanged in appearance. Lung volumes are within normal limits. A hazy opacity in the left lung likely reflects a layering pleural effusion. A nasoenteric tube terminates in the stomach. No pneumothorax seen.
