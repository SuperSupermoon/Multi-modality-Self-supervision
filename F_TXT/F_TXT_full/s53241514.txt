The left chest tube is unchanged in positioning. The size and distribution of the moderate-sized loculated left pleural effusion is unchanged. The right lung is clear. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The upper mediastinum is stable in size, however the cardiac silhouette cannot be entirely evaluated due to the pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The linear radiodensity projecting over the left mid lung is likely external to the patient.
