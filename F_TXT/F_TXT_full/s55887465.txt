As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube is now seen over a normal course. The coiling in the pharynx, visible on the previous image, is no longer imaged. The tip of the nasogastric tube is not seen, the sidehole is approximately 7 cm below the gastroesophageal junction. The bases of the lungs and the size of the cardiac silhouette are constant in appearance.
