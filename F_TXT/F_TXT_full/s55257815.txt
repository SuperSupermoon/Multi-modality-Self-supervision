Lung volumes are low. The heart size is mildly enlarged, but accentuated due to low lung volumes. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema. Streaky and linear opacities in the lung bases are compatible with areas of atelectasis. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests a small left pleural effusion, unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
