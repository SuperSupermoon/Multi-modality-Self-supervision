Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior study. A moderate left pleural effusion is unchanged. A left-sided PICC line is extrathoracic and projects over the left axilla. Unchanged consolidation in the left upper lobe obscures aortic knob and is likely pneumonia. The right lung is clear. A tiny right pleural effusion is unchanged. The heart size is normal.
