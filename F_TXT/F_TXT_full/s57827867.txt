Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. Patchy opacities are again demonstrated at both lung bases, improved on the left and slightly worse on the right. This may reflect patchy atelectasis, and less likely aspiration or infectious pneumonia. A linear focus of atelectasis in the mid lung region on the left is similar to the prior study. Small right pleural effusion is present, but there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
