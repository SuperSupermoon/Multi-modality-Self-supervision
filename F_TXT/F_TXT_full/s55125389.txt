A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right jugular central catheter with the tip in the low SVC, and a nasogastric tube which extends at least into the stomach. The right pneumothorax now has a subpulmonic component, and appears slightly larger, although this may simply be due to changes in positioning. A moderate left pleural effusion, left lower lobe consolidation, and cardiomegaly are unchanged.
