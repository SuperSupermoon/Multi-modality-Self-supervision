Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm and is visualized at least to the distal stomach, but the tip is outside of the field of view of this image. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Improvement in left lower lobe opacity is demonstrated but a subtle heterogeneous opacity is developing within the right lower lobe. Upper lobe predominant emphysema is again demonstrated.
