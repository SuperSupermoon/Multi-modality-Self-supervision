There has been no interval change from the previous exam. Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated, and the mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Emphysematous changes are noted with patchy and linear opacities in the lung bases, more so on the left, also similar to the prior exam. Cavitary right upper lobe lesion is again visualized. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
