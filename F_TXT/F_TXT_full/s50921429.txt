The patient is severely rotated to the right, leading to unfolding of the mediastinum. Allowing for differences in patient positioning, there has been no significant change as compared to the prior examination. A dual lead pacemaker is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. The lung volumes remain low, resulting in the appearance of pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis and a small right pleural effusion are present. There is no evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
