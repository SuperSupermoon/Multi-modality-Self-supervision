AP portable supine view of the chest. Dual lead pacer is noted with pacer pack projecting over the left chest wall and leads extending to the region of the right atrium and right ventricle. Predominately left-sided calcified pleural plaque is noted likely accounting for the opacity projecting over the lateral aspect of the left lower lung. Evaluation for a subtle pneumonia in this area is therefore limited. Otherwise, no signs of pneumonia. No supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. Chronic right rib deformities are noted involving the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs.
