No significant interval change compared to ___. The patient is status post right upper lobe lobectomy with unchanged right apical air collection and diffuse subcutaneous air collections. A right-sided chest tube is in standard position. There are stable bilateral areas of atelectasis at the lung bases. There is slightly increased left sided mediastinal shift compared to the prior examination which likely reflects a combination of stable right apical air collection but slightly increased left pleural lower lobe atelectasis compared to the prior examination.
