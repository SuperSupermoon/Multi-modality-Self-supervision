Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding. The heart is markedly enlarged, which is exacerbated by supine positioning. Small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis appears have increased slightly over the interval, which also may be in part due to positioning. Left basilar atelectasis is slightly improved. A left-sided pleural drainage catheter is present. A left-sided subclavian central venous line ends in the mid SVC. The nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view. The endotracheal tube ends 4.2 cm from the carina. No pneumothorax. Multiple left-sided rib fractures are again seen.
