Interval removal of the endotracheal tube, right internal jugular central line, nasogastric tube, bibasilar chest tubes and mediastinal drains. Lung volumes have diminished and there are patchy bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, which may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. Stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy for CABG. No pneumothorax is seen, although the patient's position is not indicated on the current study and therefore the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax may be diminished especially if the patient was imaged in the supine or semi-erect position. Followup imaging is recommended. There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no overt pulmonary edema.
