1. Interval extubation, removal of the nasogastric tube, removal of chest and mediastinal drains and the right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with the introducer remaining in place. There is widening of the mediastinum which likely reflects a combination of the fact that the patient is recently post-operative and patient rotation on the current study. An area of opacity in the right mid lung likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. There is increasing patchy opacity at the left base with a more consolidative appearance in the retrocardiac area suggestive of worsening partial lobar atelectasis. There is also probable mild interstitial edema. No large effusions are appreciated. No pneumothorax is appreciated. The stomach is distended with gas. Multiple skin ___ are seen along the left lateral thorax in this patient status post recent thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.
