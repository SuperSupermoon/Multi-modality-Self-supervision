Single AP view of the chest was reviewed. The heart is moderately enlarged. Interstitial edema is mild. Focal opacities at the lung bases, left greater than right, is likely combination of edema, small pleural effusion and atelectasis, but opacities in the left midlung zone could be due to recent aspiration, pneumonia, or pulmonary hemorrhage. Incidental note is made of an azygous fissure. No pneumothorax is present.
