The lung volumes are low. The mediastinal, hilar and cardiac contours appear unchanged. There is persistent relative volume loss in the right hemithorax with opacity about the apex of the right lung suggesting a small pleural effusion. Patchy right basilar opacity suggests atelectasis. Atelectasis is potentially more extensive than explicitly demonstrated noting volume loss and slight rightward shift of mediastinal structures. Partly visualized spinal hardware at the thoracolumbar junction shows no definite change.
