As compared to chest radiograph from the same day, overall no substantial change of the right lung. Slight improvement in the left lung. ETT is 3 cm from the carina. The tip of the nasogastric tube in the stomach, partially beyond view of this chest radiograph. Mild pulmonary edema and moderate bilateral effusions unchanged. Persistent lower lobe opacities likely reflect atelectasis and effusions. No pneumothorax.
