Rotated positioning. Again seen is the tracheostomy tube. Compared with ___, there is new patchy opacity at the base of the right upper zone and at the right lung base, with less pronounced patchy opacity extending toward the right lung apex. There is pleural fluid and/or thickening in the right costophrenic angle and extending along the right chest wall, that is similar to the prior study. In addition, there is new thickening of the right minor fissure which could represent pleural fluid extending along the minor fissure. As before, the right hemidiaphragm is likely elevated. Allowing for rotation, the mediastinum remains grossly midline. The mediastinum appears prominent, though this is likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes and rotation. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal. In the left lung, there is minimal upper zone redistribution and minimal atelectasis linear atelectasis/scarring at the left lung base. The extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film, but no gross left effusion is identified. There is background osteopenia. Incidental note is made of severe left glenohumeral osteoarthritis.
