Right pleural catheters remain in place, with residual very small right apical lateral pneumothorax, and probable additional small loculated hydropneumothoraces at the right lung base adjacent to a persistent small right pleural effusion. Small left pleural effusion has slightly increased in size with persistent adjacent left basilar atelectasis.
