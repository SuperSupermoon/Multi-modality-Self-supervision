Lung volumes are low. Linear atelectasis in the bilateral mid lungs is unchanged. Bibasilar atelectasis is increased. Heart size is top-normal. Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are unremarkable. An enteric tube terminates within the gastric body, but with a side port near the level of the GE junction. Area of homogeneous increased opacity with straight, linear images projecting over the right lung is likely artifactual.
