An endotracheal tube terminates about 5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device has leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. The heart is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified. The chest appears hyperinflated. A small calcification projecting along the left mid lung suggests a granuloma, but otherwise the lungs appear clear. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
