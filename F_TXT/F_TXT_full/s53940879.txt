There is moderate interstitial pulmonary edema; concurrent pneumonia, particularly in the right lower lobe, is not excluded. The heart is moderately enlarged, increased in size compared to the prior radiograph from ___. A 1.8 x 1.4 cm nodular opacity projecting over the left retrocardiac region just medial to two surgical clips could be a pulmonary nodule or pleural calcification. A curvilinear radiodense structure paralleling the right hemidiaphragm may also be pleural calcification. There are no definite pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. The mediastinal contours are normal.
