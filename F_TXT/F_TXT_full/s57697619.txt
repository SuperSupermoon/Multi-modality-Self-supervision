In comparison with the study of ___, there are increased areas of opacification at the right base and left mid and lower lung zones. Preservation of pulmonary markings throughout these regions suggests that much of this could reflect layering pleural effusions, though some element of pneumonia or atelectasis may well be present. If clinically warranted, decubitus views might be helpful and a lateral view would be of value if the condition of the patient permits.
