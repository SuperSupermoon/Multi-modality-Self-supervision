As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The lung volumes remain low and areas of atelectasis are seen at both lung bases. The morphology of the changes is suggestive of atelectatic lesions rather than of pneumonia. No new parenchymal opacities. Moderate cardiomegaly with minimal fluid overload. Overinflation of the stomach that could be alleviated with the nasogastric tube. Known left partial shoulder replacement and advanced destructive changes at the level of the right shoulder.
