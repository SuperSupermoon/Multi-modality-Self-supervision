AP chest compared to ___ through ___: The acceleration of the global infiltrative pulmonary abnormality in the right lung between ___ and ___ has now been matched in the left lung. As such, pneumonia, pulmonary edema and hemorrhage need to be considered. If this were simply acceleration of pulmonary fibrosis, which can certainly be very rapid, that would have been more likely to be more symmetric. Since the process is accompanied by small bilateral pleural effusions, even though there has been no change in heart size, I think it is edema.
