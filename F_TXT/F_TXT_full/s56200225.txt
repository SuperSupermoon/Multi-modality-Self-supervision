There is little interval change from the prior study. A moderate-to-large right pleural effusion appears unchanged. There is continued right basilar and perihilar opacification representing a combination of patient's known malignancy and collapse of the right middle and lower lobes. Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. The cardiac, mediastinal and left hilar contours are unchanged. Left lung is grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax. Right-sided rib deformities are unchanged.
