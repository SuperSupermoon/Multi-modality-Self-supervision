Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There may be minimal pulmonary vascular congestion. Minimal left base linear atelectasis/scarring is seen. No definite discrete focal consolidation. Slight blunting of the costophrenic angles most likely relates to overlying soft tissue. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes. The superior mediastinum appears slightly prominent, but with clear margins, most likely related to supine, AP technique and low lung volumes. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. A stent is seen projecting over the right upper quadrant. It appears slightly different in location as compared to the study earlier the same date. However, appears similar in appearance as compared to ___.
