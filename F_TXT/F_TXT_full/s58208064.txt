The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates 1.5 cm above the carina. An introducer catheter terminates in the upper superior vena cava. An endoscope passes through the whole esophagus and imaged upper part of the stomach. No inflated balloon is visualized. The lung volumes are low. The heart shows a left ventricular configuration, as before. There is new retrocardiac opacification which is very commonly due to atelectasis. Coinciding small pleural effusion is not excluded on the left. None is demonstrated on the right side. Perihilar opacity suggests mild fluid overload.
