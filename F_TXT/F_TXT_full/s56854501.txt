Single portable view of the chest compared to previous exam from ___. Right PICC is again seen with tip in the upper SVC. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is again seen, with adjacent linear opacity. Findings are suggestive of either pleural scarring/fluid with adjacent atelectasis/scarring. Lungs are otherwise essentially clear. Cardiac silhouette is stable in configuration, as are the osseous and soft tissue structures notable for a left shoulder subluxation and lower cervical spinal fixation hardware.
