The cardiomediastinal shadow is unchanged. No airspace opacification. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. Mild density seen in the left costophrenic angle which may represent atelectasis or a small pleural effusion. Suture material projecting over the right hilar area. Narrowing of the subglottic trachea is probably due to recent intubation.
