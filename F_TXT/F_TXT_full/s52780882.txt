Portable frontal radiograph of the chest was obtained. The heart size and mediastinal contours are normal. There is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with the opacification at the left base which may reflect atelectasis; although, an underlying infectious process is possible. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
