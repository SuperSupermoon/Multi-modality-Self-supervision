INDICATION Low blood pressure. Congestive heart failure versus pneumonia. TECHNIQUE Chest, portable AP upright. COMPARISON Earlier on the same day. FINDINGS A dialysis catheter terminates in the uppermost right atrium. The heart is again enlarged. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is again a large right-sided pleural effusion with probable atelectasis of much of the right lower lung. A trace pleural effusion is not excluded on the left. Interstitial abnormality suggests mild to moderate pulmonary edema. IMPRESSION Bilateral pleural effusions. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema. WET READ Large right and small left pleural effusions with moderate pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly are unchanged from the prior examination.
