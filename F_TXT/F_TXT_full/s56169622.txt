AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiographs, ___: Extensive relatively homogeneous pulmonary opacification in the setting of chronic moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular and mediastinal venous engorgement is explained by edema. On the other hand, this could be noncardiogenic, diffuse alveolar damage, with or without a component of pulmonary hemorrhage. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial. No pneumothorax.
