Vertebral stabilization devices and midline surgical clips are redemonstrated, obscuring fine detail. There has been interval removal of the endotracheal and esophageal tubes. The right-sided subclavian line ends at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged. A layered left sided effusion is again seen with some fluid tracking along the minor fissure. The overall decrease in right hemithorax opacification may be secondary to decreased effusion versus different patient obliquity during imaging. A mild hazinness of the left lower lung field is suggestive of a small layering left sided effusion. A dense retrocardiac opacity represents postoperative atelectasis, unchanged. There are no focal pulmonary opacities concerning for pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. Of note, there is increased widening of the upper and mid mediastinum along its right margin. Cardiac contour is stable.
