In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration. There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Bibasilar opacification is consistent with substantial right pleural effusion and small left effusion with compressive atelectasis at the bases. Monitoring and support devices remain in place, with the right PICC line barely extending into the right hemithorax.
