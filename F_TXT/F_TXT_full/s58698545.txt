AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 11 hours earlier during the same day. The right-sided post-operative findings with the density in the apical area and sizable effusions obliterating the right-sided diaphragmatic contour and extending along the right lateral wall remain rather unchanged. Also, the left-sided pleural effusion is still seen although much less comparison with the right-sided effusion. Observe that the patient is slightly rotated towards the left in comparison with the preceding study but otherwise the findings are stable. No pneumothorax has developed.
