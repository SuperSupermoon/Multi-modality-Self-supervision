Right-sided chest tube has been slightly repositioned, but continues to have a focal bend at the level of the side port. A small right apical pneumothorax is present at the level of the right third posterior rib. Exam is otherwise remarkable for slight worsening of diffuse airspace opacities in the right lung likely due to pulmonary contusion, with a component of pulmonary laceration in the right mid and lower lung as seen to better detail on recent CT. Extensive right-sided rib fractures consistent with flail chest, as well as right apical capping, subcutaneous emphysema, right clavicular and scapular fractures are unchanged since the recent exam.
