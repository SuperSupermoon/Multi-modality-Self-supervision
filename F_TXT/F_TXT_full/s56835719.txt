Rotated positioning. Compared with ___, there has been progressive opacification of the left lung, now with only a small residual area of aerated lung seen at the left lung apex. There is probable slight shift of mediastinum to the left, similar to prior. Appearance is not fully characterized, but suggests the presence of a large effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. The left hemidiaphragm could be elevated. Right lung is grossly clear, without focal infiltrate or effusion. Atelectasis noted in the right cardiophrenic region. There is slight upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. As before, the patient 's left elbow is flexed, with the hand overlying the lateral edge of the upper left chest.
