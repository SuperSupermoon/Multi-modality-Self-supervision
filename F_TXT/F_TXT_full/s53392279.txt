Yesterday's pulmonary edema has improved substantially. Nodular areas of consolidation and frankly cavitating septic emboli are no better than on ___ preceding the edema. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is stable. Pleural effusions are small if any. A left PIC line ends in the low SVC and esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
