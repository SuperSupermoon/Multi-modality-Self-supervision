Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The cardiac silhouette remains massively enlarged, similar to prior. Mediastinal contours are stable. There is slight increase in interstitial markings in the left greater than right perihilar regions which may be due to pulmonary edema, slightly asymmetric; superimposed infectious process is not entirely excluded. There is no pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. No displaced fracture is seen.
