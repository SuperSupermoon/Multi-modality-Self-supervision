In comparison to the most recent prior study, there is increased opacification in the medial right lung base which may represent an early developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context but could also represent atelectasis. A large left juxtahilar mass is unchanged, corresponding to the patient's biopsy-proven small cell carcinoma, better characterized on recent CT of the chest. Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are present. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size but stable. The thoracic aorta is tortuous. The trachea is midline.
