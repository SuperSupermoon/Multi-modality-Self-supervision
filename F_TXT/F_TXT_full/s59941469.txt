The feeding tube now has its tip projecting over the stomach. A right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. The right lung remains low in volume with streaky opacities at the base suggestive of atelectasis or scarring. More scattered opacities throughout the left lung, but slightly more prominent at the base, are stable either reflecting atelectasis or aspiration pneumonia. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.
