AP chest compared to ___: Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion remains following thoracentesis and aspiration of the majority of the left pleural fluid. Left hemidiaphragm is elevated, significance uncertain, but raising possibility of either primary atelectasis in the left lower lobe or pleural restriction, since there seems to be a posterior loculation of residual pleural fluid as well. Mild interstitial edema which developed on ___ has improved, but there is a suggestion of a new region of consolidation at the right apex. I would strongly recommend conventional radiographs as soon as feasible. Heart is moderately enlarged, its size exaggerated by difference in patient positioning and technique.
