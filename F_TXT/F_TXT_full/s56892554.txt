ETT terminates 4.6 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube is seen courseing below the diaphragm, terminating in the proximal stomach. There is prominence of the right hilum with suggestion of retraction seen. There is also opacity projecting over the right lung apex, as was also the case on the prior study. There appears to be volume loss in the right lung with elevation of the right hemidiaphragm as well. Areas of opacity in the right mid to lower lung appear somewhat increased and there is suggestion of right perihilar air bronchograms. There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which may be due to trace effusion or pleural thickening. The left lung is clear. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
