Since the prior exam, the pulmonary edema has improved, and is now mild. Bibasilar atelectasis, more pronounced on the left than the right, is not significantly changed. There is no new opacity to suggest pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Calcifications are noted at the aortic arch. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is no free air below the hemidiaphragms.
