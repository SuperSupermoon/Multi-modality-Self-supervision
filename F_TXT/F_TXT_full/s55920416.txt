AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained. Lateral inferior aspect of the right CP angle is excluded. Low lung volumes limits evaluation, though allowing for this, the lungs appear clear without focal consolidation, large effusion, or pneumothorax. No definite signs of pulmonary edema or overt CHF. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears essentially unchanged with a slightly unfolded thoracic aorta. Bony structures appear intact.
