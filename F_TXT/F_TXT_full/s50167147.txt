Again seen is the small right apical pneumothorax. This is similar in size compared to films from the prior evening. Cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular redistribution, and bilateral pleural effusions are again seen. There are bilateral lower lobe areas of volume loss/infiltrate marrow that are slightly more prominent on the current film. The feeding tube tip is off the film. The right subclavian line with tip at the cavoatrial junction is unchanged.
