The right PICC has been retracted with the tip terminating in the low SVC. A tracheostomy tube is in place with the tip projecting over the trachea although the internal portion appears horizontal. The inspiratory lung volumes remain very low. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and the mediastinal contours are stably widened. There is persistent pulmonary vascular engorgement with mild pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacification in the setting of low lung volumes most likely reflects moderate atelectasis. The right costophrenic angle is clear. The left costophrenic angle is blunted and may represent a small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is present.
