Asymmetrically distributed combined alveolar and interstitial opacities have slightly improved in the interval. Although such rapid improvement suggests an acute process such as pulmonary edema, coexisting infection is possible, particularly in the left perihilar region. Additionally, the coarseness of the interstitial opacities raises concern for underlying chronic interstitial process. If this pattern fails to resolve radiographically, high-resolution chest CT may be helpful for more complete characterization if warranted clinically.
