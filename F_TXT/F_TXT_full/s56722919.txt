In comparison with study of ___, there is again hazy opacification in the left hemithorax silhouetting the hemidiaphragm. This is consistent with a left pleural effusion and regions of volume loss in the left lower lobe. Differences in patient's position make it difficult to compare the degree of effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. There is a band of atelectasis at the right base. The right heart border is sharply seen on the current study. However, in view of the extreme lordotic position of the patient, this could obscure a possible atelectasis or volume loss in the region of the middle lobe.
