In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased prominence of the cardiac silhouette with engorgement of poorly defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with progressive pulmonary edema. Obscuration of the hemidiaphragms is consistent with pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. In view of the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be extremely difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view. Incidental note is stable scoliosis of the thoracic spine convex to the right.
