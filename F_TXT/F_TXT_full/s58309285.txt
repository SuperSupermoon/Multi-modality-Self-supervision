A single supine chest radiograph was obtained. An endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the lower SVC. An enteric catheter terminates in the body of the stomach. Lung volumes are low. There is bibasilar atelectasis. A left pleural effusion obscures the left hemidiaphragm. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal, however the left cardiac border is particularly sharp.
