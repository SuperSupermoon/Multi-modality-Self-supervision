The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiovascular surgery. Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed with residual right internal jugular vascular sheath in place, and no visible pneumothorax on the semi-upright study. Other indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in place, including an endotracheal tube that terminates about 6.5 cm above the carina. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by mild perihilar edema. Improved aeration at left lung base with residual atelectasis and small effusion remaining.
