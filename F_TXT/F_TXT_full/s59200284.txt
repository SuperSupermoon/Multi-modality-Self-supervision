AP chest compared to ___: Left basal pleural tube in place, no pneumothorax, decrease in the thickness of the left pleural margin at least inferiorly probably due to drainage of previous hemothorax. Marked displacement of rib fractures in the upper chest is noted, and may have implications regarding continued vascular trauma. Cardiomediastinal silhouette shows only mild vascular engorgement unchanged. Right lung is generally low in volume. There is no edema. Atelectasis at the left lung base is moderate-to-severe but unchanged.
