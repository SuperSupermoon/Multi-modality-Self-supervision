Current AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates right perihilar opacity, most likely representing known cancer potentially after radiation treatment. There is tenting of the right hemidiaphragm most likely related to volume loss or small amount of right pleural effusion. No definitive consolidation separate from the perihilar opacity is seen to suggest pneumonia. No pneumothorax is seen. Left lung is essentially clear.
