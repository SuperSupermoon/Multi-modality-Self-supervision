Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent collapse of the remaining portions of the right lung with stable large right pneumothorax and moderate pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Interval increase in the engorgement of pulmonary vessels in the left lung may represent high flow state. No left-sided pleural effusion.
