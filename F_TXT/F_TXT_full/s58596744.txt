There has been interval placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter pleural drain, with subsequent decrease in size of right apical pneumothorax, which is now small. The previously nondisplaced fracture of the posterior right seventh rib is now moderately displaced. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
