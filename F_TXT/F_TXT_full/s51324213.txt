The lungs are clear without confluent consolidation or large effusion. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is noted, likely in part due to prominent mediastinal fat. Enlarged left hilum is again seen, presumably due to enlargement of the pulmonary artery in the setting of pulmonary hypertension although possibility of adenopathy is not excluded. No acute osseous abnormalities. Enteric tube seen passing the on the GE junction, tip not definitively identified. No free air below the diaphragm.
