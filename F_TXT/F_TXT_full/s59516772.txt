The pneumomediastinum present on the prior chest x-ray has decreased in size though still present. The position of the two lines is unchanged. Left hemidiaphragm is somewhat obscured, and some atelectasis at the left base is probably present. The right pneumatocele is again noted. No failure is identified.
