There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube, which terminates just below the gastroesophageal junction, but the distal side hole port remains within the distal esophagus. There is no subdiaphragmatic free air. Numerous upper abdominal surgical clips are again noted. The appearance of the chest is otherwise unchanged compared to the prior study from 17:10 earlier today.
