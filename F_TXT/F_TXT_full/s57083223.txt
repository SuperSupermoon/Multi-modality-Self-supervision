An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.2 cm above the carina. An orogastric-type tube is present. Due to underpenetration, it can only be traced to the lowermost portion of the mediastinum, though it may extend inferior to that. A left IJ central line is present, tip over proximal SVC. A right IJ sheath is present, tip overlying the lower right brachiocephalic vessel. There are low inspiratory volumes, with prominence of the mediastinum, upper zone redistribution, and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Small effusions cannot be excluded. Mediastinal and CHF findings are similar to the film from ___. Pulmonary vascular plethora may also be accentuated by supine technique. The appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by rotated positioning.
