In comparison with the study of ___, the right PICC line and endotracheal tube have been removed. Otherwise, little change and no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. The tip of the endotracheal tube is in the mid to lower stomach, with the side port just distal to the esophagogastric junction. Pushing the tube forward an additional 5 cm would result in more optimal placement.
