The tip of the endotracheal tube projects over the mid thoracic trachea. A feeding tube extends into the stomach. The tip of the left internal jugular central venous catheter projects over the mid SVC. The lungs are markedly hyperexpanded. There are persisting but decreased left lower lung zone patchy opacities. Blunting of both costophrenic angles are noted which may reflect small bilateral pleural effusions or pleural thickening. No pneumothorax identified. The size the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
