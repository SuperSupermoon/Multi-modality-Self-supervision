Left subclavian PICC line and right pleural catheter remain in place. Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Aorta is calcified and unfolded consistent with atherosclerosis. The cardiac contour is difficult to assess due to patient rotation on the current study. Bibasilar patchy opacities with associated small effusions are again seen. There has been interval appearance of mild perihilar edema. Several right-sided rib fractures are again identified. No large pneumothorax appreciated.
