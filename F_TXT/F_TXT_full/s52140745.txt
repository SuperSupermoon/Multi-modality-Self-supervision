As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube is unchanged. Unchanged TIPS and calcified pleural plaques, noatvbly at the right lung bases. Unchanged bilateral basal parenchymal opacities, most likely atelectatic in nature. No pleural effusions. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without signs of fluid overload. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
