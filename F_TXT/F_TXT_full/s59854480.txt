The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased. The lungs demonstrate slight prominence of the interstitial lung markings and nodular opacities predominantly in the right lung base with ill-defined opacities in the bilateral lung apices, which is concerning for an infectious process. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The trachea is midline. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
