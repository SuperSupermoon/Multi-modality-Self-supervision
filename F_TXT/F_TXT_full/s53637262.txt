There are low lung volumes which limits the assessment of the lung bases. There is likely mild bibasilar atelectasis. Heart size is difficult to assess, but likely within normal limits. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is present. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
