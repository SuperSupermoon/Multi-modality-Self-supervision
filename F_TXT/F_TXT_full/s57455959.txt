No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen. No pleural effusion is identified, though the extreme left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. No pneumothorax or overt pulmonary edema is seen though there is vascular engorgement suggestive of some volume overload. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Note is made of a cervical collar projecting over the upper portions of the lungs and mediastinum. A known cervical spine fracture and known osseous spinal lesions are not well evaluated on this examination.
