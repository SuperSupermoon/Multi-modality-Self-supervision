Single portable AP radiograph is compared to multiple prior studies. Patient is status post median sternotomy with wires which appear intact. Clips are noted along the left mediastinal and cardiac border. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Linear opacity projecting over the left upper lung zone corresponds to a focal area of scarring and fibrosis with traction bronchiectasis as shown on CT dated ___. Relative to prior chest radiograph dated ___, lungs are similar in appearance. Interstitial and airspace opacities may reflect substantial vascular congestion. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
