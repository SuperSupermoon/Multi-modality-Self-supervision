AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next two preceding portable chest examinations obtained earlier during the same day. The position of the ETT has changed as much as the tip now its position in the trachea 4 cm above the level of the carina. On the other hand, a new line is overlying the trachea which was not seen on the previous image. This line happens to overlie the ___ the tracheal cannula and continues into the airway, passing at the carina into the right bronchial area and later on to meander in the mediastinal area. It is most likely representing a neuro stimulator wire located either on the back or frontal of the thorax. This finding, however, requires an explanation, cannot be evaluated conclusively by a single chest examination. On the present image, a plate atelectases is seen on the left base which was not present on previous examination obtained six hours earlier. There is no evidence of pneumothorax on either side in the apical area. An NG tube reaches well into the stomach, as before. Telephone contact was established with referring physician, ___. ___ at 2:55 p.m. It was agreed that the confusing linear artifacts described were related to external lines superimposed on the image. It was also agreed upon that the ETT now terminated in the trachea 4 cm above the level of the carina and no pneumothorax was present.
