Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs are well expanded and clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinal contours are unremarkable with unchanged enlargement of right hilar consistent with known calcified lymph nodes. Amorphic density along the right humeral head suggests calcific tendinitis.
