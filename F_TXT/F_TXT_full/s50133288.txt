Semi erect frontal portable chest radiograph shows stable chronic severe cardiomegaly. The lungs are grossly clear. No evidence of pneumothorax. A transvenous left subclavian pacer is identified with its tip in standard position. A Swan-Ganz catheter is in place with its tip projecting over the proximal right pulmonary artery. There is an ill defined opacity which projects above the right hilum and possibly corresponds to opacity identified on Chest CT dated ___ and partially seen on CT dated ___. Would recommend repeat CT to exlude possibility that this may represent neoplastic lesion.
