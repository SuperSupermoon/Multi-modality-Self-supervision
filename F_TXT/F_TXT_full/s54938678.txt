The small left apical pneumothorax is new or newly apparent without signs of tension. A left basal pigtail pleural drain reaches the midline, unchanged.

A hollow viscus in the left upper quadrant distended with non solid contents could be stomach or splenic flexure. Unchanged left rib fractures, again identified.
