The patient has been extubated, and NG tube has been removed. Improved pulmonary edema is now mild. Left lower lobe consolidation which could reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or small pleural effusion is stable. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac contour is enlarged in this patient with chronically distended pulmonary arteries which reflects pulmonary arterial hypertension.
