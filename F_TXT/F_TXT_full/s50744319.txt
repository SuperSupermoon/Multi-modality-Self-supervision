The patient is rotated with respect to the film. Lung volumes are low and the left hemidiaphragm is markedly elevated, similar to prior. Cardiomediastinal contours appear stable. Indistinct appearance of the pulmonary vascular markings is compatible with mild interstitial edema. No focal consolidation, substantial pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. No radiopaque foreign body.
