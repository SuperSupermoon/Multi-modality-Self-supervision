There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube is seen terminating in the right mid lung field. The right lung has almost completely reexpanded, and there is only a small residual apical right pneumothorax without evidence of tension physiology. Subcutaneous emphysema is seen in the soft tissues along the lateral right thorax. Several regions of patchy airspace opacities within the right middle and lower lobes may represent atelectasis versus post-reexpansion edema. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Redemonstrated is an endotracheal tube terminating 6.8 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing out of view of the radiograph.
