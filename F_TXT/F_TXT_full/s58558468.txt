AP chest compared to 7:47 a.m.: ET tube is in standard placement, but the diameter of the tube, 10 mm, is small relative to the tracheal diameter, 27 mm. Clinical evaluation recommended. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions obscure much of the lungs in this supine view. I suspect pulmonary edema has improved slightly, but I cannot be sure. There is still substantial atelectasis at the lung bases, and the heart remains mildly to moderately enlarge. New left internal jugular line ends in the midline, probably in the left brachiocephalic vein. An upper elementary tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
