The lungs are clear except for minimal atelectasis at the right lung base. A left-sided PICC line still ends at the junction of brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The stomach is moderately distended. The aorta is tortuous and dilated as shown on recent CT.
