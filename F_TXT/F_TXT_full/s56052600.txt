In comparison with the study of ___, there is an endotracheal tube in place with its tip at the clavicular level, approximately 7 cm above the carina. Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Otherwise, little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Bibasilar opacification with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms is again consistent with a combination of layering pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis at the bases. Cardiac silhouette is stable and there is mild if any elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
