AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 10:27 p.m. The ET tube has been inserted, which is too low, approximately 13 mm above the carina and should be pulled back for about 2 cm. There is unchanged cardiomegaly, but bibasilar and perihilar opacities are new and might be consistent with areas of atelectasis. Aspiration in particular in the left lung base cannot be excluded. No appreciable pleural effusion is seen and there is no pneumothorax.
