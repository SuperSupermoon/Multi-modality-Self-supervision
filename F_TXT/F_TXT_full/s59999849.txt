Left subclavian PICC line now courses across the midline and heads cephalad in the proximal right brachiocephalic vein near its junction with the SVC. Repositioning would be recommended. However, it is noted that the patient was subsequently imaged on ___ at 10 am and on that study, the PICC line is now in satisfactory position. The left basilar opacity and associated small effusion are unchanged likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There is stable pulmonary vascular congestion. No pneumothorax is seen. The heart remains enlarged. Overall mediastinal contours are stable.
