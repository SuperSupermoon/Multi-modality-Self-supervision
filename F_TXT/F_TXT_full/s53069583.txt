AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Since ___ a second pleural pigtail catheter has been inserted projecting over the left lower hemithorax several centimeters above the indwelling catheter. From the frontal view alone I cannot tell whether there has been any drainage of the previous posteriorly loculated pleural effusion, because the lateral pleural margin remains thickened. Lungs are clear. Heart size is normal. Lateral view recommended when feasible.
