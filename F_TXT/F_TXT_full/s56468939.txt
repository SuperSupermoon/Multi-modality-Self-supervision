The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased from the most recent prior study. A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged with a single lead terminating in the right ventricle. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view with the tip terminating in the left upper quadrant likely within the gastric fundus. Mild central pulmonary vascular engorgement is unchanged from the most recent prior study. No significant pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is detected on this single frontal view. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. The mediastinal contours are prominent on the right, which is increased from the most recent prior study, but likely due in part to patient rotation and lower lung volumes. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
