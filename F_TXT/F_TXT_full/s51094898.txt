There is a stable small right apical and lateral pneumothorax. Three right-sided chest tubes remain in place. A left subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. The patient's mandible obscures part of the apices. The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. There is a stable layering left effusion with associated retrocardiac opacity which may represent lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. There is increasing perihilar vascular indistinctness suggestive of superimposed mild perihilar edema.
