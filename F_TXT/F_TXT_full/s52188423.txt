Semi-upright portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. The costophrenic angles are obscured, suggestive of trace pleural effusions. There is perihilar vascular congestion. Mediastinal silhouette is prominent. A large lucency projecting over cardiac silhouette, likely reflects patient's known hiatal hernia. Heart size is difficult to assess. There is no pneumothorax. Coronary artery stents are in place. Sternotomy wires appear intact. Splenic artery calcifications are noted. Otherwise, partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
