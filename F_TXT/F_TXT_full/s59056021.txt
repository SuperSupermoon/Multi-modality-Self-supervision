As compared to the previous image, the lung volumes have minimally increased. However, the very extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities are not substantially changed. Extensive pulmonary edema is still the most likely differential diagnosis. No pleural effusions. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
