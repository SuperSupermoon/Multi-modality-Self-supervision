There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax since the prior exam. The trachea appears slightly shifted to the right, suggesting that there is a large pleural effusion on the left side. Known left hilar mass with associated left upper lobe collapse also likely contributes to the white out within the left hemithorax. Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The right lung appears clear. No pneumothorax. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
