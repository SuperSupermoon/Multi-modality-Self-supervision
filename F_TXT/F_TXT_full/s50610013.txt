Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier. Mild pulmonary edema is minimally improved. ET tube is in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC. NG tube tip is in the stomach, the side port is just distal to the EG junction and can be advanced 5 cm for more standard position. Bibasilar atelectasis has improved, larger on the right side. No evident pneumothorax. Small bilateral effusions are unchanged.
