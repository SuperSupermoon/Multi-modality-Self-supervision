Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. There is no evident pneumothorax after removal of right chest tube. There are low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectases, have improved. Small bilateral pleural effusions are larger on the right side. Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum have improved. Multiple surgical clips project in the left upper quadrant. Lumbar hardware is partially imaged.
