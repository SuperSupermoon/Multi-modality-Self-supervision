Following removal of right internal jugular vascular catheter, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiovascular surgery with stable post-operative appearance of cardiomediastinal contours. Scattered septal lines are present bilaterally suggesting the presence of interstitial edema. Interval worsening of bibasilar atelectasis and slight increase in small bilateral pleural effusions. An incompletely marginated opacity at the level of the interspace of the first and second left anterior ribs appears slightly less prominent, and may potentially represent an area of resolving loculated fluid given its absence on the pre-operative radiograph.
