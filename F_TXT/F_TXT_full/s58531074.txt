Low lung volumes are present which results in crowding of bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests a trace left pleural effusion with associated left basilar atelectasis. Heart size is normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. No pneumothorax. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
