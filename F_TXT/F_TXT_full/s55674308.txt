There has been interval removal of the nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube. The left subclavian central line continues to have its tip in the mid SVC. The patient is status post median sternotomy. Given the patient's rotation on the current examination, evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is not possible. There does appear to be increasing airspace consolidation in the left mid and lower lung which could reflect combination of layering effusion with partial lower lobe atelectasis. There is increasing linear opacity at the right base as well suggestive of atelectasis. No pulmonary edema is appreciated. No pneumothorax is seen.
