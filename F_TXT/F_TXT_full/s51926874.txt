1. Right subclavian central line has its tip in the distal SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. An endotracheal tube has its tip proximally 2-3 cm above the carina, unchanged. Patchy opacities at both bases may reflect a component of atelectasis, but the lungs are otherwise clear. No pulmonary edema. No large effusions. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. If the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging with PA and lateral views may be helpful.
