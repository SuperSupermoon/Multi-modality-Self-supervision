Comparison is made to the prior study from ___. There has been placement of a nasogastric tube. The tip and side port are in the expected location of the fundus of the stomach. However, there is an extremely large hiatal hernia and diaphragmatic defect with extension of the stomach and colon into the lower chest. This causes crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings and atelectasis of the lung bases. The visualized upper portions of the lung field are clear. There are no pneumothoraces.
