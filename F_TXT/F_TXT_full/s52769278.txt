Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The patient is rotated which precludes precise assessment of the lungs. Within those limitations, the ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina. NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely terminating in the stomach. Left internal jugular line tip is at the junction of the brachiocephalic vein and SVC. There is left lower lobe consolidation that appears to be slightly progressed since the prior study and might reflect worsening infectious process. Minimal interstitial edema cannot be excluded. Small bilateral pleural effusion is most likely present. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
