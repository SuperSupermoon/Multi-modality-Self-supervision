Single portable AP upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates an enlarged heart, stable in appearance since prior radiograph dated 2 hr previously. There appears to be increased aeration in the right lower lung base. However, cephalization of vessels, diffuse patchy opacities and prominent pulmonary vasculature are consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Obscuration of the bilateral costophrenic angles is consistent with probable pleural effusions. Patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No acute osseous abnormalities are identified. Cervical spine fusion hardware is noted.
