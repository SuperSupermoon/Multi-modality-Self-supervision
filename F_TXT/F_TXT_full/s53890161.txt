The left pigtail pleural drainage catheter has been repositioned and nearly all of the previously large left pleural effusion has resolved, and the mediastinum has returned to ___.

At least a small right pleural effusion is present, but there may also be right lower lobe consolidation as well. If so, it has improved since earlier in the day.
