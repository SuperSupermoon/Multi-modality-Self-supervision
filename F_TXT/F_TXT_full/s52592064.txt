Right-sided central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. Lung volumes are low which results in crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacity in the left lung base laterally is increased compared to the previous examination, and a tiny left pleural effusion may be present. There is no large pleural effusion on the right or evidence for focal consolidation. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. No pneumothorax is identified.
