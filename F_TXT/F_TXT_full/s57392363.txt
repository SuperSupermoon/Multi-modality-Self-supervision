Two chest tubes remain in place in the left hemithorax, with a persistent moderate-sized partially loculated left pleural effusion. Focal lucency adjacent to the chest tubes in the region of the left costophrenic sulcus could potentially represent loculated basilar pneumothorax. Adjacent subcutaneous emphysema is present in left chest wall. Persistent left retrocardiac opacity, likely due to atelectasis.
