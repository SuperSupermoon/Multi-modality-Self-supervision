Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. The mediastinal contours are stable, with calcification of the aorta redemonstrated. Right basilar calcified nodules and calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are redemonstrated, compatible with prior granulomatous disease. There is perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness, compatible with mild pulmonary edema, which has worsened in the interval. A small pleural effusion on the right demonstrates a component which is loculated laterally. The size of this effusion is similar compared to the prior study. Patchy opacities at lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
