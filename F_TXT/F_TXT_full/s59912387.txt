Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but stable in size. Widespread airspace opacities in the left lung, particularly in the perihilar and basilar regions have worsened in the interval, whereas opacities in the right lung have improved since the recent radiograph. Findings could potentially represent asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but a superimposed secondary process in the left lung such as aspiration should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Persistent small left pleural effusion is noted.
