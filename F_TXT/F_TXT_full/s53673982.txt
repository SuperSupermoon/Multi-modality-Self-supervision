PA and lateral chest images demonstrate a Dobbhoff tube with the tip apparently in the stomach, although the course of the Dobbhoff tube is not entirely visualized on these images. There are no complications, including no pneumothorax visualized. Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged from the radiograph obtained earlier in the same day. There is some mild improvement in the interstitial markings in the lungs from prior imaging. Otherwise, exam is essentially unchanged from earlier imaging.
