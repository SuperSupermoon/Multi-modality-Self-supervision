Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 2.6 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, with the tip not well visualized. The heart remains severely enlarged. There is mild pulmonary edema which has progressed compared to the previous study with a probable layering left pleural effusion. Persistent bibasilar airspace opacities again may reflect atelectasis, aspiration or infection. There is no large pneumothorax on this supine study.
