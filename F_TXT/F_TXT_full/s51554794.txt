As compared to the previous radiograph, the previously malpositioned Dobbhoff catheter has been re-positioned. The catheter shows a normal course, the tip of the catheter projects over the proximal parts of the stomach. There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.
