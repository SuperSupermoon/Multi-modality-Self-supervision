There are low lung volumes. The heart size is mildly enlarged but unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with no overt pulmonary edema. Linear opacities within the lung bases are progressed from prior and likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
