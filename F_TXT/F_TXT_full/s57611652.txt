The ET tube is unchanged. Single-lead pacer device is visualized with lead projecting over the expected region of the right ventricle. Spinal fixation device is again visualized. Sternal wires are present. NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach. There is volume loss at both bases and small bilateral effusions right greater than left. Given the amount of opacity at the bases, an underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded. There is pulmonary vascular re-distribution. The overlying impression is that of CHF, volume loss and cannot exclude infectious infiltrate.
