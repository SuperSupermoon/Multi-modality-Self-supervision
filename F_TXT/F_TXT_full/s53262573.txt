1. Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. Left subclavian PICC line and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. There are layering bilateral effusions with bibasilar airspace opacities, most likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. The vasculature is cephalized consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension, but no pulmonary edema is evident. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
