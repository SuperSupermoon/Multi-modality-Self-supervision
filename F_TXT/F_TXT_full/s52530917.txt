As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the stomach, and there is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The previously placed left internal jugular vein catheter has been replaced and removed. Unchanged low lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly and signs of moderate pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions.
