Assessment is limited by patient positioning and rotation. Heart size appears mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are grossly unremarkable. There is no overt pulmonary edema, nor is there a pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low. There appear to be patchy opacities in the lung bases which are nonspecific, and may be reflective of infection or aspiration. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
