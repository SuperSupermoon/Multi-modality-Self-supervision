The endotracheal tube is 2.7 cm above the carina. Feeding tube is coiled in the stomach with tip off the film. Right subclavian line tip is in the SVC. There continues to be pulmonary vascular redistribution and perihilar haze and small bilateral effusions compatible with fluid overload. There is dense retrocardiac opacity that could be due to volume loss/effusion/infiltrate.
