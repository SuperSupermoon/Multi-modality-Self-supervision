Support and monitoring devices are in standard position. Previously present homogeneous opacity along the left upper mediastinum has resolved, and likely reflected left upper lobe collapse. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by mild-to-moderate edema as well as bilateral pleural effusions, small on the right and small to moderate on the left. No definite pneumothorax on this supine radiograph.
