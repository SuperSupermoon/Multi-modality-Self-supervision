Right-sided PICC line has been pulled back and now ends in the lower SVC. Mild pulmonary edema has slightly redistributed not changed significantly and severity. Left lung base is now more lucent with an unusual round shape, this could only be spared lungs, however close attention to this area on follow up is suggested. Right basilar opacification has worsened, probably from pleural effusion and atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
