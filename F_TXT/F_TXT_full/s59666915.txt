A frontal view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Blunting at the left costophrenic sulcus is unchanged and may be due to a small effusion or pleural thickening. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinal silhouette with an enlarged aorta is stable. A left humeral head fracture is unchanged.
