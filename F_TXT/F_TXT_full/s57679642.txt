The endotracheal tube terminates 4.5 cm from the carina. Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip in the stomach. However, the side port of nasogastric tube is above the diaphragm. Advancement is recommended. The lungs are clear. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusions. There is apparent mediastinal widening which is more than what would be expected despite the supine portable technique. Findings may reflect underlying adenopathy or mediastinal pathology, recommend dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph for further evaluation when clinically stable. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size.
