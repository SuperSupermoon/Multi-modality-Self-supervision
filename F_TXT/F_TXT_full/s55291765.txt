AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier at 02:45 p.m. The ET tube tip is 6.5 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach and should be further advanced. Widespread parenchymal consolidations are demonstrated, unchanged. No change in cardiomediastinal silhouette or development of pneumothorax is seen.
