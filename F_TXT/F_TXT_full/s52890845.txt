Since chest radiograph 5 hours ago, no relevant change. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. Unchanged moderate pulmonary edema. The difference in appearance of the right hemithorax on previous radiograph is explained by patient's rotation on previous radiograph. Unchanged lower lung volumes. Support devices are unchanged in position from prior study. Small pleural effusions are unchanged in size.
