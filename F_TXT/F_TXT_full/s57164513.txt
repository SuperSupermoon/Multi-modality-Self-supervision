The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 7.2 cm from the carina and can be advanced. The tip of the right internal jugular central venous catheter projects over the upper SVC. The tip of the gastric tube likely extends into the gastric body. There is known elevation of the left hemidiaphragm as compared to the prior CT scan. Increased opacities in the left mid to lower lung zone likely reflect intra-abdominal contents with associated atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
