Severe global pulmonary opacification has improved slightly in the right lung, worsened on the left since most recent study. This may reflect left cubitus positioning. Pleural effusion is presumed but not large. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. ET tube is in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. The prior study showed that more proximally it was looped in the hypopharynx but this region is not included on this study, so malposition is not excluded. Right internal jugular line ends in the upper right atrium.
