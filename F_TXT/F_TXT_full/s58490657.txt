Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta is tortuous but unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Streaky atelectasis is noted in both lung bases. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Known multiple myeloma lesions involving the right-sided ribs and thoracic spine are better assessed on the previous CT.
