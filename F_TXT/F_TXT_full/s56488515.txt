A left-sided PICC line has been removed. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. Aside from streaky left basilar opacity suggesting minor atelectasis, the lungs appear clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No free air is demonstrated. A partly imaged catheter projects over the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, compatible with a gastrostomy tube.
