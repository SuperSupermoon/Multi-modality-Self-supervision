As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. As expected, the lung volumes have decreased. The current image shows mild pulmonary edema and a retrocardiac atelectasis. The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. A pre-existing zone of increased radiodensity at the right lung base is constant in appearance. No newly appeared parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax.
