Single portable view of the chest. No prior. Linear opacities at the lung bases suggestive of atelectasis. Probable left lateral prior rib fractures are identified inferiorly. There is also evidence of biapical scarring. There is no large effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Several densities seen in the left suprahilar region and projecting over the anterior first left rib. These could be costochondral calcifications; however, two-view chest x-ray is suggested to further characterize when patient is amenable.
