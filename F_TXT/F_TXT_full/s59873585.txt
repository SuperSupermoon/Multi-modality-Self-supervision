CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.1 cm above the carina. There is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of left hemidiaphragm. Possible mild vascular plethora. Atelectasis at right base. Small effusions cannot be excluded. Compared with ___ at 4:55 a.m., I doubt significant interval change.
