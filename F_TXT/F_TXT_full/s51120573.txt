In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. There may still be a very tiny right apical pneumothorax, of no clinical significance. Continued enlargement of cardiac silhouette with elevated pulmonary venous pressure and left effusion with volume loss in the lower lobe. The right hemidiaphragm is less well seen, suggesting either some re-accumulation of pleural fluid or a more supine position of the patient.
