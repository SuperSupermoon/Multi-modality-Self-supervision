Stable cardiac enlargement. There has been interval development of mild interstitial edema. Subtle patchy opacities at both bases likely reflect patchy atelectasis rather than aspiration or pneumonia. Clinical correlation is recommended. No pneumothorax. Previously reported 6 mm nodular opacity in the right mid lung is not well appreciated on the current study.
