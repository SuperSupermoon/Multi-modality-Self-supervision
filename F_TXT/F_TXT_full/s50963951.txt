Tip of intra-aortic balloon pump has been advanced, and is now located at the expected level of the superior aspect of the aortic arch, as discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 5:50 p.m. on ___ at time of discovery. Other indwelling devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Marked patient rotation somewhat limits comparison to the prior study, but bilateral mid and lower lung predominant airspace opacities have apparently slightly worsened in the interval, likely due to pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged, and there is no visible pneumothorax.
