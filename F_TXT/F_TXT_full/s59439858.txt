AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. There is no substantial change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The left chest tube has been discontinued. There is no definitive pneumothorax present. Small amount of left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. The right internal jugular line and Port-A-Cath catheter appear to be in expected unchanged locations. The ligation material projecting over the expected location of the left atrial appendage is noted.
