In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to at least to lower body of the stomach. The tip of the PICC line is in the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. Again there is mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure with probable bilateral effusions, more prominent on the left, and mild bibasilar atelectasis. The clavicular and scapular fractures are again seen, as are several fractures of left ribs. No evidence of pneumothorax.
