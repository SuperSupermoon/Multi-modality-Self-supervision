AP chest compared to ___: Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged over the past several days, but pulmonary vascular engorgement has definitely improved. There are no findings to suggest pneumonia. Mild interstitial pulmonary abnormality could be edema alone, but alternatively could be due to mild pulmonary fibrosis or minimal edema in the setting of emphysema. Plate-like atelectasis at the left lung base is new. No lobar collapse. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Vascularity is generally large, tortuous and heavily calcified, but not focally aneurysmal.
