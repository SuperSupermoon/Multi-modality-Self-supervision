As compared to the previous radiograph, there is still no convincing evidence of a left pneumothorax. Two left chest tubes remain in situ, as do the other monitoring and support devices, with the exception of the left subclavian vein catheter that has been removed in the interval. Minimal increase in opacity at the right lung base, likely atelectatic in nature. Unchanged displaced left rib fractures.
