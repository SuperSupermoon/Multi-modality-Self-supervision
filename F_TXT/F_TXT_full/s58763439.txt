There has been interval placement of a endotracheal tube which terminates approximately 7.4 cm above the carina, with distal tip of the tube at the inferior edge of the medial clavicular heads. There has also been interval placement of a nasogastric tube which appears to terminate below the level of the diaphragm and outside the view of this radiograph. Of note, the inferior edge of this film probably lies in the region of the GE junction. Otherwise, no gross interval change is detected compared with the chest radiograph performed 30 minutes earlier. Again seen is cardiomegaly, with pulmonary edema. There has probably been slight improvement in the appearance of the right upper lobe. Possible slight improvement in the degree of interstitial edema in the left upper lobe. Left-sided pacemaker device again noted, with 2 leads in appropriate position.
