Portable chest radiograph evaluation is somewhat limited by rotation. Interval removal of right-sided chest tube with possible interval development of a small right pneumothorax. Increased opacification of right upper lobe may reflect degree of associated collapse. There has been notable interval improvement of aeration of the bilateral lung bases with residual atelectasis in the left lung base and small bilateral pleural effusions. Stable cardiac enlargement with improved but persistent vascular congestion.
