The heart size is normal. The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal. There is a new veil-like density over the bases of both lungs reflecting new small bilateral pleural effusions. An relative increase in opacification at the left base is either atelectasis or pneumonia. The small amount of right subdiaphragmatic free air is presumably post-procedural. There is no pneumothorax. The heart is normal in size. Hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
