AP semi-upright portable chest radiograph obtained. An NG tube is seen with its tip descending below the left hemidiaphragm with its tip not included in the imaged field. The endotracheal tube is also seen with its tip residing just less than a centimeter above the carina. Retraction by at least 1-2 cm is advised for more optimal placement. Bibasilar opacities could represent atelectasis versus pneumonia.
