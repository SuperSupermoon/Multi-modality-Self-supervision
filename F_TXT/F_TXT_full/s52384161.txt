AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Comparison is made to the next preceding similar study obtained five hours earlier during the same day. As before, there is status post mitral and tricuspid annuloplasty noted within the enlarged heart shadow and reconstructive surgery of the thoracic aorta with large sized stent structures within the aortic arch area. In comparison with the next preceding study, the only difference is the removal of a right-sided lower pigtail and drainage tubes apparently located in the posterior sinus of the right pleural space. The pleural changes remain stable and no pneumothorax has developed in the apical area.
