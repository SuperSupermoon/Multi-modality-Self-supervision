An endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube courses through the esophagus, with an abnormal curvature to the left, within a moderate-sized retrocardiac hiatal hernia. The mediastinum and heart are shifted to the left due to volume loss and collapse of the left lower lobe. Left midlung linear atelectasis is noted, along with a layering left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The right lung is grossly clear.
