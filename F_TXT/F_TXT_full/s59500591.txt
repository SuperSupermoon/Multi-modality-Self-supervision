Again seen is an ET tube, tip approximately 4.3 cm above the carina, and an NG tube, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Mild upper zone redistribution is similar to the prior study. Patchy retrocardiac opacity is more pronounced, with new obscuration of the medial left hemidiaphragm. Otherwise, no focal infiltrate. No gross effusion.
