In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued low lung volumes which accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. The pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits. There is now increased opacification at the right base with obscuration of the costophrenic angle, consistent with atelectasis and effusion. Persistent atelectatic changes are seen on the left, though the costophrenic angle is sharply seen.
