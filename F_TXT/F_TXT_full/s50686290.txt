The inspiratory lung volumes remain decreased but improved from the most recent prior study. There is no significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax on this single frontal view. Minimal patchy opacities projecting over the left mid lung field may represent atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. Mild streaky opacification of the bilateral lung bases is most compatible with atelectasis on the left greater than the right. Retrocardiac opacification corresponds to the patient's known large hiatal hernia. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement or edema.
