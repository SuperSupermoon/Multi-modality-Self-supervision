T-shaped tracheostomy tube appears in unchanged position. Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is mild cephalization of pulmonary vascular markings without overt pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Linear opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No acute osseous abnormalities seen. Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the supraclavicular regions is seen bilaterally.
