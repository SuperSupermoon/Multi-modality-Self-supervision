The pericardial drainage is in place although the impression is that there is interval increase in the cardiac silhouette does a concern for reaccumulation of pericardial effusion is still present. Left pleural effusion is noted, difficult to compare with the previous examination, potentially unchanged. No pneumothorax is present. Small amount of right pleural fluid cannot be excluded. Right PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Bibasal left more than right areas of atelectasis in left retrocardiac opacity are unchanged. Assessment of the pericardial effusion demonstrate substantial loculation of the pericardial fluid on the right that potentially might not be draining through the existing drainage.
