AP chest compared to ___, 9:21 a.m.: A mass-like opacity surrounding the right hilus lower pole should be considered pneumonia until proved otherwise. Alternatively, the new small right pleural effusion could have a fissural component and simulates a lung lesion. Conventional upright chest radiograph should be able to clarify that. Pulmonary vasculature is more engorged today than it was yesterday and severe cardiomegaly slightly more pronounced.
