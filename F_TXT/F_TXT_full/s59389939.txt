Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study. Endotracheal tube and right-sided PICC are unchanged in position. There is persistent and slightly increased airspace opacification seen at the right lung base with partial silhouetting of the right hemidiaphragm. While this may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, infection cannot be excluded. No definite pleural effusion seen. No pneumothorax.
