Pulmonary vascular congestion in the left lung has increased since ___, although there is no definite pulmonary edema. Pleural effusion on the left is small if any. The heart is not enlarged. Mediastinal veins are somewhat more distended consistent with volume overload. The appearance of the right lower hemi thorax is abnormal but the explanation is not entirely clear. The right lung base became appreciably more elevated between ___ and ___. Abdomen CT on ___ showed that was due substantially to elevation of the diaphragm, ascites, and right middle lobe collapse. Whether there is new right pleural effusion is radiographically indeterminate, and aeration in the right lung base is also in question. If patient has respiratory insufficiency, CT scanning, with the use of intravenous contrast to highlight atelectasis, would be very useful. There is no pneumothorax. Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC.
