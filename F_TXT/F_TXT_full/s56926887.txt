A single frontal portable radiograph of the chest was acquired. Lung volumes are slightly low. Hazy opacification of both lower lungs is at least partially attributable to overlying soft tissues. There is no focal consolidation. No pleural effusions are seen. There is no pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal.
