There are multiple overlying lines and tubes. The ET tube is 4 cm above the carina. It is difficult to tell precisely were the Swan-Ganz catheter tip is but it is likely in the right pulmonary outflow tract. But 2 right-sided chest tubes are again visualized. The left IJ line tip is in the SVC. There is a small left effusion. There is a tiny right effusion. There is hazy alveolar infiltrate but overall that has improved compared to the film from the prior day.
