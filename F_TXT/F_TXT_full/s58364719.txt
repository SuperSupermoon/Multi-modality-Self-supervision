Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar opacities potentially atelectasis noting that infection or aspiration are possible. Of note there multiple linear lucencies paralleling portions of the mediastinum without subcutaneous gas in the neck. It is uncertain if these are artifactual or due to a pneumomediastinum. Suggest PA and lateral if patient is amenable or simply repeat exam for further evaluation.
