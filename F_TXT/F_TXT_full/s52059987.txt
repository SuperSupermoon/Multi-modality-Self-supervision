As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Extensive bilateral areas of parenchymal opacities with air bronchograms, likely reflecting pulmonary edema. The extent of the known bilateral pleural effusions is constant. Constant appearance of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax. No new parenchymal opacities. The monitoring and support devices are constant.
