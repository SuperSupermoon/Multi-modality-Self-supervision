AP chest compared to ___: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has probably worsened since 3:40 a.m. Apparent decrease in the previously large right pleural effusion may be a function of supine positioning, but given the appropriate history, could be due to interval thoracentesis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Endotracheal tube is in standard placement. Dual-channel dialysis catheter ends in the low SVC and upper right atrium. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
