AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. Left lower lobe consolidation is unchanged, but there is interval slight improvement of the right lower lung opacity that potentially might reflect improvement of atelectasis/infectious process/aspiration. There is no pulmonary edema demonstrated. Note is made that the left costophrenic angle was not included in the field of view.
