Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates marked dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine. The cardiac silhouette may be slightly enlarged. No definite pneumothorax is identified. The tip of the endotracheal tube appears to terminate approximately 5 cm above the carina. There is biapical pleural thickening. Retrocardiac opacities are a combination of small to moderate effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Faint opacity in the right base could also represent small pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Left perihilar opacities are worrisome for aspiration
