Again seen are numerous left-sided rib fractures. The left hemidiaphragm appears mildly elevated. There is a small left pleural effusion. Small left pneumothorax is seen on the preceding CT (___), is better appreciated on that study. No large pneumothorax is seen on the current study. There is increase in opacification of the left lung which may be due to increasing underlying atelectasis/consolidation. There is persistent left lung volume loss. The right lung appears clear. Thoracic spine transverse process fractures are better evaluated on the preceding CT. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
