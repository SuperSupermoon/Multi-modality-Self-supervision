AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 45 minutes earlier. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. No pneumothorax. The previously described left-sided subclavian central venous line in unchanged position terminating in lower third of SVC. The Dobbhoff line apparently has been exchanged. A new line is again well reaching into the stomach. Its final appearance suggests that it is curved in the distal stomach, not reaching the pylorus or duodenum as yet. For followup examination of this line is suggested to perform abdominal films, as the line escapes almost completely from the chest region.
