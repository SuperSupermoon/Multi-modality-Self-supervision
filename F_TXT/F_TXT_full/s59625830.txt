In comparison to ___ radiograph, marked left rib rotation of the patient on the current radiograph limits comparison to this study. 1 of 2 side ports of the left chest tube appears to be external to the pleural cavity. Small left apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Previously reported right basilar pneumothorax is less evident. No other relevant change.
