The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. As compared to outside chest radiograph performed earlier today, there has been interval improvement of linear and hazy opacities involving the right hemi thorax. Given the this rapid interval change, findings could be secondary to improving pulmonary edema. There still remains pulmonary vascular congestion and mild to moderate pulmonary edema, right worse than left, and this can be seen in the setting of asymmetric pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
