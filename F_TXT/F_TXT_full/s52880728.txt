AP chest compared to ___: Initial severe increase in mediastinal widening. PICC in the region of the aorta is unchanged since 3:36 p.m. Accompanying mild rightward tracheal shift raises concern for hematoma or aortic dissection and needs to be evaluated in light of the clinical history, particularly the surgical procedure, not provided to me. I have paged ___ for discussion. Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened. There is no pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion is presumed. ET tube and Swan-Ganz catheter are in standard placements. An upper enteric drainage tube ends above the diaphragm and would need to be advanced at least 15 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach.
