Right chest tube that was fissural in chest CT is in unchanged position. Most of the right lower lung opacities are due to atelectasis and high diaphragm due to the liver process. There was no significant residual or pleural effusion on the chest CT except for a small loculation in the fissure. Left lung is unremarkable. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.
