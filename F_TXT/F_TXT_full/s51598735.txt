Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Lung volumes are low. Patchy opacity in right infrahilar region probably represents a combination of patchy atelectasis and adjacent small pleural effusion. Aspiration or an early focus of pneumonia are additional considerations, and followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard. Within the left hemithorax, a small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
