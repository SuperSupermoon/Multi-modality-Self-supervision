Endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina. Right greater than the left bibasilar opacities likely relate to aspiration as seen on preceding CT, small underlying right pleural effusion not excluded. No large pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Bilateral rib fractures are better assessed on CT. Chronic appearing deformity of the proximal right humerus is seen.
