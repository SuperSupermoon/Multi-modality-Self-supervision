AP chest compared to ___: There is no endotracheal tube or obvious nasogastric tube. Lung volumes remain extraordinarily low, and mild edema has worsened slightly in the left lung, redistributed in the right lung. Bibasilar atelectasis is considerable, probably increased. Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size which is probably top normal. Small right pleural effusion is slightly larger. Small drainage catheter projecting over the right diaphragmatic region cannot be localized on the single frontal view. Right jugular line ends in the right atrium, and would need to be withdrawn 15 mm for positioning in the low SVC.
