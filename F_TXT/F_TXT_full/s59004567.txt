AP chest compared to ___, 12:03 p.m.: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, best appreciated in the left lung, is new. Small residual right pleural effusion or pleural thickening unchanged. No clear pneumothorax, though a small pocket of pleural air could persist at the lateral aspect of the right lung base, there is none superiorly. Cardiac silhouette is still substantially enlarged due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.
