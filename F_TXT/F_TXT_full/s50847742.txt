This is the number 4 portable chest examination of ___. The previous first two examinations express concern that the ETT was terminating unusually high. On this final portable chest film, the ETT kiss into the area of the bifurcation and points towards the right main bronchus. Its position is really too low as it may obstruct the left main bronchus with atelectasis to follow. It may be pointed out that the carina is somewhat difficult to identify because the patient has significant left atrial enlargement elevating the cardiac contours. The degree of pulmonary congestion and amount of pleural effusions has not changed significantly during the last hour. No pneumothorax has developed. An attending physician was reached via telephone, and the concern submitted. The responsible anesthesiologist/pulmonologist would be informed immediately.
