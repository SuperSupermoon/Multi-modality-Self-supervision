AP chest compared to ___: Large mass-like area of consolidation, with small cavitations has not improved appreciably since earliest recent chest radiograph ___. Whether this is pneumonia, lung abscess or mass is radiographically indeterminate. Mild pulmonary edema persists. A region of mild peribronchial opacification in the right lower lobe could represent the result of aspirated purulent material. ET tube is in standard placement, but sharp definition of the cuff suggests pooled secretions above it. Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach but would need to be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Right supraclavicular dual catheter dialysis set ends in the right atrium. Remnants of the left-sided dialysis set are in the SVC and right atrium aside from a fragment which has been embolized to the left lower lobe, unchanged since ___. Heart size normal. Pleural effusions are small, unchanged. No pneumothorax. Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings at the time of this dictation.
