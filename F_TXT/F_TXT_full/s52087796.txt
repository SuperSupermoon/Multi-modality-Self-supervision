Lung volumes remain relatively low. There is increasing perihilar and airspace opacities throughout both lungs with relative sparing of the right upper lung. Given the interval change, this would favor mild to moderate pulmonary edema rather than an acute infectious process. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. No pneumothorax.
