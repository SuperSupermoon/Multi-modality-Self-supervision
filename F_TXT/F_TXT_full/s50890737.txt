There is again seen a large multinodular thyroid goiter which is better assessed on the prior chest CT. This causes prominence of the upper mediastinum. Cardiac border is within normal limits. There is mild hyperinflation. There is likely a small left-sided pleural effusion and there is some atelectasis versus early infiltrate at the left retrocardiac region. There are no pneumothoraces.
