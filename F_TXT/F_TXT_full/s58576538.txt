Lung volumes are low. Focal airspace consolidation in the right mid to lower lung, which when correlated with the CT, likely corresponds to a more confluent opacity within the right middle lobe or represents post bronchoscopy changes. The right paratracheal soft tissue is prominent and likely corresponds to lymphadenopathy as evident on recent CT. The multiple pulmonary nodules seen on the recent CT are less apparent on the plain radiograph. In addition, the CT better demonstrates the extensive hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. No large effusions are seen. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged given lower lung volumes and differences in patient positioning. No large pneumothorax ,although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
