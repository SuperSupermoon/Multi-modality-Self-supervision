A left subclavian central venous catheter projects over the superior SVC. Lung volumes remain low, and lungs remain clear except for persistent right basilar atelectasis adjacent to an elevated hemidiaphragm. The heart and mediastinum are magnified by the projection. Coarse right upper quadrant hepatic calcifications are unchanged. There is also a new trace right pleural effusion.
