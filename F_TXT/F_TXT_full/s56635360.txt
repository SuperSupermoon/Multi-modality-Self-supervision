Large left upper to mid lung consolidation and medial right mid to lower lung consolidation most consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Difficult to exclude trace right pleural effusion. No large left pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Slight prominence at the AP window may be due to underlying mediastinal lymph node. The superior mediastinum is otherwise not widened.
