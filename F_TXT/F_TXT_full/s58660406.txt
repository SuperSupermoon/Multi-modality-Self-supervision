Lung volumes are decreased compared to the prior exam. Diffuse interstitial abnormality with ill-defined small nodules is most pronounced in the lung bases, findings compatible with bronchiectasis with chronic peribronchial inflammation. Worsening bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect superimposed acute infection or exacerbation of underlying airways disease. There is no pneumothorax. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle likely reflects chronic pleural thickening. The cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours remain enlarged, as noted on the prior CT, at which time lymphadenopathy was identified in these regions. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
