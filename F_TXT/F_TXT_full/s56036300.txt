Compared with the prior study and allowing for significant differences in positioning, degree of vascular plethora may be slightly increased. There is also slight blurring due to respiratory motion. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is again seen. The right hemidiaphragm is much less well delineated --___ could be an artifact of positioning, but suggests the presence of collapse and/or consolidation at the right lung base. No gross pleural effusion, though small effusions would be difficult to exclude. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. Clips again noted in the the region of the GE junction. ET tube tip lies 3.8 cm above the carina. Right IJ central line lies near the cavoatrial junction, unchanged. NG type tube extends beneath the diaphragm to overlie the proximal stomach. No pneumothorax is detected.
