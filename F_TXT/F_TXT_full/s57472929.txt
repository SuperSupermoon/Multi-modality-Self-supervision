The endotracheal tube terminates 4.1 cm from the carina. The enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view. Low lung volumes and rightward rotation somewhat limit evaluation. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis related to low lung volumes. There is a mildly displaced fracture of the right anterior sixth rib. Mild contour irregularity of the seventh rib may represent an additional fracture.
