Endotracheal tube is in standard position. Subcutaneous emphysema in the neck is a new finding and is incompletely evaluated on this chest radiograph EXAMINATION. Exam is otherwise similar to the prior study except for resolution of minor right basilar atelectasis, and worsening left retrocardiac opacification which could be due to worsening atelectasis and or infectious pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion is similar to the prior study.
