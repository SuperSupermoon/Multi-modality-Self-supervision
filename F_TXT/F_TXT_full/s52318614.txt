In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, widespread subcutaneous emphysema persists, reducing the sensitivity for detecting pneumothoraces. With this limitation in mind, a small right apical pneumothorax is probably unchanged, and note is made of a questionable small left apical pneumothorax as well. Exam is similar to the recent study except for improving aeration at both lung bases.
