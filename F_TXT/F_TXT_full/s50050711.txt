A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates the endotracheal tube in standard position with the tip 4 cm above the carina, as well as a Swan-Ganz catheter with the tip in the right pulmonary artery and a nasogastric tube which extends at least into the stomach. Lung volumes are extremely low, resulting in vascular crowding. There has been interval development of mild pulmonary edema and engorgement of pulmonary vessels, including the pulmonary arteries. The cardiomediastinum otherwise has the expected postoperative appearance. There is no focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
