As compared to the previous examination, the endotracheal tube has been slightly advanced. The tip of the tube now projects 3.7 cm above the carina. The course of the newly positioned nasogastric tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not included on the image. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The bilateral, predominantly peripheral and apical parenchymal opacities with multiple air bronchograms as well as general increase of radiodensity of the lung parenchyma are constant and would be consistent with clinical ARDS. A small retrocardiac atelectasis has newly appeared. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
