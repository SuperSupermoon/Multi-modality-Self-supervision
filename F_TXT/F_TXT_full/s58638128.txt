Single frontal view of the chest. Pneumomediastinum remains evident, though slightly smaller than on the prior exam. Heart size and mediastinal contours are otherwise stable. Small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent bibasilar opacities have both slightly improved since the prior exam, though with persistent left lower lobe collapse. No pneumothorax. Tracheostomy and PEG tube are stable.
