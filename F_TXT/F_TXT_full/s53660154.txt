Compared with the previous radiograph, the right chest tube has evacuated the majority of the right pleural effusion seen on ___. There may be residual subpulmonic effusion, suggested by lateral elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, and if clinically warranted, right decubitus views could be obtained. However, the patient is rotated on the current study. Right IJ line terminates in the mid SVC, unchanged. No pneumothorax.
