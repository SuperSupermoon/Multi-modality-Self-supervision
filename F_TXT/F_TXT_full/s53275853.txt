ET tube ends 4.5 cm above the carina. An OG tube has tip within the stomach but sidehole above the GE junction. It would need to be advanced by approximately 6 cm to have the last sidehole in the stomach. Compared with two hours prior, pulmonary vascular congestion persists with worsening of the large right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. No pneumothorax.
