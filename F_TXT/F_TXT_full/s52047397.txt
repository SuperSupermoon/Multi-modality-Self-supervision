A tracheostomy tube is appropriately positioned. A left PICC ends in the upper SVC. A surgical clip is seen in the right upper abdominal quadrant. There is a moderate left pleural effusion with marked volume loss of the left lower lobe, not significantly changed. There is minimal right lower lung atelectasis. The heart size is difficult to assess given the marked volume loss at the left lung base, but it is likely mildly enlarged, not significantly changed. There is no pneumothorax.
