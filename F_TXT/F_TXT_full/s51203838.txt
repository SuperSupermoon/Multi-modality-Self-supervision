Heart size is normal. The aorta demonstrates calcifications predominantly at the aortic knob. Hilar contours are normal. Slight widening of the superior mediastinum may be due to supine positioning and AP technique. There is a focal calcification in the right lung base, likely reflecting a granuloma. Minimal atelectasis is noted in the left lung base. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. No displaced rib fractures are noted. Widening of the right acromioclavicular joint likely reflects prior trauma.
