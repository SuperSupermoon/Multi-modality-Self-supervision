Comparison is made with prior study performed 40 minutes earlier. There has been reposition of right chest tube, now is less kinked. Left chest tube is also less kinked. The side port is just at the entrance of the pleural cavity. There is extensive bilateral subcutaneous emphysema. Cardiac size is normal. Patient has severe emphysema. Multifocal lung opacities in the left upper lobe, right upper lobe and in the right lower lobe have increased in the right lower lobe, consistent with multifocal pneumonia and/or hemorrage as seen in CT performed two hours after this study. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. ET tube is in standard position. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Cardiomediastinum is midline.
