AP chest compared to ___: Location of catheter fragment coiled over the right lower chest is unclear to me. Clinical correlation advised. Dr. ___ was paged at 10:15 a.m. when the finding was recognized and discussed by telephone at 10:30am with the resident who responded. Heart is severely enlarged, particularly left atrium, but there is no longer pulmonary edema or even vascular congestion. Substantial hiatus hernia may have increased in size since ___, the earliest chest radiograph on this admission. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion is small on the right if any. Could be a tiny right pneumothorax. If this is necessary to document, then repeat radiograph should be obtained with the patient fully upright.
