Right trans jugular temporary pacemaker lead projects over the floor of the right ventricle. No pneumothorax, pleural effusion or mediastinal widening. Lungs clear. Heart size normal. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of such abnormalities. If the demonstration of a fracture or other trauma is clinically warranted, the location of any focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail views or CT scanning.
