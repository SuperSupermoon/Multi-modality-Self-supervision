1. Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet. Right internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. There are stable small bilateral effusions, left greater than right, with some associated patchy airspace process, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No large pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given semi-supine technique. When compared to the prior study, there has been slight interval improvement in aeration in both lungs.
