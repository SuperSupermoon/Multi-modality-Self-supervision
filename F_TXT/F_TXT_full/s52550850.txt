Left chest tube has been removed, and a pigtail pleural catheter has either been replaced or repositioned in the left hemithorax. Interval development of a small lateral left pneumothorax, but apparent decrease in extent of loculated left pleural fluid in the left hemithorax. Multiple small loculated hydropneumothoraces are again demonstrated, with interval worsening of loculated hydropneumothoraces at the left base. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy are again demonstrated as well as extensive bronchovascular thickening and peripheral interstitial thickening in the right hemithorax, previously attributed to Kaposi sarcoma. Dense left retrocardiac opacity appears unchanged as well as a small right pleural effusion.
