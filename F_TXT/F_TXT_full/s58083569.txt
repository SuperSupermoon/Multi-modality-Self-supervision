There has been no significant change in the loculated moderate right pleural effusion after thoracentesis. Persistent pleural thickening with extension into the mediastinum is similar to the prior CT and are ascribed to changes of pleurodesis and/or tumor. A more focal opacity in the right lower lobe is unchanged and consistent with loculated pleural effusion. There is no left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. A right MediPort terminates in the low superior vena cava.
