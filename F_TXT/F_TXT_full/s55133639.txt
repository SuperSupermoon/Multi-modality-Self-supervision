1. There has been interval appearance of a moderate-sized left pneumothorax. There is some shift of the mediastinum and flattening of the diaphragm to suggest a component of tension. Results were discussed at 2:03pm, 2 minutes after the time of discovery by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___. The right lung continues to be diffusely abnormal with parenchymal opacities and distortion as well as some associated pleural thickening. The left apex also demonstrates some post-inflammatory changes with associated distortion but this is also stable. Lungs are overall hyperinflated consistent with underlying emphysema. Overall cardiac contour cannot be assessed given the mediastinal shift and diffuse abnormality in the right lung. There continues to be some subcutaneous air within the lateral chest wall tissues on the left.
