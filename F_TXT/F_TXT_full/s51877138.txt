The patient is status post mitral valve replacement and probably coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The heart is mildly enlarged. There is patchy basilar opacification suggesting a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion. Streaky left upper lobe opacity suggests minor atelectasis or scarring which is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. No free air is demonstrated.
