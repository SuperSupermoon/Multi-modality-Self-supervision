Severe cardiomegaly has increased, mild pulmonary edema not appreciably changed. Left trans subclavian right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead unchanged in position. Swan-Ganz catheter ending in the descending right pulmonary artery should be withdrawn 4 cm to standard position. Previous attempt at withdrawal failed to move the catheter tip, instead it reduced the intracardiac loop. Pleural effusion small if any. No pneumothorax.
