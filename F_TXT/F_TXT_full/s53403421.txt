Left-sided dual lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the low SVC in courses through a stent within the left brachiocephalic and superior vena cava. A vascular stent is also noted within the left upper extremity. Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged unchanged with similar rightward deviation of the trachea due to a known left thyroid goiter again noted. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Minimal patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. There may be trace bilateral pleural effusions, but no focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. Clips are noted about the neck. Remote fractures of the right posterior ribs are again seen.
