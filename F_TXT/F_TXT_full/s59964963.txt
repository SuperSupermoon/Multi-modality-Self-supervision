Heart size remains mild to moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob again demonstrated. Mild upper zone vascular re-distribution is presumably due to supine positioning. The opacification over the left mid and lower lung fields appear well marginated, and could be due to overlying soft tissue structures. No other focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the imaged thoracolumbar spine. Degenerative changes are also noted within both shoulders.
