As compared to the previous radiograph, lung volumes have increased, potentially reflecting increased ventilatory pressure or improved ventilation. However, relatively extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities, reflecting bleeding, and right more severe than left, are still clearly visible. The pre-existing pleural effusion on the right appears to have improved, whereas the pre-existing left pleural effusion is constant. Constant normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
