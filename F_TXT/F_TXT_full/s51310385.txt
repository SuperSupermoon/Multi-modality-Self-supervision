Low lung volumes account for some degree of bronchovascular crowding. Vague opacities in both lung bases may be due to underinflation and summation of structures given superimposition of multiple ribs, although pneumonia cannot be completely excluded. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. Spinal hardware is also stable without evidence of hardware-related complications.
