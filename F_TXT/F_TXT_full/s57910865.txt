A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a left chest wall pacer with leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle. Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is resolved. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Right base opacity is consistent with a small pleural effusion. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
