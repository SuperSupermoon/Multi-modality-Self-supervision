AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Moderate pulmonary edema, probably most pronounced posteriorly, has worsened in the right lung, at least since ___. Left lower lobe remains densely consolidated, most commonly due to atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions, presumed. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly stable. ET tube, right internal jugular line, and upper enteric drainage tube are in standard positions. A right PICC line can barely be traced to the upper right atrium, but before repositioning, if that is desired, conventional radiographs should be obtained, for more secure localization.
