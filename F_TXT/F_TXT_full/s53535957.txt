AP chest compared to ___: Large area of new heterogeneous opacification in the left mid and lower lung zone is most likely pneumonia. Lung volumes are lower in general today than previously, accounting for greater opacification at the right lung base, though I cannot exclude pneumonia in that location as well. A very small right pleural effusion may be present. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding.
