All worsened since ___ are: Severe cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular engorgement, and mediastinal widening due to venous distention. Although there is no pulmonary edema as yet, these findings all reflect cardiac decompensation, particularly right heart failure, and perhaps volume overload. Left lower lobe atelectasis is severe, small bilateral pleural effusions are stable. ET Tube is in standard placement. Esophageal drainage tube would need to be advanced 10 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. There is no longer a right jugular central venous catheter in place. No pneumothorax is present.
