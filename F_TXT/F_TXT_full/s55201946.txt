No definite pneumothorax is seen on these films, suggesting that the pneumothorax previously seen is small and has not increased from previous examination. A suggestion of a pleural line in the right apex would reflect at most a small apical pneumothorax. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen with low lung volumes. No pleural effusion is identified. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Please see the CT for better assessment of the fractures.
