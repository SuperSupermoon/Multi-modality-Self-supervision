Linear opacities in the lung bases correspond with areas of subsegmental atelectasis seen on concurrent CT. No confluent opacity is identified to suggest pneumonia. A subcentimeter pulmonary nodule seen on concurrent CT is not well visualized on this radiographic examination. There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is evident. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
