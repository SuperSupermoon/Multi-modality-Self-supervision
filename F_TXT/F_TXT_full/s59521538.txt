Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for positional differences of the patient. Lungs are grossly clear, except for a vertically oriented opacity in the left mid lung region, which may reflect pleural fluid within the left major fissure or an area of band-like atelectasis. Small right apical pneumothorax has decreased in size with apical visceral pleural line now located just above the fourth right posterior rib level.
