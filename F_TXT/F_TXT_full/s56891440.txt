AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC. The left internal jugular line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unremarkable. Widespread perihilar opacities are noted, consistent with pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacity is slightly more asymmetric and attention to this area to exclude underlying process such as aspiration or pneumonia should be paid.
