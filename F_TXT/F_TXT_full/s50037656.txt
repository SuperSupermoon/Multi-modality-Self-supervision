Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There are slightly low lung volumes. Bibasilar atelectasis is seen. Relative opacity projecting over the costophrenic angles most likely relates to overlying soft tissue. No radiopaque foreign body is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
