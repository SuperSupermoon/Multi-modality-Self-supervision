Interval removal of the right internal jugular central line. The left internal jugular central line and feeding tube are unchanged in position, although the tip of the feeding tube is not entirely visualized. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is improving aeration at the left base and a persistent stable patchy opacity at the right base. A peripheral opacity in the left upper lung is now barely visible. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
