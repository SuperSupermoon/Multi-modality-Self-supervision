Semi-upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of a left chest tube. There is no definite pneumothorax. There is bibasilar opacity, likely reflecting a combination of atelectasis, and/or effusion. A Swan-Ganz catheter remains inserted through right IJ access sheath. The tip is in the main pulmonary outflow tract. An endotracheal tube is unchanged in position. An NG tube is not well seen, or as it was previously seen passing into the stomach. Median sternotomy wires are unchanged.
