Compared with the prior film, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is cardiomegaly with a calcified, unfolded aorta ; small left effusion with increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation; patchy opacity at the right base with a small right effusio; and upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF. There is background hyperinflation suggestive of COPD. There is deformity of some of the right upper ribs consistent with old rib fractures. As before, the there is anterior dislocation of the right humeral head with respect to the glenoid .
