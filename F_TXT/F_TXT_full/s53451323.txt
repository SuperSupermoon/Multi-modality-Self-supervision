AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Severe chronic cardiomegaly is slightly larger today than previously and pulmonary vasculature is more engorged, but I do not see pulmonary edema. There is greater opacity at the left lung base which is most likely due to atelectasis, though I cannot exclude recent aspiration. Pleural effusions are presumed, but not appreciable in size and there is no pneumothorax. Healed left posterior rib fracture noted. Stomach is moderately to severely distended with air.
