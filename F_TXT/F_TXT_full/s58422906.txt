Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. Mild interstitial edema persists. Hyperinflation is due to emphysema or severe but item a airway obstruction. Consolidation at the right lung base, either pneumonia or atelectasis worsened between ___ and ___, subsequently unchanged. There is a new uniform sharply marginated radial opacity at the base of the left lung which does not obscure either left heart border or left diaphragmatic interface. I think it is a new component of fissural pleural fluid. Left pigtail drainage catheter still in place. Tiny left apical pneumothorax unchanged. Heart size normal. Tracheostomy tube slightly rotated. Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC. Skin fold in the right upper lateral chest should not be mistaken for a pleural edge of the pneumothorax.
