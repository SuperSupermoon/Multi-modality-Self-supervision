The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic valve replacement. A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the low SVC. A small caliber left IJ line is also noted. The lung volumes are slightly decreased. There is slight elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compared to the right. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged but stable. The mediastinal contours are prominent postoperatively. There is mild calcification of the aortic knob. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is increased from the most recent prior study. There is increased streaky opacification at the right lung base compared to the most recent prior study. In the absence of aspiration, this most likely reflects atelectasis. Mild opacification of the left lung base is unchanged and compatible with mild atelectasis. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
