A left pleural basilar pigtail catheter remains in place. There is persistent retrocardiac consolidation likely reflecting atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. More patchy opacity at the right base is also unchanged. Lung volumes are slightly lower with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
