The patient is status post prior median sternotomy. A feeding tube extends below the level the diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph. A left internal jugular central venous line is unchanged in positioning. There is no significant change in the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion and perihilar fullness. Persisting retrocardiac opacity, likely reflective of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
