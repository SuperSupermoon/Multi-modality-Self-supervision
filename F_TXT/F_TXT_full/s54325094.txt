AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison can be made with the next preceding chest examination of ___. The heart size now fulfills criteria for normality considering bedside examination. Again remarkable is a relative prominence of the left ventricle. Thoracic aorta appears unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and there are no signs of acute or chronic parenchymal infiltrates. Lateral pleural sinuses are free, and no pneumothorax is present in the apical area. When comparison is made with the next preceding examination ___, the at that time existing right-sided PICC line has been removed. The at that time existing more marked cardiac enlargement was probably the result of patient's more recumbent position resulting in geometric distortion.
