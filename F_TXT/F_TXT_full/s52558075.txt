There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with rightward shift of mediastinal structures compatible with a large layering pleural effusion. There are also reticulonodular opacities at the right lung base, likely reflects edema. There is also a small to moderate right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate in the setting of the large pleural effusion. Osseous structures are grossly intact. A right chest Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
