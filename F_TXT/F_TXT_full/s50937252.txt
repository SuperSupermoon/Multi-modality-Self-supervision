In comparison to the prior radiograph, the patient is positioned differently. The patient is upright as opposed to semi-upright previously and more rotated to the right. There is increased atelectasis at the left base. Increased diffuse opacification of the right lung may represent a layering effusion or increased edema within that lung. A moderate right pleural effusion has redistributed but probably stable in size. Tracheostomy tube and right PICC are unchanged in position. Heart size is difficult to evaluate
