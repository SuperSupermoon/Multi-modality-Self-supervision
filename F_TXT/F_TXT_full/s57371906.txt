There is a small residual pneumomediastinum, decreased compared to the prior study. Widening of the mediastinum is similar in degree. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement persists with linear atelectasis in the right lung base, at the site of the prior chest drain. The chest tubes have been removed. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, a large poor right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. There is a focal airspace opacity adjacent to the left heart border which likely reflects atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.
