In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. Pericardial drain is in place. Metallic opacification overlying the right main stem bronchus most likely is external to the patient. The PICC line has been removed. The long intestinal tube coils within the stomach with the tip below the level of the film. Residual opacification at the left base is essentially unchanged.
