A right Port-A-Cath terminates in the right atrium, unchanged from prior. Lung volumes are extremely low, limiting evaluation of the lung bases. Increased opacity within the medial right lung is likely due to atelectasis. No confluent consolidation is identified. There is no pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema is identified. There is no large pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
