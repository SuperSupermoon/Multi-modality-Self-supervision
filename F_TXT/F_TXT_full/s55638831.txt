Right chest tube remains in place. A loculated hyperlucency is seen in the right lateral lower thorax which could reflect a loculated pneumothorax. There is improving aeration at the right base with residual patchy opacity which likely reflects resolving atelectasis or edema related to re-expansion. There is a residual small right effusion. Left lung is grossly clear. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient positioning.
