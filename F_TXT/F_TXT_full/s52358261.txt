The lung volumes are low. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No evidence of pneumonia. However, in the right upper lobe, a 1 cm rounded soft tissue structure, not present on the previous radiograph, is seen. To exclude that this structure is resulting from a projection artifact, an upright and lateral radiograph should be performed. If positive, the lesion must be worked up with CT to exclude the presence of a neoplasm. The finding was entered to the radiology dashboard. No pleural effusions. Normal appearance of the hilar structures.
