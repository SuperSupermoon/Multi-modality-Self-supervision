Dense left retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis, slightly increased from the earlier study. No other consolidation. There is a layering small pleural effusion on the left. No pleural effusion on the right. A portion of the left lung apex is not captured on the current study. Accounting for this, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Stable cardiomegaly.
