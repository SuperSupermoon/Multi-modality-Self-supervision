Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates a right pectoral Port-A-Catheter with tip terminating in the lower SVC or upper atrium. Multiple pulmonary nodules are better appreciated on prior cross-sectional studies. A dominant left hilar mass has begun to grow after earlier remission. Worse left hemidiaphragm elevation is explained by phrenic nerve impingement. There is no confluent consolidation, pneumothorax, or large pleural effusion. Prominent epicardial fat pad likely contributes to slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
