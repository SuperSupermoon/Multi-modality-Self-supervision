There are bilateral chest tubes in-situ. The left-sided chest tube has withdrawn slightly and unfolded but still appears to be within the pleural space. Bilateral pleural effusions are similar in appearance when compared to the prior study. No pneumothorax seen. The pleural effusions limit assessment of the cardiomediastinal contour. A right-sided PICC terminates in the distal SVC or right atrium.
