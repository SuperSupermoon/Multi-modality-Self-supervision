There is no pneumothorax. A new nasogastric tube passes inferiorly out of view with the side port over the expected location of the stomach. The cardiac pacemaker and its two leads are in appropriate and unchanged position. The lung volumes are markedly low. There are bilateral pleural effusions. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours cannot be fully evaluated due to the low lung volumes. The pulmonary vessels are crowded, but there is no evidence of edema.
