Lung volumes are lower than on the previous study. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain stable accounting for this fact. Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle is indicative of a small pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral parenchymal opacities have substantially worsened since the prior study. Note is made of a stent in the left axilla, likely in the left subclavian vein.
