There is increased density in the right hilar region and streaky opacification at the right lung base. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a small pleural effusion. Eventration of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. No pneumothorax is detected. The left lung is relatively clear with minimal atelectasis. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and left hilar contours are within normal limits.
