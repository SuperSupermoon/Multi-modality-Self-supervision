Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided. Midline sternotomy wires and multiple mediastinal clips are noted as well as clips in the upper mid abdomen. A dual-lead pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the right atrium and right ventricle. Compared with prior exam, there is persistent bilateral lung base opacity which likely corresponds with pleural thickening and small pleural effusion as seen on prior. However, there is subtle increased hazy opacity in the left lung base which could represent an early pneumonia. The upper lungs remain well aerated. Old right rib deformities are re-demonstrated involving right ribs 6 and 7. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable.
