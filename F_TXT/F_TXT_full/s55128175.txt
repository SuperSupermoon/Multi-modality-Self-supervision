Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There are persistent low lung volumes. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity is unchanged, is a combination of pleural effusion and consolidation. This consolidation could be atelectasis, but superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. Lingular opacities are stable. Small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is unchanged. There are no new lung abnormalities. Right IJ catheter tip is at the lower SVC.
