A right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place. There is a slightly smaller layering right pleural effusion with adjacent airspace opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis of the right lower lobe. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is appreciated. No pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
