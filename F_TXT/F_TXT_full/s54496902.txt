Pulmonary vascular congestion progressed to mild edema on ___ which has subsequently worsened, accompanied by increasing moderate cardiomegaly and increasing small pleural effusion, at least on the left. However there is substantially more severe consolidation at the lower lobes, particular the right, suggesting concurrent pneumonia. Lines and tubes have been removed. No pneumothorax.
