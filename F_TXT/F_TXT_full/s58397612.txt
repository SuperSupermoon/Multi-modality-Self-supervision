The ET tube has been advanced and now terminates 5.6 cm above the carina. Small left pleural effusion persists with left basilar atelectasis. The right heart border is also partially obscured, likely reflecting component of atelectasis, but infection is not excluded. New right IJ catheter tip terminates in the low SVC. There is no pneumothorax. The NG tube has been withdrawn somewhat but the sidehole still appears below the diaphragm. Dr. ___ was paged at the time of the dictation, but subsequent radiograph after repositioning was obtained before any reply.
