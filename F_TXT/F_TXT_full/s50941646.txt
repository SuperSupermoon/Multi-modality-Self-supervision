There is dense retrocardiac opacity on the left, and the band of opacity at the right lung base as well. Dense vascular calcifications of the aortic arch are also notable. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouette do not appear overtly enlarged, although somewhat limited by the technique. It is notable also that the lung apex is somewhat obscured by patient's head positioning. There is no definite pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.
