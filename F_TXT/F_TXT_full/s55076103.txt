The lungs are normally expanded. Irregular opacity at the right base most likely reflects atelectasis although superimposed pneumonia cannot be completely excluded. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is likely normal allowing for AP technique. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema.
