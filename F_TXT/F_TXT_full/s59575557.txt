In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly lower lung volumes. Retrocardiac opacification is again seen, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural fluid. Hazy opacification in the right hemithorax could reflect some layering effusion. There is evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion as well as a continued streak of atelectasis in the left mid-zone. There may be a small left apical pneumothorax which, in retrospect, may have been also present on the previous study.
