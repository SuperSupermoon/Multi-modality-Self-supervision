The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged. There are low lung volumes. Linear opacities in bilateral lung bases once again likely represent atelectases. No pneumothoraces are seen. Small pleural effusion may be seen on the left side or this maybe related to pericardial fat. Bones appear intact.
