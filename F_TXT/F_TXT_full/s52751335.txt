Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. An enteric tube is noted coursing below the left hemidiaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film. The heart size is normal. The aorta is slightly unfolded. There are low lung volumes with crowding of the bronchovascular structures and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. More focal opacity within the retrocardiac region could reflect an area of atelectasis, but infection or aspiration are also possible. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
