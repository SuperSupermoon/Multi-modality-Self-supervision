Semi-erect portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable mild cardiomegaly and bilateral hilar prominence. New significantly increased bibasilar consolidations are evident, left greater than right, which may represent bilateral pleural effusions with an element of lobar collapse on the left, although there is not the expected secondary findings of signficant volume loss. No pneumothorax evident. Sternotomy sutures are midline and intact. Stable splenic artery calcifications identified.
