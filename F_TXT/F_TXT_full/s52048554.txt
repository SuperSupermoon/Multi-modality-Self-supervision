AP chest compared to ___: Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung at the apex, and increasing at the right base could be due to pneumonia. There is a new triangular opacity filling the left lateral pleural sulcus, with a shape suggesting pulmonary infarction. Dr. ___ was paged at 9:35, one minute after recognition, to discuss this new finding, and he directed me to page the Acute Care Service who did not respond to the initial page at 9:40. I discussed the findings by telephone with Dr ___ at 12:20pm. Heart size is normal. Left internal jugular line ends at the junction of brachiocephalic veins. Nasogastric tube loops in the stomach and passes out of view. Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes. No pneumothorax.
