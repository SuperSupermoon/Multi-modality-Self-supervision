The endotracheal tube terminating 5.6 cm above the carina and right IJ central venous catheter terminating at the mid SVC are unchanged. An orogastric tube appears to be retracted to the mid to lower esophagus. A right PICC terminates at the caval atrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. A moderate left pleural effusion appears stable. A small right pleural effusion appears slightly enlarged.
