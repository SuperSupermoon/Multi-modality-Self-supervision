In comparison to the most recent prior study, there is a new left basilar opacity obscuring the left heart border and left hemidiaphragm. Lucency in the bilateral lung apices is consistent with emphysematous change. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size but unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
