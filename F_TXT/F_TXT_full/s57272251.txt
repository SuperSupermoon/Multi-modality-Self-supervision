The ET tube terminates approximately 2.9 cm from the carina. There is an OG tube which traverses below the diaphragm with the tip out of view from this radiograph. The Swan-Ganz catheter appears to be in appropriate position. Again seen is moderate enlargement of the heart, overall stable compared to the prior exam. There appears to be slight interval increase in focal consolidation at the left lung base compared to the prior exam. The left upper and mid lung zones appear to be overall well aerated, unchanged compared to the prior exam. There has been slight interval improvement in the right lung field which is obscured by a moderate-to-large right pleural effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax.
