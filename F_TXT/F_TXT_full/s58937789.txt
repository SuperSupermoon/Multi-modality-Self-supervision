As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the bilateral pleural effusions is unchanged. The effusions are still more extensive on the right than on the left and create relatively substantial areas of atelectasis. A pre-existing miniscule pneumothorax on the left is no longer visible. Mild fluid overload. No evidence of interval appearance of new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
