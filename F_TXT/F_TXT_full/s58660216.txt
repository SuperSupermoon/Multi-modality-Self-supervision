Lung volumes are low which accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which appears mildly enlarged. Aorta is unfolded. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unremarkable. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices suggests underlying emphysema. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Degenerative changes are present within both glenohumeral joints with marked narrowing of the right acromiohumeral interval suggestive of rotator cuff disease.
