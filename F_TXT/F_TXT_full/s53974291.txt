The apparent decrease in size of the right hilar mass is probably due to partial re-expansion of the previously collapsed right upper lobe following endobronchial therapy. It is conceivable that the mass itself may have decreased if the patient has been treated with chemotherapy or radiation. New small linear opacities in the left mid lung could be due to transient edema or atelectasis. Disseminated tumor is less likely given the absence of such finding on the chest CT ___. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart size top-normal.
