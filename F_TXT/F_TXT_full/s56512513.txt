There is an orogastric tube. The radiopaque tip extends beneath the diaphragm and partially off the film. It overlies expected site of the gastric fundus, similar to ___. It has not passed beyond the pylorus. Right sided catheter overlies the right atrium. Left-sided catheter overlies did distal SVC near the SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen is the right-sided pigtail catheter at the right lung base medially. There is probable atelectasis and mild vascular plethora in the right lung, similar to the prior study. No obvious pneumothorax is identified. No gross effusion. Radiopaque structure again seen overlying the lower right chest wall. Again seen is cardiomegaly with dense increased retrocardiac opacity and obscuration left hemidiaphragm, similar to the prior film. Mild vascular plethora seen in the left upper lung. Possibility of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
