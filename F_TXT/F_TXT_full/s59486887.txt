Redemonstrated is extensive subcutaneous emphysema. This reduces the sensitivity for detecting pneumothorax ease. The right-sided chest tube appears to be in slightly changed position, as it may have been pulled back. It may still remain in the chest posteriorly, though definite location is difficult to determinate. Right pneumothorax is likely unchanged. Possible left, small apical pneumothorax may be present. Again seen are bibasilar opacities, not significantly changed since the prior.
