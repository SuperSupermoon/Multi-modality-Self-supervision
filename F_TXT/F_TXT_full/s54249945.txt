There is been interval placement of a dual-lumen central venous catheter with tip in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax. Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged as are moderate size left and small right pleural effusions. Bilateral lower lobe opacities likely reflect atelectasis, unchanged.
