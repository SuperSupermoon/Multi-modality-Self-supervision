A single AP chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs are well expanded and clear. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Well circumscribed nodular opacities projecting over both lung bases are compatible with nipple shadows. Cardiomegally is mild. Mild aortic arch calcifications are unchanged.
