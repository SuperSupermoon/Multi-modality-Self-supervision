Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increased opacification at the bilateral lower lobes, right greater than left, consistent with aspiration pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The endotracheal tube ends 2.8 cm from the carina. The right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends in the mid SVC.
