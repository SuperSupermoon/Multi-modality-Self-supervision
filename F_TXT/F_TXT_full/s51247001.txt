There is a large hiatal hernia with an air-fluid level. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable within the limitations of technique. Streaky medial basilar opacities suggest minor atelectasis or scarring, but there are no findings suggestive of pneumonia of congestive heart failure. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
