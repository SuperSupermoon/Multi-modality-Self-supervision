Again seen is marked cardiomegaly, probably not significantly changed. Also again seen is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, which may be slightly worse. There has been interval improvement in the degree of opacification at the left lung base. There is residual left base atelectasis and a residual small left effusion. Hazy opacity at the right base, slightly increased, may reflect CHF and increased atelectasis. No frank consolidation or gross effusion seen at the right lung base.
