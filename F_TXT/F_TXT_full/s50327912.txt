Dual lead left-sided pacer is unchanged. Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are stable. Bilateral pleural catheters remain in place. No large pleural effusions are appreciated, although more focal opacity at the left base could reflect either lobar atelectasis or a loculated collection. There are stable patchy opacities at both bases suggestive of atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
