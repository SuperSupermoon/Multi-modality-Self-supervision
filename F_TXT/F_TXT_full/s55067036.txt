No previous dimension. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and there is a triple-channel pacer in place with leads in appropriate position. No definite vascular congestion. There is opacification in the retrocardiac region and most likely represents volume loss in the left lower lobe. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, a superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. If the condition of the patient permits, a lateral view would be helpful.
