Mild interstitial abnormality persists, greater on the left lung. There is also the suggestion of new peribronchial opacification in the left lung, partially obscuring cardiac silhouette that could be an early pneumonia. Heart size is normal. There is no pleural effusion. Left central venous infusion pump catheter ends in the right atrium as before.
