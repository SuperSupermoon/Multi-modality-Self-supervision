Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resulting bronchovascular crowding. There is bibasilar atelectasis, which is not significantly changed from the prior study. The heart is not enlarged. The mediastinum remains stably widened. A nasogastric tube is seen with the tip ending in the stomach and the last side port above the GE junction. There is no pneumothorax.
