Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 7 cm above the carina. There is a feeding tube whose side port is at the GE junction. This could be advanced several centimeters for more optimal placement. The intra-aortic balloon pump has been removed since the previous study. There is normal heart size. There are bilateral pleural effusions and left retrocardiac opacity which are stable. No pneumothoraces are identified.
