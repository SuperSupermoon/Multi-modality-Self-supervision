Two right-sided chest tubes enter the thoracic cage laterally and adjacent towards the head of the clavicle, terminating at the level of the aortic arch. Anterior-posterior location cannot be assessed by frontal radiography. Left-sided PICC terminates near the mid SVC. Notable improvement in opacification of the right hemithorax in the short interval since the prior radiograph, most consistent with resolving pulmonary edema. Mild background pulmonary edema on the left is stable. Other than minimal atelectasis at the right lung base, there is no focal consolidation. Small amount of fluid in the right minor fissure has increased. Stable mild cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax.
