Lungs are low in volume but clear. Heart is mildly enlarged. Mediastinum at the level of the aortic arch is wide. This could be due to a tortuous or dilated aorta, and there may be some contribution of vascular engorgement and mediastinal fat but on conventional radiographs, I cannot exclude adenopathy. Followup advised, with chest radiographs performed with the patient sitting as erect as possible.
