Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the patient in semi-upright position. A left subclavian line terminates in the mid SVC. There are new increased opacities in the left retrocardiac region. Again seen are unchanged bilateral upper lung peripheral opacities, consistent with prior sarcoidosis. There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged. A known comminuted fracture of the right humerus is noted.
