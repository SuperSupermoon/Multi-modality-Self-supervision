AP chest compared to ___: Moderate right and large left pleural effusion has increased, worsening bibasilar atelectasis to the point of collapse on the left and making it difficult to determine whether mild pulmonary edema has developed in the setting of severe vascular crowding. Right internal jugular sheath ends in the right atrium, and a feeding tube passes into the duodenum and out of view. No pneumothorax. Heart size is indeterminate because of adjacent pleural and parenchymal opacification, but probably not substantially enlarged.
