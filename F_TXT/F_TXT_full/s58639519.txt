AP view of the chest. Left central venous Port-A-Cath courses into the SVC and loops back on itself with its tip in the upper SVC. The enteric tube ends below the diaphragm; however, the last sidehole is at the GE junction. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Right upper quadrant clips are seen.
