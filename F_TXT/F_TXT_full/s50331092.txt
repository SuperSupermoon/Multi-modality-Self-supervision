The tracheostomy tube is been advanced compared with the prior study, now terminating 5.1 cm from the carina. Moderate pulmonary vascular congestion with mild associated interstitial pulmonary edema is similar to the prior study. Right lower lung airspace opacities may represent asymmetric edema, atelectasis, or consolidation, depending upon the clinical setting. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Calcification of the aortic arch is noted. Apparent moderate to severe degenerative changes of the right shoulder are partially evaluated.
