A right sided dual lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the right atrium, unchanged. Heart size appears at least moderately enlarged, though difficult to completely assess given the presence of moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, not substantially changed in the interval. Worsening moderate pulmonary edema is present. More focal opacities the lung bases may reflect compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
