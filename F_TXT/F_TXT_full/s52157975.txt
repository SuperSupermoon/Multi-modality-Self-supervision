Pulmonary vascular congestion is new but there is no appreciable edema. Moderate left pleural effusion unchanged. Bibasilar atelectasis is moderate but stable. Mild cardiomegaly also stable and unchanged. ET tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Right pleural drain still in place. I think I can see the tip of the temperature probe, which is usually placed in the esophagus, instead at the level of the hypopharynx. House that notified ; details in report of the prior examination.
