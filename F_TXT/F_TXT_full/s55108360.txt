AP chest compared to ___ and ___ at 12:28 p.m.: Following extubation, lung volumes are much lower and this could account substantially for the apparent increased caliber of the mediastinum in the region of the aorta. Some mediastinum bleeding could be present as well. The same is true for small left pleural effusion. On the right with a pleural drain in place, there is no pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax. Right lung shows no pulmonary edema. Left lung has mild edema. Midline drains in place. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the right pulmonary artery, obscured by sternal wire.
