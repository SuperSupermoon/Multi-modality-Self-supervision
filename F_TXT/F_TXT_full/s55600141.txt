As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Moderate cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions, no interstitial abnormalities, in particular non-suggestive of chronic fluid overload. The hilar and mediastinal structures are unremarkable. No evidence of pneumonia.
