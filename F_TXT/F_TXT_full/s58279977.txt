The heart is enlarged. There is upper zone redistribution and increased interstitial markings, as well as more confluent opacity at the left lung base, compatible with CHF. There is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is no gross pleural effusion, though small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax detected.
