There is continued elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with associated left basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis though infection is not excluded. A trace left pleural effusion may be present. Heart size is difficult to assess given the left heart border is obscured, but likely is mildly enlarged. A large hiatal hernia is noted, not changed. Right lung is clear. There is no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax or right-sided pleural effusion is demonstrated. Diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures is noted with marked degenerative changes in the thoracic spine as well as compression deformities of several thoracic vertebral bodies.
