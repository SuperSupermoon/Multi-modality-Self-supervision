The cardiac silhouette size is normal. Worsening areas of opacification are demonstrated within both mid lung fields as well as within the right lung base, findings concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules are obscured due to this new parenchymal process. Mediastinal contours are unchanged with widening of the left superior mediastinal contour compatible with known lymphadenopathy. There is mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified. Emphysematous changes and hyperinflation of lungs are again noted.
