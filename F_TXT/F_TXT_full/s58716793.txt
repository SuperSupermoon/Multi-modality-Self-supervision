Lung volumes are appreciably lower accounting in part for greater radiodensity throughout the lungs, but there is also an increase in pulmonary vascular caliber in the upper lungs suggesting this could be edema. Previous pneumo mediastinum has not progressed and there is less subcutaneous air in the deep tissues of the neck and no pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion may have developed.
