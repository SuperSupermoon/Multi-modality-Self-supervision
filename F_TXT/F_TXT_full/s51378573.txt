In comparison to prior radiograph from several hr earlier, an Impella cardiac assist device is been placed as well as an endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. The side port of the nasogastric tube is not well visualizing could potentially be proximal to the GE junction. Mild cardiomegaly is accompanied by slight improvement an an asymmetrical bilateral pulmonary edema pattern. Bilateral pleural effusions are difficult to compare to the prior study due to positional differences of the patient.
