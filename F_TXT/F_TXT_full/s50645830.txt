As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressure. A pre-existing opacity in the right lung has almost completely resolved. On the left, atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions, a small perihilar opacity and a mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion, persist. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
