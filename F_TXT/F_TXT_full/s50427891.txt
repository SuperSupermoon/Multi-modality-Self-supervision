AP chest compared to ___: With the chin down, endotracheal tube tip position no less than 27 mm above the carina is standard. An upper enteric tube is coiled in the stomach. Severe gaseous distention of the intestinal tract is still quite severe. I would strongly recommend imaging patient upright to detect or confirm what may be a small pneumoperitoneum suggested by the appearance of bowel loops and the lateral aspects of both hemidiaphragms. Dr. ___ was paged. Right lung is clear. Opacification at the left lung base is presumably atelectasis. There is a retrocardiac opacity, probably in the mediastinum, perhaps fluid-filled stomach. Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax.
