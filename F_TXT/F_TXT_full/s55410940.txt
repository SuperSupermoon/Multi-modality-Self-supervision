Portable chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral low lung volumes with assymetry reduction in the left lung volume as well as assymetric increased opacification of left lung density. In the setting of notable left pleural thickening and decreased intercostal spacing, findings are consistent with trapped lung. Focal opacification noted within the lingula corresponds with atelectasis and scarring identified on the ___ CT. No focal opacification evident within the right lung though there may be a small amount of pulmonary edema. The apparent widening of the mediastinum is likely due to medial pleural thickening. The hilar and heart size are unremarkable. Left partial mastectomy evident.
