Right upper lobe opacity is improving with associated decrease in volume loss, with minor fissure now in the expected anatomic position. Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures, limiting assessment of cardiovascular status of the patient. Patchy atelectasis is present in the right lower lobe. Left lung is grossly clear allowing for the low lung volumes.
