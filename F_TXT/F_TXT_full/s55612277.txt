As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in diameter of the pulmonary vasculature and beginning blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting a small pleural effusion, combined to signs of mild pulmonary edema. Unchanged bilateral basal areas of atelectasis. No focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. Unchanged monitoring and support devices. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
