As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with enlargement of the left ventricle. Mild retrocardiac atelectasis. The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. On the right, there is mild paramediastinal widening, potentially caused by an enlarged thyroid with a solitary calcified nodule. Bilateral apical thickening. No evidence of acute changes.
