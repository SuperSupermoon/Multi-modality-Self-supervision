Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette is due to mild cardiomegaly, known pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and engorgement of the vessels. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are again noted associated with bibasilar atelectasis, larger on the left side. Moderate pulmonary edema has minimally improved. There are no new lung abnormalities or pneumothorax.
