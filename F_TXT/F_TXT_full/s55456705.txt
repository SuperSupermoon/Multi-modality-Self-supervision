Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits. There is some crowding of bronchovascular structures in the lung bases, with associated streaky peribronchiolar opacities, likely due to atelectasis, although an aspiration event or peribronchial infection could produce a similar appearance. No segmental or lobar areas of consolidation are evident, and there is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
