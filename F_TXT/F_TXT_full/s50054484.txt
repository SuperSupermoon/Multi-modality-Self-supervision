Portable upright frontal view of the chest. The tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position. The previously seen left central line has been removed. Linear left lung opacites represent scarring that is better characterized on the prior chest CT. The cardiac contour is normal. Right multifocal consolidation and pleural thickening are unchanged. Right lower paratacheal mediastinal buldge likely represents a combination of lymphadopathy and the azygous/right superior intercostal veins.
