Left mediastinal shift is unchanged as well as left retrocardiac consolidation and bronchiectasis that are most likely present. Deviated trachea to the left most likely related to right thyroid enlargement. Left upper lung is overall clear and right lung is clear as well. Overall the findings are concerning for left lower lobe atelectasis, potentially infectious process and bronchiectasis. Correlation with chest CT would be recommended.
