CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. A left chest tube is present. It projects higher over the left lung base on today's examination compared with the exam from ___ at 15:20 p.m. There is a small left effusion and increased consolidation at the left base and left infrahilar region, which are worse compared with the earlier film. Left clavicular and multiple left-sided rib fractures again noted. On the right, there is upper zone re-distribution, but the right lung is otherwise grossly clear, except for minimal atelectasis at the base.
