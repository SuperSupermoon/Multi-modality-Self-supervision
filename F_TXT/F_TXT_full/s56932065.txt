A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an enteric tube coursing below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image, endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, and central line terminating in the right atrium, all unchanged in position. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Bilateral opacities are increased compared to prior chest radiographs from the same day and the day prior. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
