Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits. Emphysema is again seen within the lungs. There are linear opacities in both lung bases compatible with atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely slightly decreased in size. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
