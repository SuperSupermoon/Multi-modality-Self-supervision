Tracheostomy tube, right subclavian central line and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position. The left costophrenic angle is not entirely included. Lungs are somewhat diminished in volume with patchy opacity at the bases suggestive of atelectasis. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax is appreciated. No large effusions. Small metallic densities over the right hemithorax consistent with bullet fragments.
