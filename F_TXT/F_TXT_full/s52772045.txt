There is moderately severe cardiomegaly, with evidence for polychamber involvement. A left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is a small-to-moderate right effusion with some fluid extending into the minor fissure and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is also patchy opacity at the left base, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle. Allowing for differences in positioning, the CHF findings may be somewhat worse. Otherwise, no definite change compared with ___.
