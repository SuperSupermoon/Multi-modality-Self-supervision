Slightly rotated positioning. Compared to the prior study, there has been considerable clearing of the previously seen right apical opacity, suggesting that it represented atelectasis. The right base effusion is probably slightly larger. Again seen is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF, with small right-greater-than- left pleural effusions and underlying bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation. The presence of pneumonic infiltrate at the bases cannot be excluded. Left pigtail catheter, with extensive left-sided subcutaneous emphysema is again noted. No pneumothorax is identified. ET tube the carina is not well delineated, but the ET tube probably lies between 2.9 and 4.1 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. The sideport overlies the stomach. Right IJ line is again seen, tip at cavoatrial junction.
