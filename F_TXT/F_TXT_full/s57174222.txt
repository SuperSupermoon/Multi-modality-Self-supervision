Persistent right upper lobe collapse is more severe compared to the past several days. More rightward shift of the mediastinum suggests that some of the right lower lobe consolidation which has been present for the past several days could have a component of atelectasis as well. Most of the left lung is clear, although of the left apex is obscured by external devices. Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 5 cm from the carina and could be with advanced 15 mm for more secure seating. Esophageal drainage tube ends in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced 5 cm to move all side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Left subclavian central venous line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
