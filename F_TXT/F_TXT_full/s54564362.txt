Interval removal of the right IJ line. No pneumothorax. Lung volumes, the bilateral pleural effusions (which are now only small bilaterally on this study) have improved. The left retrocardiac opacity remains, likely representing atelectasis. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinum and hila are normal.
