As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased, likely caused by decrease in inspiratory effort. As a consequence, there is a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette and crowding of the vascular structures at the lung bases. Unchanged mild displacement of the trachea towards the right caused by a slightly tortuous aortic arch. Status post vertebral fusion at the level of the lumbar spine. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema.
