1. Endotracheal tube now has its tip approximately 1.5-2 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip in the right atrium and a pullback of 6-7 cm would be recommended at this time. 2. Marked interval improvement in aeration at both lung bases with residual linear opacity in the left mid lung reflecting persistence of segmental atelectasis. There is also persistent patchy opacity at the left base which also likely reflects resolving lower lobe atelectasis. The left hilar contour also appears to be somewhat improved on the current study. The right lung has reinflated, and there is a slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, but no focal airspace consolidation noted at the right base at this time. No pneumothorax is seen. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. The patient's nurse ___ was notified of the need to reposition the right IJ line on ___ at 10:11 a.m. by phone.
