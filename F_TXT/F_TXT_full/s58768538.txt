Left lung volume is decreased, likely the result of left lower lobe atelectasis. A small to moderate left pneumothorax may be slightly increased in size from the comparison CT, accounting for differences in technique. A left lung mass now contains a fiducial marker, with well-defined dense consolidation likely reflecting post-treatment change. The cardiac silhouette is unchanged in size, the mediastinal contours are unchanged. The right lung remains clear. The pulmonary vasculature is top normal, accounting for supine technique.
