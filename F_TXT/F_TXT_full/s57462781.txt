There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles which may be due to small pleural effusions and/ or pleural thickening. Right mid to lower lung opacity is seen raising concern for pneumonia. There is also for subtle left base opacity and possible small left upper lobe patchy opacity. Prominence of bilateral perihilar vasculature suggests vascular congestion. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged.
