CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 8:20 a.m., there is increased opacity at both lung bases, with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms. This appears to represent progressive CHF. While it may be accentuated by low lung volumes, the lung volumes are similar to the prior study. There is relative sparing of the upper zone parenchyma. Again noted is a right IJ central line, with tip over lower SVC.
