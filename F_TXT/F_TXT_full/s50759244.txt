Endotracheal tube appears in place at 5.7 cm from the carina. Enteric tube traverses to the stomach. Median sternotomy wires, mitral valve prosthesis, and vascular stents projecting over the region of the brachiocephalic and right subclavian vein appear unchanged. Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear unchanged. There is however a new right basilar opacity with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm which may be due to atelectasis or aspiration. Retrocardiac opacity is again noted and may be representative of atelectasis or infection, possibly due to aspiration. There is no pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions likely persists.
