AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Cardiac enlargement as before, but no increased pulmonary vascular congestion in comparison with the preceding study. The left basal parenchymal density has increased and obliterates the diaphragmatic contour completely. Possibility of coexisting localized pleural effusion in this area cannot be excluded. Comparison of the pulmonary vasculature demonstrates possibly further mild regression of the congestive pattern. On the previous examination, there existed some hazy diffuse density in the left base already, but this appears to have progressed.
