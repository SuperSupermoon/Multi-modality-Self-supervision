In comparison with the earlier study of this date, with the chest tube on waterseal, there is no appreciable change in the small residual pneumothorax. Areas of opacification at the bases are again seen, more prominent on the left, consistent with atelectasis and left effusion. There is persistent subcutaneous emphysema along the right lateral chest wall.
