CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2.9 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film. A right IJ central line catheter is present, tip overlying the right atrium. Clinical correlation regarding possible retraction of the RIJ central line by approximately 4 cm to lie in the distal SVC in the region of the SVC/RA junction. There are low inspiratory volumes. There are increased interstitial markings diffusely throughout the left lung. There are also increased interstitial markings in the right lung, but more pronounced in the right upper lobe. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably not enlarged, allowing for low lung volumes. Compared with ___, there has been some partial improvement particularly in the degree of opacification in the left lung. No gross effusion.
