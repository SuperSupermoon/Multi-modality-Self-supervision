1. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and left subclavian central line remain in place. There has been interval removal of the right basilar chest tube. No pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is slightly diminished given semi-erect positioning. There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with patchy basilar opacity suggestive of atelectasis. There is a persistent retrocardiac consolidation with associated layering effusion most likely representing compressive atelectasis, but again pneumonia should also be clinically considered. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
