Lung volumes are slightly reduced. The heart size is top normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Mild interstitial prominence with peribronchial cuffing could suggest slight vascular congestion or airway inflammation. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis but are nonspecific, and aspiration is not excluded. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
