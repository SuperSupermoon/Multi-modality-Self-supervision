AP chest compared to ___: Previous pulmonary edema has improved. Heterogeneous opacification throughout both lungs has been present since at least ___. Contribution of multifocal pneumonia and atelectasis is indeterminate. Emphysema contributes to heterogeneity to some extent, there is probably a large contribution of retained secretions due to aspiration. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Right subclavian line ends low in the SVC. Very small right apical pneumothorax persists despite the right apical pleural drain. Small pleural effusions are presumed, left greater than right, but not changed recently.
