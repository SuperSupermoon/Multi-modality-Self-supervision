CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Lines and tubes are nominal. Again seen is dense, somewhat patchy opacity in left mid and lower zones. The right lung is grossly clear. No effusion is identified on either side. Appearance is consistent with pneumonia, though, in the appropriate clinical setting, other alveolar processes could account for this appearance.
