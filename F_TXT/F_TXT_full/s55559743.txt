AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Moderate right pleural effusion has increased. Left upper lobe consolidation, which improved from ___ to ___ is unchanged. There is no longer any pulmonary edema. Left lower chest is occupied by abdominal contents due either to a large hernia or severely elevated left hemidiaphragm. Heart is mildly to moderately enlarged but not acutely changed. A right PIC line ends in the mid SVC, ET tube at the thoracic inlet, and a nasogastric tube is looped in the stomach. A fragmented fracture of the medial left clavicle is more evident on this study than previously, but that does not necessarily represent a change.
