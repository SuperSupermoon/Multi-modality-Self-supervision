Right-sided pigtail terminates at the medial right lung base. There has been no significant interval change in the opacification of the mid and lower right lung secondary to large loculated pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis as described on the recent chest CT. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Mild left basilar atelectasis is persistent. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.
