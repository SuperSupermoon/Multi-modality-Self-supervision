There has been interval placement of a right-sided pacer with distal aspect coiling in the region of the right ventricle. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette moderate to markedly enlarged. There is prominence of the hila suggesting pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion is seen, although the right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. No new focal consolidation. No pneumothorax.
