Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Worsening left lower lobe consolidation, likely due to evolving pneumonia. Tubular left upper lobe opacity could reflect localized mucus plugging. New patchy and linear right lower lobe opacities may reflect atelectasis AND aspiration or a new site of infection. Small pleural effusions are present bilaterally. A poorly defined opacity in the left upper lobe has been more fully evaluated by recent CT.
