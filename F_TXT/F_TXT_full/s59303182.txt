There has been interval placement of a chest tube seen at the left lung apex, with kinking. There is interval decrease in the size of left-sided pneumothorax with an apical and medial component remaining. An opacity in the left perihilar region and left lung base likely represents atelectasis. There is extensive subcutaneous edema on the left tracking into the neck. Redemonstrated pneumomediastinum. The right lung is grossly clear with linear atelectasis at the lung base. Multiple left-sided rib fractures demonstrated, better seen on concurrent CT.
