Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There are persistent low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Multifocal lung opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally, are greater on the left; and in the upper lobes, greater on the right. These opacities have minimally increased in the left upper lobe. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is high as before, in the proximal aspect of the stomach and can be advanced for more standard position.
