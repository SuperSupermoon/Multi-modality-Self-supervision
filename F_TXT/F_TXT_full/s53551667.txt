There is increasing left-sided opacification involving the mid to lower lung, probably reflecting increased pleural effusion with associated parenchymal opacity, which is most often due to atelectasis although not specific. There is also a small new right-sided pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity is slightly prominent in the upper lungs, suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension, although without frank congestive heart failure. The patient is status post sternotomy and the heart appears again enlarged.
