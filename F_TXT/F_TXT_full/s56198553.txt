New large pneumoperitoneum. Dr. ___ ___ that the patient had a percutaneous gastrostomy yesterday. Subsequent radiographs will be obtained to determine whether the pneumoperitoneum is increasing or decreasing in volume. Tracheostomy tube is midline. Left lower lobe is still collapsed. Right lower lobe atelectasis is probably substantial as well. Upper lungs are clear and previous moderate pleural effusions are smaller. Heart size is normal. Right PIC line ends low in the SVC. No pneumothorax.
