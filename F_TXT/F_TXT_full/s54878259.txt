Lung volumes are present. Persistent moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is again noted. The mediastinal contours are unchanged, with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta again noted. Fullness of the right paratracheal stripe is also unchanged, and may be due to mediastinal fat deposition, but is longstanding. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Persistent bibasilar airspace opacities are noted, left worse than right, which could reflect atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. There is an elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
