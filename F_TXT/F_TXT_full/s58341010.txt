Lordotic positioning. There is mild cardiomegaly. There is relatively minimal upper zone redistribution. However, there are diffuse increased interstitial markings and vascular blurring, with more confluent opacity at the right base. The appearance is consistent with interstitial and early alveolar edema. Doubt, but cannot entirely exclude, an underlying infectious infiltrate. No gross effusions. No pneumothorax detected.
