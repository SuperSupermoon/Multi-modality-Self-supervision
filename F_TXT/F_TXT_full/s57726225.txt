The endotracheal tube tip sits 5 cm above the carina. The endogastric tube courses inferiorly such that its tip appears to be right at or just below the GE junction, and the side port is well above the GE junction. The heart size is at the upper limits of normal. Mediastinal contours demonstrate enlargement of the central vasculature. The lungs are clear of lobar consolidation, although predominantly basilar and perihilar fluffy opacities are present. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is appreciated. Multiple lateral old healed rib fractures are present bilaterally.
