Although interstitial edema has cleared from the small right lung, moderate to large right pleural effusion has recurred, producing more leftward mediastinal shift. Severe peripheral consolidation in the left lung has been present without appreciable change in the nondependent portion, although some edema has cleared from the base. Differential diagnosis of persistent left lung consolidation is pulmonary hemorrhage or if the ring shadows projecting over the left heart border and left hilus are genuine cavities, multifocal infection. Heart is mildly enlarged. Left pleural effusion minimal if any. No pneumothorax.
