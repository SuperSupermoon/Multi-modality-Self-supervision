ET tube had been pulled back and is now 2.7 cm above carina. Right-sided PICC line and new right subclavian line ends in the lower dilated superior vena cava. NG tube is in the stomach. Mild pulmonary congestion has completely resolved and small bilateral pleural effusions have improved. Severe cardiomegaly in this patient with prior sternotomy and mitral valve repair is most explained by dilation of both atrium.
