1. Persistent low lung volumes with layering bilateral effusions and associated patchy airspace disease, likely reflecting compressive lower lobe atelectasis. In addition, there is mild interstitial edema. Stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours status post median sternotomy. No pneumothorax. Deformity of the right third posterolateral rib, likely related to an old fracture. When compared to the most recent previous study, the interstitial edema has developed, but the pleural effusions are stable.
