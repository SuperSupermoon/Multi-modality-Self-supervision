A right-sided PICC line terminates shortly above the cavoatrial junction. Lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There are small pleural effusions with patchy retrocardiac opacity, most likely due to atelectasis. Streaky opacities in the right upper lung with mild crowding suggest chronic unchanged minor scarring.
