There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. The endotracheal tube appears to be in appropriate position terminating 4.5 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube is seen passing below the diaphragm. There continues to be a right upper and lower lobe opacification and a possible retrocardiac opacity.
