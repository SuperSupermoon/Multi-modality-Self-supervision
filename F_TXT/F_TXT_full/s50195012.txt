Assessment of the thorax is slightly limited by patient rotation and low lung volumes. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax. Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt pulmonary edema. Patchy atelectasis is noted in the lung bases without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Multiple remote left-sided rib fractures are again noted, and spinal fusion hardware spanning the cervicothoracic junction as well as within the lumbar spine is incompletely assessed.
