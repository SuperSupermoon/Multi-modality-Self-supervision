AP chest with the patient standing compared to supine chest on ___: Mediastinal widening is less severe with change in positioning as one would expect since the veins are dilated with the patient supine. Chest CT in ___ demonstrated that the severe mediastinal widening is due to marked fat deposition. The heart is probably normal size, also surrounded by mediastinal fat. Lung volumes are low, but lungs are grossly clear. There is mild engorgement of the upper lobe pulmonary vasculature but no edema. Pleural effusion is small, if any. Of note, the prior chest CT, ___, showed multiple borderline enlarged lymph nodes in the hila and distributed throughout the mediastinum.
