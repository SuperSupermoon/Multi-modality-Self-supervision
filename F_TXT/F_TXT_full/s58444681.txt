1. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC, unchanged. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach. There has been interval improvement in aeration but with residual persistent mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Right hemidiaphragm remains elevated. There is likely bilateral effusions, left greater than right. Persistent retrocardiac opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis in the setting of a layering effusion. Superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pneumothorax.
