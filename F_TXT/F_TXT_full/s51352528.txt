In compared to the prior chest radiograph from earlier today, a right internal jugular central venous catheter remains malpositioned, coursing within the right subclavian vein, as previously communicated to the clinical team caring for the patient and documented on the prior report. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The exam is otherwise remarkable for a possible new small left pleural effusion.
