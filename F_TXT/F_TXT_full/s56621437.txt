AP chest compared to ___ at 3:15 and 4:51 p.m. No change in the relative position of pleural calcifications to the left chest wall to suggest pneumothorax. Greater certainty would be afforded by a right decubitus position looking at the left hemithorax. Severe pleural calcification obscures the lungs. Heart is mildly enlarged.
