Lung volumes are normal. There are bilateral perihilar opacities and reticular markings likely representing septal thickening, all of which are compatible with pulmonary edema. A mass overlies the left lung measuring 3.8 x 3.7 cm, minimally changed in size from chest CT ___. There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles which may be compatible with a trace bilateral pleural effusions Linear opacities overlying both lower lobes likely represent subsegmental atelectasis.
