AP chest compared to ___, 5:12 a.m.: New feeding tube ends distally in the right lower lobe bronchial tree. Subsequent chest radiograph available at the time of this dictation shows successful repositioning in the upper stomach. Previous consolidation questioned in the right upper lobe was probably the function of overlying appliances, rather than real abnormality. Bibasilar atelectasis, moderate on the left and mild on the right is unchanged but moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has increased. Moderate left pleural effusion is stable. ET tube in standard placement. No pneumothorax.
