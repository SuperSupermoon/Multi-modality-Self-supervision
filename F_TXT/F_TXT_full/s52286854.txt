A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an incompletely imaged left chest pacemaker with the single lead overlying the right ventricle. An endotracheal tube in proper position. The right jugular catheter projects over the right mediastinum, but is secondary to patient rotation and confirmed to be in the vein on subsequent CT. There is no pneumothorax. The remainder is unchanged, demonstrating a moderate right pleural effusion.
