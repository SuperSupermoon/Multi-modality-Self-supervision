The ET tube is 5 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. IJ pacer is again seen. There has been interval increase in the alveolar infiltrate, right greater than left, likely due to pulmonary edema with or without superimposed infection. There is a more nodular component seen in the right mid chest and attention should be paid to this region on followup. There continues to be left lower lobe volume loss and left effusion.
