As compared to the previous radiograph, the left lung is slightly better expanded but a pneumothorax is still visible along the left-sided contour of the heart. The multiple displaced rib fractures are constant in appearance. Normal right lung. No pleural effusions. Borderline diameter of the vascular structures could indicate mild fluid overload.
