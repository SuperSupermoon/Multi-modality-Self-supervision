Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.4 cm from the carina. The cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively unchanged. Widening of the right paratracheal stripe is due to the presence of mediastinal fat deposition. Lung volumes are low. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities are noted. There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement. Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally likely reflects extrapleural fat deposition as noted on the prior CT. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities detected.
