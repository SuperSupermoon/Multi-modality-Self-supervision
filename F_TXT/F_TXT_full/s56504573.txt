In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval change. Again there is evidence of severe chronic bronchiectasis, peribronchial infiltration, and severely enlarged hila with consolidation in the left mid to lower lung. The extensive opacification in the right apical region is unchanged. Monitoring and support devices are similar to the previous study.
