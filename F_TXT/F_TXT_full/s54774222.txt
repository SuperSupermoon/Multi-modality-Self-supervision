A new right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is no pleural effusion on the right but there is a suggestion of a small pleural effusion on the left with increased, confluent but focal opacity obscuring the left heart border, probably within the lingula.
