In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an orogastric tube with the tip extending only to the lower thoracic esophagus with the side-port close to the clavicular level. The tube should be pushed forward at least 10 cm for optimal positioning. The tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Otherwise, little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
