Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates stable postoperative changes. There has been mild volume loss of the left hemithorax with resultant leftward shift of the mediastinum. A left IJ catheter tip terminates in the high SVC. A left chest tube is in satisfactory position with no evidence of pneumothorax seen in either lung. Sutures are noted within the right upper lung and left mid lung. The cardiac silhouette is normal. There is no pleural effusion or consolidative process.
