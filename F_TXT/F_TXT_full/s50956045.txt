Endotracheal tube is positioned low within the trachea, only 8 mm above the carina and should be withdrawn at least 2 cm for optimal positioning. ET tube cuff also appears slightly overinflated. Nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of view. Low lung volumes are seen with bibasilar atelectasis and poorly assessed patchy left basal opacity. Cardiac silhouette size is normal with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
