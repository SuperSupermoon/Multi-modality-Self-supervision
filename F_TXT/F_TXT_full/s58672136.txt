In comparison to prior radiograph from 1 day earlier, the side-port of a left chest tube again overlies the lateral left ribs consistent with an extrapleural location. A moderate left pleural effusion has apparently increased in size with adjacent worsening left lower lobe atelectasis. No definite pneumothorax. Marked cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion, slight improvement in pulmonary edema, and persistent moderate right pleural effusion.
