Again noted, similar to the most recent comparisons, is an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Bilateral pulmonary opacity is improved since the most recent exam, consistent with improving edema. Persistent, a bibasilar opacities are present particularly the left, and superimposed infection is not excluded. Right sided opacities are improved. Endotracheal tube tip right central venous catheter tip are in unchanged position. A transesophageal tube is again noted, which extends past the lower margin of the image.
