Compared with ___ at 23:14 p.m., the ET tube lies slightly higher, approximately 4.7 cm above the carina, at the level of the midclavicular heads. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Patchy and more confluent opacities are again seen throughout both lungs, most confluent in the right midzone. Probable small right effusion with pleural thickening and/or layering. No gross left effusion. Thoracic aortic stent, prosthetic valve, new NG tube with tip beneath diaphragm off film, unchanged left subclavian and right IJ lines. As before, the second --___ -- circular structure projects over the lower mediastinum, distinct from the full-circle prosthetic valve.
