1. Endotracheal tube now has its tip at the thoracic inlet, approximately 3 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube continues to have its side port in the distal esophagus and advancement is continued to be recommended. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC. 2. Lung volumes remain low with persistent linear opacity in the right mid lung consistent with subsegmental atelectasis and persistent retrocardiac consolidation which likely represents partial lower lobe atelectasis, although a pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
