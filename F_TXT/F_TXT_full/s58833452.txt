In comparison with the study of ___, the monitor and support devices are essentially unchanged. There is increased haziness of the left hemithorax, consistent with pleural effusion and compressive volume loss involving the left lower lobe. The pulmonary vessels are less distinct, consistent with increasing pulmonary vascular congestion. The area of opacification suggested in the right upper lung on the previous study is now clear, indicating that it had nearly represented overlying scapula.
