Faint right lung interstitial opacities and with stable prominence of the azygos vein are most likely due to pulmonary edema. A bandlike opacity projecting over the right mid lung corresponds to right middle lobe bronchiectasis and atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Stable moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is present.
