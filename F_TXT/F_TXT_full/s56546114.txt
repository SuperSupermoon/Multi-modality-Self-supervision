Portable AP chest radiograph. The left lung base is chronically opacified, likely due to combination of a pericardial fat pad and scarring as shown on prior CT. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is a chronic fracture of the right lateral sixth rib.
