AP chest compared to ___, ___:30 p.m.: Mild pulmonary edema has worsened. Consolidation in the right upper and lower lobes is stable or improved, unchanged at the left lung base. These findings raise concern for a concurrent multifocal pneumonia or atelectasis, perhaps related to aspiration. Heart size mildly enlarged, unchanged. Transvenous right atrial and ventricular pacer leads in standard placements. Small bilateral pleural effusions unchanged. No pneumothorax. I discussed the findings by telephone with Dr. ___ at 9:30 a.m.
