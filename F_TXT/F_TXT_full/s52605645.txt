1. Stable cardiac enlargement, status post median sternotomy for CABG. Interval removal of the gastric tube, endotracheal tube and left internal jugular central line. Persistent streaky opacities in both lungs which may reflect subsegmental atelectasis. In addition, there is perihilar vasculature indistinctness, which likely reflects persistent but improving perihilar edema. No large effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax.
