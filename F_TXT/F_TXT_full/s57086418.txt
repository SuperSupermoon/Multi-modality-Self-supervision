As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes are slightly increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation or a stronger inspiratory effort. Atelectasis at the right lung bases and in the retrocardiac lung areas, however, persist. Coronary stent is better visualized than on the previous image. Unchanged left subclavian catheter. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.
