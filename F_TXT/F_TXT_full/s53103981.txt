The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. The aorta appears unfolded, likely accounting for prominence of the mediastinum. The lung bases, particularly the left, are underpenetrated due to overlying soft tissue. Given this, no definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
