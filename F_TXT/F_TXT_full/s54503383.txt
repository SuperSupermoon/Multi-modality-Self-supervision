Compared to ___, patchy opacity at the left base has increased slightly, with slight interval obscuration of the diaphragm. While this could represent progressive atelectasis, the differential diagnosis could include an early infiltrate or area of aspiration. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle is also seen, though this is not significantly changed. There is also slight patchy opacity at the right cardiophrenic region and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which are similar to the prior film. There is upper zone redistribution, which may be accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No focal infiltrate seen in the upper or mid zones in either lung.
