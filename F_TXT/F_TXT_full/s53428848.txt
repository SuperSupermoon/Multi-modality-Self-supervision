Comparison is made with prior study ___. Extensive bilateral lung opacities have minimally improved on the right upper lobe but worsened in the left lower lobe. There are probably small bilateral effusions. Cardiac size is normal. Mediastinum is unchanged. ET tube is in unchanged standard position. NG tube tip is out of below the diaphragm. Right brachiocephalic/SVC stent is again noted. There is no pneumothorax.
