Lung volumes are low. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged from the recent chest CT allowing for differences in technique. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Focal opacity within the left lower lobe partially reflects the known cavitary mass seen on the previous CT, with probable superimposed infection or atelectasis. Additionally, multiple scattered pulmonary nodules seen on prior CT are not as well assessed on the current exam. Trace left pleural effusion is present. No right pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Innumerable sclerotic metastatic lesions are again seen within the osseous structures.
