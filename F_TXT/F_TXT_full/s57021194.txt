Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and CT torso from ___. The current study demonstrates substantially distended stomach, new finding since the prior study.

Contrast material within the bowel is due to recent administration for assessment of the abdominal structures. Extensive bone deformities are consistent with known osteogenesis imperfecta.
