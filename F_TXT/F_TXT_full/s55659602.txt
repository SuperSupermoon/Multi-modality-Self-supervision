Heart appears to be enlarged as previously seen. There is increased pulmonary vascular congestion, more prominently on the left. There is also slight widening of the upper mediastinum on the right, possibly indicating engorgement of the azygous vein. Although no consolidation is noted, the pattern of pulmonary congestion makes it difficult to exclude an overlying developing infilterate. No pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
