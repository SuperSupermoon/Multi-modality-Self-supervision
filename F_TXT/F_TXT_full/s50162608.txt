Mild interstitial edema may have developed in this patient with emphysema, left upper lobe radiation fibrosis, and extensive bronchial inflammation reflected in bronchial wall thickening and mucoid impaction seen on recent chest CT. Small left pleural effusion may have increased. No pneumothorax. This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. ET tube and left jugular line are in standard placements and a nasogastric drainage tube passes to the distal stomach.
