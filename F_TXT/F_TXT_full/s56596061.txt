In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has taken a better inspiration. Cardiac silhouette is within upper limits of normal in size. No evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. Dual channel pacer device leads again extend to the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle. There has been placement of a right IJ catheter. This is superimposed over the pacer leads so that the tip is difficult to see, though it appears to extend to the mid to lower portion of the SVC. Of incidental note is a deformity of the lower right ribs, most likely related to previous trauma.
