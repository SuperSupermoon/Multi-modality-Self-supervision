Heart size is top normal. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Multifocal interstitial opacities with associated bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening are again noted and reflective of chronic ___ infection, as assessed on the previous CT. There may be minimal new patchy ill-defined opacities within both mid lung fields, which could reflect superimposed acute infection. Lungs remain hyperinflated. Biapical scarring is again demonstrated. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally likely reflect chronic pleural thickening. Clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen are again noted along with pneumobilia.
