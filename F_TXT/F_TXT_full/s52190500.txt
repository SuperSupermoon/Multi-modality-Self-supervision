Both lungs are now globally opacified in a pattern suggesting widespread edema, not necessarily cardiogenic. This obscures the questioned right lower lobe pneumonia and worsening atelectasis as well as the undetermined combination of left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis. Heart is not enlarged. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube and esophageal drainage tube are unchanged in standard positions. Right jugular line ends in the neck as before.
