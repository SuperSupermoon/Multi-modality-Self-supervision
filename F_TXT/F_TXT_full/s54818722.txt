Moderate cardiac enlargement is stable, but pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature are normal and there is no edema. Mild heterogeneous opacification in the retro cardiac left lower lobe could be pneumonia but is more likely atelectasis. Pleural effusion on the left is small if any. No pneumothorax. Dual channel central venous catheter ends in the right atrium.
