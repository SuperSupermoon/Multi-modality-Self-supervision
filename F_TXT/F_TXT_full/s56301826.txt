Left bronchial stent, sternal wires and upper mediastinal drain remain in place. There are stable mediastinal postoperative changes is well. Interval decrease in degree of pneumomediastinum. There is left apical soft tissue which may represent an apical cap, which is not an unexpected finding given recent tracheal surgery. There also continues to be some volume loss on the left given persistent mediastinal shift to the left likely reflecting a component of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Continued followup imaging would be recommended.
