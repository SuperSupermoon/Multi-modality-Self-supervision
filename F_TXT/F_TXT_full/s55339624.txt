As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The patient is in rotated position. Mild cardiomegaly with atelectasis at the left lower lobe, enlargement of the hilar structures and mild increase in diameters of the vascular lung structures, consistent with mild-to-moderate fluid overload. No pneumothorax. The left central venous access line is unchanged in course and position.
