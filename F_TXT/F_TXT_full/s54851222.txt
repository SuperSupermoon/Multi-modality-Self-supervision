The tip of the right internal jugular central venous catheter projects over the cavoatrial junction. The tip of an endotracheal tube projects at the level of the clavicular heads. A feeding tube projects below the level the diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph and a second feeding tube tip projects over the gastric body. Low bilateral lung volumes. Hazy opacities project over both lower lung zones, greater on the right, likely reflective of layering pleural effusions and subjacent atelectasis, greater on the right. No pneumothorax identified. The size and appearance of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
