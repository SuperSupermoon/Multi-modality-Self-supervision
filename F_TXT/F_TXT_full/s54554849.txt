Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes with resultant bronchovascular crowding. Central pulmonary vascular congestion, alveolar opacities, and bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, have improved over the interval. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. No pneumothorax. Left-sided PICC line ends at the mid SVC.
