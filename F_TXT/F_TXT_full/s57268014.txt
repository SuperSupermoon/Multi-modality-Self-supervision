Worsening opacification in the right mid and lower lung regions is accompanied by apparent abrupt cutoff of the distal right main bronchus. These findings are concerning for atelectasis secondary to mucus plugging. Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is also demonstrated. On the left, there is no substantial change in a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and adjacent left retrocardiac atelectasis and/or consolidation.
