Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen, similar in position, with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. There are relatively low lung volumes and scattered areas of minor atelectasis. Chain sutures are noted projecting over the right lung base. No discrete focal consolidation is seen. There is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No large pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
