Comparison is made with prior study ___ and CT abdomen and pelvis performed a day earlier. Almost complete white-out of the right hemithorax is consistent with a very large right pneumothorax with shifting of the cardiomediastinal structures to the left. The left lung is grossly clear. At the time of the interpretation of the study chest tube has been placed in the right chest. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated.
