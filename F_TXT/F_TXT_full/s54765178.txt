Upright portable chest. There is a moderate-sized pneumothorax, predominantly in the right lower thoracic cavity. There is some pleural air at the apex as well. There is an air-fluid level indicative of hydropneumothorax. Multiple rounded opacities are consistent with metastases. There is focal consolidation with air bronchograms in the right upper lobe, consistent with the patient's history of post-obstructive pneumonia. There is a small pleural effusion on the left. A left approach Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction. An abdominal drain can be partially seen in the lower aspect of the image.
