Single frontal portable view of the chest. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.2 cm above the carina. The side port of a nasogastric tube is below the diaphragm. Pulmonary vasculature is ill-defined, compatible with severe pulmonary edema. Hazy opacity overlying both lungs and blunting of the costophrenic angles are compatible with bilateral pleural effusions. No lobar consolidation or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is similar to prior. Leads of a left chest wall pacer terminates in the right atrium and ventricle. Median sternotomy wires and numerous mediastinal clips are intact.
