There is chronic opacity at the right base. Opacities at the left base are also similar and may reflect atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Median sternotomy wires appear intact. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax on this single frontal projection. Slight prominence of interstitial markings may reflect mild pulmonary edema.
