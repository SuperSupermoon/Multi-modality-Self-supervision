The cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by asymmetrically distributed alveolar opacities predominantly in the right lung. Considering bilateral interstitial opacities, small to moderate right pleural effusion, and history of cardiovascular disease, this may represent asymmetrical pulmonary edema. Short-term followup radiographs after diuresis would be helpful to exclude other superimposed process such as aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia.
