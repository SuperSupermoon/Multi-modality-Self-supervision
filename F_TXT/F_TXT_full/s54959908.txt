Low lung volumes persist without focal consolidation. Retrocardiac region is incompletely assessed due to obscuration by battery pack of neural stimulator. Crowding of the vasculature and increased interstitial markings is seemingly unchanged from multiple previous examinations, likely secondary to crowding due to low lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.
