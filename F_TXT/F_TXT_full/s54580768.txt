The lungs are well expanded. There is a dense retrocardiac opacity, with obscuration of the margin of the left hemidiaphragm and descending thoracic aorta, suggestive of left basilar consolidation. Cardiac size is moderately enlarged, not significantly changed from prior exam. No large right pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Dense calcifications of the aorta are reidentified. Left deviation of the trachea and prominence of the upper mediastinum on the right is better assessed in prior CT and secondary to tortuosity of the vessels. Right upper quadrant surgical clips.
