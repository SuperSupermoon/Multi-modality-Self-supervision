A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube and left PICC which are unchanged in position. The tip of the nasogastric tube is within the stomach, but the sideport may still be proximal to the gastroesophageal junction. There has been no recurrence of the left pneumothorax. A right lung consolidation is persistent but improving, and a moderate right pleural effusion is redemonstrated.
