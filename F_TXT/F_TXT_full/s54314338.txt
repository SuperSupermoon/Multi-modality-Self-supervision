The endotracheal tube terminates 7 cm above the level of the carina. Advancement of the ET tube by at least 2 cm to the level of the thoracic inlet is recommended. The tip of a nasointestinal tube terminates in the cervical trachea and needs to be repositioned. The lungs are clear. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. There is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion. Apparent mediastinal widening is likely secondary to the supine AP technique. The cardiac size appears generous, though also likely technical.
