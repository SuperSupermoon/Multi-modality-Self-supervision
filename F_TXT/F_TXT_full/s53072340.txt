As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. There is no evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax. Low lung volumes with areas of platelike atelectasis at the lung bases. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Slightly increased vascular diameters, notably in the perihilar lung regions, could indicate mild pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions.
