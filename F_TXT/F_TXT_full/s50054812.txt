There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter which terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 6 cm above the carina. Bilateral perihilar opacities persist, and appear increased on the left. There is now obscuration of the diaphragms which may be due to pleural effusions and/or atelectasis. No pneumothorax seen.
