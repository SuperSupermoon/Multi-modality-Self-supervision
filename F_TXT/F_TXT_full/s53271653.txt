AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Heterogeneous opacification in both lungs is improving in most areas, but increasing in the axillary region of the left mid lung. Heart size is top normal and mediastinal veins are perpetually dilated. I suspect there is a component of recurrent asymmetric pulmonary edema in the setting of resolving pneumonia. ET tube is in standard placement. Left jugular line ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
