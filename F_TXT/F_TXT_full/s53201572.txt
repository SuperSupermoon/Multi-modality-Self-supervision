Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates a widened vascular pedicle, different in contour than initial radiograph. Subcutaneous emphysema involving both hemithoraces is again seen. The bilateral chest tubes are in place, but tiny left pneumothorax is appreciated and the left tube still impinges on the mediastinum. No pneumothorax is seen on the right. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There is no focal consolidation or pleural effusion.
