Endotracheal tube and enteric tubes are no longer visualized. Lung volumes are lower with linear bibasilar opacities which are likely atelectasis. Lungs are otherwise clear without consolidation or obvious effusion based on a semi supine film. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities.
