AP chest compared to ___, most recently 8:35 p.m.: The right upper pleural fluid loculation may be slightly smaller now than on ___. The loops of the right upper pleural drainage catheter appear less acute. The prior indwelling lower pleural drain is unchanged, with a very small intrathoracic course, and stable small associated pleural loculation or thickening. There is still the suggestion of pneumothorax in the lower hemithorax, some subpulmonic, probably the great bulk in the anterior chest. Lateral view is strongly recommended to assess that. Atelectasis is still quite substantial in the right lower lobe. Left lung and left pleural space are essentially clear and the heart size is normal.
