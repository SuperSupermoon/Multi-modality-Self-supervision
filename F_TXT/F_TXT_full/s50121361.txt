On the abdomen CT performed ___ there were small bilateral pleural effusions and mild interstitial edema. This radiograph shows moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and distension of mediastinal and pulmonary vasculature as well as a more serious interstitial pulmonary abnormality, presumably worsened edema. Because some of the pulmonary abnormality has a micronodular quality, I would recommend conventional radiographs when feasible.
