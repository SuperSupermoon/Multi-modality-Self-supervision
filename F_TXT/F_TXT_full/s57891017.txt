In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip beyond the mediastinal border in the right pulmonary vessels. The tube could be pulled back approximately 6 cm to be within the mediastinal boundaries. The tip of the IABP measures approximately 1.6 cm below the transverse arch of the aorta. Little change in the cardio mediastinal silhouette. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
