The patient is status post median sternotomy. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous. There is mild cephalization of pulmonary vascular markings, likely due to supine positioning. No overt pulmonary edema is present. Minimal patchy opacities are seen in the lung bases, likely reflective of atelectasis. Pleural thickening is seen involving both apices. No large pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen on this supine exam. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
