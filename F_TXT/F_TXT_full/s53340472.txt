Pneumoperitoneum persists, more readily evident on upright images. The tracheostomy tube tip is approximately 3.7 cm from the carina and abuts the tracheal wall. A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC. Two right chest tubes are unchanged in appearance. There is no pneumothorax. Persistent right basilar atelectasis is unchanged. A left pleural effusion and associated atelectasisare stable but accentuated by low lung volumes and positioning. Mild vascular congestion and interstitial edema persist. Moderate enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
