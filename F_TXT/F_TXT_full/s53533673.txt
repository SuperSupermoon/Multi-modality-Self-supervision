In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 5.3 cm above the carina. There is improved aeration of the left hemithorax, though some opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. Opacification at the right base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss on this side as well. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
