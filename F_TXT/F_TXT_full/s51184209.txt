But yesterday's large area of right perihilar consolidation, presumably atelectasis, has cleared. Moderate right pleural effusion and moderate to severe unilateral pulmonary edema are still present. Greater than normal radiodensity of the right hilus is unexplained. If there is concern about acute pulmonary embolism than chest CTA should be requested. Despite progressive elevation of the left hemidiaphragm consolidation of the base of the left lung has improved since earlier on ___. Elevation of the left hilus suggests this is due to substantial left upper lobe atelectasis. Emphysema is severe. ET tube is in standard placement. No definite pneumothorax. Marked left apical pleural thickening is chronic.
