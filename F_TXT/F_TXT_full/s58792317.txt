Status post removal of endotracheal tube. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Persistent moderate-sized partially layering right pleural effusion with adjacent right basilar opacity favoring atelectasis over an infectious pneumonia. Small left effusion and minimal left basilar atelectasis are again demonstrated as well. Small left pleural effusion versus pleural thickening with adjacent minimal linear left basilar scar.
