There is an endotracheal tube approximately 4 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube is present with the tip below the left hemidiaphragm with the tip out of field-of-view. A right Port-A-Cath is present with its tip near the atriocaval junction. Again there is near-complete opacification of the right lung, not significantly changed from the prior exam. This is due to combination of pleural effusion and consolidation. At the left base, the opacity has increased in size, which is most consistent with a worsening pneumonia. The left upper lung zone remains clear. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, and normal.
