Single portable upright frontal image of the chest. There has been interval increase in the opacity of the right lung base, which could represent atelectasis but is concerning for pneumonia or aspiration. The pulmonary vasculature is slightly more prominent than on prior exam and there are increased interstitial markings, consistent with mild pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
