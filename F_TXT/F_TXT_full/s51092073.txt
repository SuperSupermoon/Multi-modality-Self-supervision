In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been a thoracentesis with removal of a large amount of pleural fluid. Although there is a suggestion of a pleural line in the right apex. Normal vessels appear to extend beyond it and therefore there is no definite pneumothorax. Moderate pleural effusion is seen on the left. Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen.
