Comparison is made with prior study, ___. ET tube tip is low, only 18 mm above the carina, should be withdrawn 2 cm for more standard position. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC. There is no evident pneumothorax. Moderate-to-large right and small left pleural effusions are probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has worsened. Right lower lobe atelectasis has increased. Left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
