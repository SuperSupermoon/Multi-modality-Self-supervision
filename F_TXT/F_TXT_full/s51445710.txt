AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Marked cardiac enlargement unchanged. Unchanged position of previously described left-sided permanent pacer with dual intracavitary electrode system. The pulmonary congestive pattern persists and may even have increased. The lateral pleural sinuses are only mildly blunted but it is likely that the pleural effusions are layering posteriorly as the patient is in marked recumbent position. No pneumothorax identified.
