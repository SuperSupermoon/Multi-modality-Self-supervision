The lung volumes are low, though there is no focal airspace opacity or evidence of pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous and calcified, similar to the prior exam. The heart size is at the upper limits of normal. Again, there is dislocation of the right humerus with a displaced fracture through the mid shaft. This is unchanged from the prior exam.
