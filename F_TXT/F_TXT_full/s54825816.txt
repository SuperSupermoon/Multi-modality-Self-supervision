Enteric tube is noted traversing to the stomach. Dual-lead pacemaker appears in place. Lung volumes are low. In comparison to the prior study, there are bilateral increased interstitial opacities, consistent with worsening pulmonary edema. Bilateral small pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis persist. There is however increased opacification of the right lower lobe which may represent atelectasis versus an early infectious process. The upper lung fields remain clear. Cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stable. There is no pneumothorax.
