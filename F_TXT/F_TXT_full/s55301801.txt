Single portable view of the chest. Relatively low lung volumes are seen. There is secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings with possible superimposed pulmonary vascular engorgement. Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged, but likely accentuated by technique and low lung volumes. Hypertrophic changes are noted in the spine. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior cholecystectomy.
