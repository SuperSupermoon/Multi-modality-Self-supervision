As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral parenchymal opacities, notably on the left, have moderately increased, emphasize inter suspicion for pneumonia. In addition, there is an increase in diameter of the vascular structures and an increase in interstitial markings, likely reflecting a component of pulmonary edema. Bilateral blunting of the costophrenic sinuses, likely reflecting pleural effusion. The monitoring and support devices are in constant position.
