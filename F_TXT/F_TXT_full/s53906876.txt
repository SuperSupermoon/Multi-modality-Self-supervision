There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter with tip located in the proximal right atrium. No pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low which causes crowding of bronchovascular structures and persistent widening of the superior mediastinal contour. Heart size is exaggerated as result of low lung volumes, appearing mild to moderately enlarged. There is no overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion is detected. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
