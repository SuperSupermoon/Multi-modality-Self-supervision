As before, there is a persistent retrocardiac opacity which may represent atelectasis or infection. The lungs are otherwise clear aside from moderate emphysesma. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. No pleural effusion. Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally may represent a small amount of pleural fluid.
