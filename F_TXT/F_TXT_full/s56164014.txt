Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. The heart remains enlarged with a left ventricular prominence. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified on the current study. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. There may be some cephalization of the pulmonary vascularity consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension, although no overt pulmonary edema. Lung volumes are slightly lower and there is patchy opacity at the right base which most likely reflects patchy atelectasis, although an early pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.
