Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged. There are patchy and streaky opacities at both bases which more likely reflect atelectasis rather than aspiration or pneumonia but clinical correlation is advised. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. No large effusions. Multiple left-sided old rib fractures are seen.
