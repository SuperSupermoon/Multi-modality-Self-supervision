There has been interval placement of intra-aortic balloon pump, with radiopaque tip projecting over the descending aorta at the level of the left mainstem bronchus; this could be advanced forward approximately 3 cm for ideal positioning. The patient is now intubated, with distal tip of ET tube projecting below the level of the clavicles, approximately 4.8 cm above the carina. A right IJ central catheter is again seen with distal tip in stable position in the mid SVC. The cardio mediastinal silhouettes are stable in appearance, with re-demonstrated cardiomegaly. There is improvement in the appearance of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is evidence of persistent probably small bilateral pleural effusions, posteriorly layering on the current film. There is relaxation atelectasis of bilateral lower lobes as seen previously. There is no pneumothorax.
