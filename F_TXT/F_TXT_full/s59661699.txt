The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. A 17 mm nodular opacity projecting over the left upper lobe corresponds to a calcified pleural plaque within the left anterior chest, as seen on the prior CT. Streaky right basilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are cholecystectomy clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. No free intraperitoneal air is seen under the diaphragms.
