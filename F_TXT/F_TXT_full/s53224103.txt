1. Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular central line, left internal jugular large-bore catheter and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position, although the tip of the nasogastric tube is not identified on the current study. An esophageal probe continues to have its tip in the proximal esophagus. There continues to be small layering effusions, right greater than left, with increasing consolidation at the right base which may represent worsening atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There is also likely patchy opacity at the left base which could represent atelectasis or pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given portable technique and differences in patient positioning. Since the prior study, the pulmonary edema has improved but the bibasilar airspace process has worsened.
