A small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged from the immediate prior study, allowing for differences in patient positioning. There has been interval removal of a right basilar pigtail catheter with an unchanged small right pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema are similar to the prior study. A left pectoral single lead pacemaker projects in unchanged location with the lead projecting over the left ventricle. The osseous structures and upper abdomen are unremarkable.
