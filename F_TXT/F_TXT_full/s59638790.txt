A single portable supine radiograph of the chest and upper abdomen were obtained. The exam is limited by the presence of the trauma board. An endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina. Right medial basilar pulmonary opacities are better seen on the subsequently obtained chest CT. There is no additional consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax present. There is horizontal linear atelectasis at the left base. No displaced fracture is apparent.
