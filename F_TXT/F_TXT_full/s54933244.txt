1. The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Lung volumes have somewhat improved and there continue to be some streaky opacities at both bases which could reflect areas of atelectasis, although bibasilar pneumonia should also be considered. There is likely a layering left effusion. The perihilar vasculature is somewhat prominent, but there is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema. No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is somewhat diminished given supine technique. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
