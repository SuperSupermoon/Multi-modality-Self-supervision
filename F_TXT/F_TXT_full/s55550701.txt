Lung volumes are low. There is pulmonary vascular congestion and hilar enlargement suggestive of volume overload. Additionally, there is opacification of the left lung base, which correlates with atelectasis and a moderate effusion seen on concurrent CT abdomen/pelvis. Asymmetric radial opacities originating from the left hilus may be due to lymphatic engorgement due to congestion. However, consider repeat radiograph after diuresis/drainage to ensure resolution. If finding persists, CT is warranted to exclude underlying mass. No pneumothorax is evident. Mild cardiomegaly is noted.
