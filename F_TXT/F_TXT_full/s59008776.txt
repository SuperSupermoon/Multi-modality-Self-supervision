The lungs are hyperinflated. There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or frank pulmonary edema. Biapical pleural thickening is noted. An oval calcified density is noted within the right lung apex overlying the right scapula and portions of the posterior right fourth rib, likely of little clinical significance. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
