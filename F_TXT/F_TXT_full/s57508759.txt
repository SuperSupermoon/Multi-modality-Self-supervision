There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or appreciable pulmonary hemorrhage if any. Right lung volume is larger now and aeration has improved at the left lung base, compared to earlier today. These developments could be due to either pneumatocele formation, air trapping, or increase positive pressure ventilation, perhaps even improvement in the diffuse pulmonary abnormality. Heart size is normal. ET tube and esophageal drainage tube are in standard placements.
