Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are small patchy right upper lung opacities, which in the setting of trauma could be due to pulmonary contusion or aspiration. The findings appears slightly more prominent as compared to the prior study. Recommend followup to resolution to exclude an underlying lesion. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette a wet is top-normal to mildly enlarged. No large pleural effusions are seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is biapical pleural thickening. There may be a minor pulmonary vascular congestion. The right posterior lateral 7th rib is appears to take a sharp angle, which may be due to a fracture of indeterminate age.
