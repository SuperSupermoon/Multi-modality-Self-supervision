AP chest compared to ___: Pulmonary edema worsened from ___ through ___, and has remained relatively stable since although there is more opacification in the right lower hemithorax which could be posterior pleural effusion layering in the supine patient. Supine positioning probably accounts for some increase in pulmonary vascular congestion in the upper lungs though moderate cardiomegaly is stable and there is no mediastinal vascular engorgement to speak of. A large bore catheter still cannulates the azygous vein. ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
