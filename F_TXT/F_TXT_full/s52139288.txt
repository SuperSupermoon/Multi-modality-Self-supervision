The patient is rotated rightward somewhat limiting the evaluation. Within these limitations, the lungs are relatively well expanded. There is no definite focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis seen on prior CT. The heart is not enlarged. Although difficult to evaluate, the mediastinal and hilar contours are likely stable.
