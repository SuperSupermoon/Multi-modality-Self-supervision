As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. The lung volumes are low. The size of the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there is an increase in diameter of the pulmonary vasculature in the perihilar areas, suggesting mild pulmonary edema. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis is constant in appearance. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
