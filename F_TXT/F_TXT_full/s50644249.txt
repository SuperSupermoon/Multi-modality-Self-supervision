Compared with the prior study, an ET tube is now in place, tip 7 point 7 cm above the carina, at the level of the mid clavicular heads. An NG tube is present, tip over fundus. A pericardial drain is noted. The right IJ sheath is present, tip over proximal SVC. There are low inspiratory volumes. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, likely related to background enlargement, as well as low inspiratory volumes, AP technique and interval intervention. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation all and minimal atelectasis at the right lung base. The left hemidiaphragm remains visible. No CHF. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle. No gross effusion. No pneumothorax detected.
