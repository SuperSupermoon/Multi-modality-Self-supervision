Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The left central venous line tip is at the level of low SVC. The esophageal stent is in place. The right pigtail catheter is in place. There is slight interval improvement in right basal consolidation. There is potential minimal amount of pneumoperitoneum given the lucency projecting at the level of the diaphragm, although potentially it might represent summation of shadows. This area was not clearly seen on the prior radiograph and should be further followed on the subsequent examinations.
