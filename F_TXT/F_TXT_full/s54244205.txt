AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 5:42 a.m.: Pulmonary edema has been fluctuating, now moderate and improved since 5:42 a.m. Lower lobes are consistently more consolidated than elsewhere, usually due to dependent edema and atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is presumed. Heart is enlarged but cardiac borders are substantially obscured by adjacent abnormalities, while upper mediastinal widening due to dilated central veins has definitely improved. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. Left subclavian line ends in the upper SVC. Right pleural tube still in place. No pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
