As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the proximal parts of the stomach. The very extensive left-sided parenchymal opacities are unchanged, in the right lung, there is a slight improvement in ventilation, as documented by a decrease in extent of the basal opacities and basal pleural effusion. No complications, notably no pneumothorax.
