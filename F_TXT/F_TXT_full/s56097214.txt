There is nearly total opacification of both lungs. Cardiac size is normal. Apparent widening of the mediastinum is likely secondary to positioning to supine position. No pneumothorax or pleural effusions are seen. An endotracheal tube ends 3.5 cm above the carina. An esophageal tube has its tip and side port within the stomach. A line crossing across the left upper lung with its tip projecting over the cardiac shadow is likely external.
