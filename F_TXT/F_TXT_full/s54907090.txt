As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been receiving a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not included on the image. There is increasing opacification of the basal and left parts of the left hemithorax, likely caused by a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. The extent of ventilated left lung parenchyma is minimal. Moderate cardiomegaly. The opacity that pre-existed at the right lung base is smaller and less severe than before.
