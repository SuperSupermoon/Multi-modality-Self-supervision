AP chest compared to ___: Change in mediastinal contour, a new bulge encompassing the aortic arch could be due to overlying structure rather than a real change in mediastinal anatomy, one which would suggest acute aortic aneurysm. I recommend a repeat chest radiograph, with the patient as erect as possible to re-evaluate this and that would also help explain the new veil-like shadow which could represent new consolidation in the left lower lobe superior segment. Basal segments remain partially atelectatic. Residual edema is mild, confined to the right lower lung. Heart is top normal size. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube and right internal jugular line and an upper enteric drainage tube are in standard placements. Contrast agent outlines a non-distended stomach. Dr. ___ was paged and we discussed these findings.
