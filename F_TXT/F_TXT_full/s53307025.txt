Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The right central venous line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Right basal opacity and left upper lobe opacity are unchanged. It might be consistent with diffuse infectious process, but overall unchanged since prior study.
