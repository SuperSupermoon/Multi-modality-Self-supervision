Cardiac silhouette is moderately to severely enlarged. Drainage catheter projects over the cardiac silhouette. Small left pleural effusion is likely. No pneumothorax. Left perihilar opacification could be edema or atelectasis, particularly if the pericardial effusion, prior drainage, was much a larger. Followup advised to monitor either pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage which could also look the same.
