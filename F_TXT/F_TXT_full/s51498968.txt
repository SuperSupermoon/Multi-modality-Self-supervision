Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with persistent moderate to large loculated right pleural effusion with a dominant loculated component within the right major fissure, unchanged. Moderate partially loculated left pleural effusion has improved, along with an adjacent area of atelectasis at the left lung base. Heterogeneous opacities in the right lower lung have also slightly improved and may reflect a combination of pneumonic consolidation and interstitial edema.
