Frontal supine portable radiograph of the chest. There are low lung volumes. The mediastinum appears widened, possibly accentuated by positioning and low lung volumes; however, mediastinal injury is not excluded. Round opacity in right infrahilar region was also present on the prior radiograph and is now partially obscured by adjacent atelectasis. Lucency adjacent to right cardiomediastinal contour could potentially represent a right anteromedial pneumothorax. Bibasilar retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis. Consider CT for further evaluation of the mediastinum and questionable pneumothorax, as well as a round opacity below the right hilum.
