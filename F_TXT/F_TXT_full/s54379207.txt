Persistent cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion. Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion has increased in size, but a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion appears slightly decreased. Adjacent areas of atelectasis are present in both lower lobes. Additionally, there is a questionable area of new consolidation in the right mid lung region, somewhat difficult to differentiate from the adjacent pleural effusion. Attention to this region on a short-term followup radiograph would be helpful to exclude an acute pulmonary process such as aspiration or a developing pneumonia in this region.
