An endotracheal tube terminates 2.1 cm above the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view on this image. The lungs appear slightly hyperinflated. There is hazy opacification of the left lung base with silhouetting of the left costophrenic angle suggesting a small left layering pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis. There maybe trace right pleural effusion. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. There is mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with calcification of the aortic knob.
