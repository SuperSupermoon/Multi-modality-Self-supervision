As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing left pleural effusion has moderately increased. There is a new small right pleural effusion. Bilateral areas of atelectasis are visualized. In addition, there is a minimal increase in radiodensity at the basis of the right upper lobe, potentially reflecting a developing pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly persists in unchanged manner.
