Compared with the immediate prior study, the small right apical pneumothorax and trace left apical hydropneumothorax are unchanged. There is persistent severe swelling at the surgical site at the level of the clavicles with leftward tracheal deviation. Decreased lung volumes on the right cause right basilar atelectasis, and there may be a new small left pleural effusion. The enteric tube ends within the remnant esophagus. A right-sided chest tube and a left paravertebral JP drain are in unchanged positions. There are no focal consolidations or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
