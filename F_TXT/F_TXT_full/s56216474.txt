New endotracheal tube terminates 1.7 cm above the carina. There is worsening moderate pulmonary edema, now with central vascular engorgement as well as ___ A and B lines. Right upper and bilateral lower lobe opacities persist. Relative increase in right upper lobe density in this short time interval likely represents redistribution of edema. Moderate cardiomegaly is present. Prosthetic mitral valve and median sternotomy wires. Probable small pleural effusion, though the right costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.
