Interval placement of a nasogastric tube which has its tip projecting over the stomach but the side port is at the gastroesophageal junction. Advancement by approximately 5 cm should be considered. Femoral Swan-Ganz catheter unchanged in position with its tip likely in the pulmonary outflow tract. An intra-aortic balloon pump remains in place with the tip approximately 2.5 cm below the top of the aortic knob. Heart remains mildly enlarged. There has been interval improvement in the parenchymal airspace opacities suggestive of resolving edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
