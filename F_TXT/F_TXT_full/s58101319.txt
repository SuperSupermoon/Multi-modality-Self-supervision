Single frontal view of the chest. The heart size is mildly enlarged and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. The bilateral costophrenic angles are indistinct, potentially due to effusions or potentially in part due to overlying soft tissues and technique. Retrocardiac opacity could represent atelectasis or consolidation. No pneumothorax.
