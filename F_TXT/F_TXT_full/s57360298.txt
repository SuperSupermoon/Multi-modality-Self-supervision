In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a better inspiration. There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Continued opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. Again, as this has been a persistent finding, CT should be considered to search for an underlying mass or central bronchial lesion.
