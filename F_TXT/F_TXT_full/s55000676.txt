Comparison was made with prior study performed same day earlier. Dobbhoff tube tip is in the stomach. It is not post-pyloric. Tracheostomy tube is in a standard position. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Emphysema bullous changes, irregular opacities in the left upper lobe and atelectasis in the lower lobes bilaterally are unchanged. Opacities in the lower lobe could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded. Left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema has minimally increased. Left PICC tip is in the mid to lower SVC.
