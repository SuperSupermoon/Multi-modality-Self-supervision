In comparison with the earlier study of this day, the right chest tube remains in place and there is no pneumothorax. There is some increasing opacification at the right base with continued opacification at the left base, consistent with pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis on both sides. The degree of subcutaneous gas at the right base appears to have increased.
