AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are appreciably lower, mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is new, pulmonary vascular congestion is new, although there is no pulmonary edema, and there is a small pleural or extrapleural hematoma associated with left upper lateral rib fractures. I see no pneumothorax. Right PIC line ends low in the SVC.
