Overall, appearances are very similar when compared to the prior study. Even allowing for the projection, the heart is enlarged. There is persistent opacity at the left lung base likely reflecting a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. The right upper lobe consolidation is not as clearly seen as on the prior study. No pneumothorax seen.
