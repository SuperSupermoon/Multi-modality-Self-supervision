The lung volumes are low, limiting assessment. Within the limitations, there is no focal airspace opacity or pulmonary edema. There is a possible small right pleural effusion. There is no definite left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. A pacemaker/ICD overlies the left chest with the leads overlying the expected location of the right atrium and the right ventricle. Sternotomy wires are intact. Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant, likely from a prior cholecystectomy. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated in comparison to the left.
