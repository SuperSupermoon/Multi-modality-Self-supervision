Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina. The pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and right ventricle. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is interval improvement of pulmonary edema, currently minimal. There is no substantial pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax. Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid low SVC. Linear opacities projecting over the pacemaker are new and most likely represents overlying findings , and unlikely to represent discontinued pacemaker leads but repeated radiograph to clarify this point is recommended.
