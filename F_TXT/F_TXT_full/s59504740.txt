Single semierect frontal view of the chest demonstrates a left pectoral pacer/AICD with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. The lung volumes are low, accentuating cardiomegaly. There is no vascular congestion. Equivocal opacity in the left costophrenic angle correlates with consolidation on subsequent CT. The right lung is clear.
