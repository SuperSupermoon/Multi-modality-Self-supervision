The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is new opacity projecting over the right lower lung accompanied with volume loss including a band-like opacity that is fairly typical for atelectasis; however much of the opacity is ill-defined. The left lung appears clear with resolution of opacity in the left costophrenic sulcus. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A prior right posterolateral ninth rib fracture appears unchanged.
