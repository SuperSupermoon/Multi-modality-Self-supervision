Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Diffuse tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is probably unchanged allowing for differences in lung volumes. However, if there is a concern for aortic dissection based on clinical symptoms of back pain and hypotension, dedicated CT angiogram study would be recommended to more fully evaluate the aorta. Patchy opacities at the lung bases, right greater than left, likely represent atelectasis, and note is made of a persistent small right pleural effusion.
