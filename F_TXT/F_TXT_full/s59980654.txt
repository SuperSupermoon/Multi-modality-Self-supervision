Single frontal image of the chest. Retrocardiac opacity, possibly representing atelectasis but cannot exclude pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting. The left costophrenic angle not well visualized, likely representing a small pleural effusion. The lungs are otherwise hyperexpanded but clear. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
