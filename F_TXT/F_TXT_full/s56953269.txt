No previous images. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged heart. Pulmonary vascularity is essentially within normal limits. Blunting of the costophrenic angles with hazy opacification at the bases suggests some pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis at the base. There is somewhat elliptical opacification in the region of the right cardiophrenic angle, worrisome for a mass. Comparison with previous images would be most helpful. A relatively dense vertical opacification just lateral to the descending aorta could well represent previous fibrosis.
