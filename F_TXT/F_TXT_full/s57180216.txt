The lungs are well expanded. There has been a significant interval improvement of bilateral alveolar opacities present on ___. There are some residual streaky opacities in the retrocardiac space which are likely from atelectasis. No pleural effusions are identified. Previous blunting of the right cardiophrenic angle has completely resolved. There is no pneumothorax. Of note, there is an unusual curvilinear opacity tracking along the right margin of the mediastinum of unclear significance. There might be mild cardiomegaly, although assessment is limited in this AP exam. An old posterior rib fracture of the left sixth rib is present.
