Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. Cardiac size is top normal. Mildly widened mediastinum is unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusions larger on the right side are stable. Extensive bilateral lung opacities larger on the right lung are unchanged. These are likely due to pulmonary edema, but superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded.
