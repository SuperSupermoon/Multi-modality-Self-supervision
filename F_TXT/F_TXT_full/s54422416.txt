AP view of the chest. There is a new diffuse hazy opacity of the right hemithorax as well as fluid in the minor fissure. A hazy opacity overlying the left lower hemithorax is also seen. These likely represent new pleural effusions layering posteriorly given that the patient is semi supine. No pneumothorax. No definite focal consolidation. Cardiomediastinal hilar contours are stable. Mitral annular calcifications are seen. Tiny amount of pneumomediastinum in the left neck and adjacent to the aortic arch. Stent is seen in the thoracic aorta and kyphoplasty changes are seen in the upper lumbar spine. Left-sided pacemaker wires are unchanged in position.
