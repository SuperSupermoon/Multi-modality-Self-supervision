ET tube present, tip approximately 0.1 cm above the carina. NG tube present, tip and side-port beneath diaphragm, with tip extending beyond film. Right IJ central line tip overlies the proximal SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar, possibly slightly decreased in size. Retrocardiac density is significantly improved, with negligible residua. Minimal subsegmental atelectasis at both bases noted. Hazy opacity at the right costophrenic angle could reflect a small right effusion. Minimal blunting left costophrenic angle remains present, improved compared with previously seen left effusion. Rounded opacity overlying the left lung base is noted, question nipple shadow. (Review of chest x-ray from ___, suggests that this represents a nipple shadow). Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
