In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. There is decreased opacification bilaterally, consistent with improving aspiration pneumonia. Some indistinctness of vessels could reflect some elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Specifically, there is no evidence of free intraperitoneal gas. However, this is not truly an upright image, so that small pneumoperitoneum could easily be missed. If this is a serious clinical concern, a true upright view could be obtained or CT performed.
