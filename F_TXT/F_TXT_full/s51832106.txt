AP portable upright radiograph demonstrates an enteric tube which descends the thorax in an uncomplicated course. For proper placement within the gastric lumen, recommend advancing 3 cm. Lungs are hyperexpanded with flattening of the diaphragms suggestive of emphysema. Lungs are clear without a focal opacity convincing for pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities detected. Clips project over the mid upper abdomen. Dilated loops of small bowel are noted projecting over the upper quadrant. No air to the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
