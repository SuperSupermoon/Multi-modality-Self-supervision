Lung volumes are grossly normal however there is diffuse hazy opacity bibasal E likely reflecting layering pleural effusions. Bilateral basal airspace opacity likely therefore represents a atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded. Even allowing for the projection, the heart appears mildly enlarged. Possible pulmonary vasculature consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion. Difficult to exclude pulmonary edema given the pleural effusions. No pneumothorax seen.
