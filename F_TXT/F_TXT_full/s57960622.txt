Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip at the thoracic inlet. There is increasing opacity at the left upper lobe with shift to the left favoring left upper lobe collapse, although superimposed infection or a central mass cannot be excluded. Patchy bibasilar opacities are also seen possibly representing atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no overt pulmonary edema. Heart is are stable in size given differences in patient positioning.
