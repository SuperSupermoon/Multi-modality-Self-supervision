Increasing bibasilar opacities which would be concerning for aspiration or a worsening infectious process. There is also a persistent diffuse reticulonodular interstitial abnormality which likely is not significantly changed. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Right subclavian PICC line and tracheostomy tube are in unchanged position. Severe degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint. No evidence of pneumothorax. No large effusions, although there is some blunting of the left costophrenic angle which could reflect a small effusion.
