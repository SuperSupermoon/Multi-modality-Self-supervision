Lung volumes are slightly improved when compared to the prior study with increased aeration of the right lung base. A previously seen right pleural effusion appears to have decreased however there is new airspace opacity seen in the right middle and right lower lobe. This may reflect re-expansion pulmonary edema however infection cannot be excluded. Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with background congestive heart failure. Left basilar atelectasis. Deformity of the right shoulder consistent with an old fracture.
