AP chest compared to ___: Mild generalized edema has not worsened appreciably over the past two days, but there is greater consolidation in the left lower lobe, with some elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and leftward mediastinal shift suggesting a substantial component of atelectasis. This could be due to retained secretions or aspiration and puts the patient at risk for developing pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Pleural effusion is minimal if any. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard placement, right internal jugular line ends in the right atrium and an upper enteric drain passes into a nondistended stomach and out of view.
