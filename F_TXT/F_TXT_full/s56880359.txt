There is stable moderate to severe cardiomegaly with normal vasculature, suggesting possible pericardial effusion or cardiomyopathy. The retrocardiac opacification appears less dense, suggesting improvement of atelectasis or consolidation. There is likely a small to moderate left pleural effusion, and a small right pleural effusion. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pneumothorax. There is probably an old, well healed fracture of the left anterior second rib.
