Semi-portable chest radiograph is provided. A right PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Compared to the prior exam, there has been progression of pulmonary edema, now worse at the lung apices. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are constant. The heart remains enlarged, although definite borders are difficult to ascertain. Apparent leftward displacement of aortic knob calcifications is likely due to patient rotation as the aorta now projects over the spine. Clips are noted at the left upper quadrant.
