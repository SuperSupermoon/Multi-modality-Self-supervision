Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Bilateral asymmetrically distributed combined alveolar and interstitial opacities have worsened in the interval and continue to be more severe in the right than the left lung. This could represent asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but underlying pneumonia in the right lung is also a possibility. Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are present. Note is also made of intraperitoneal air, a finding in keeping with the patient's recent abdominal surgery, as discussed by telephone with ___ ___ at 9:05 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.
