The overall appearance of the hiatal hernia and patchy basilar opacities remains similar to the prior film. No infiltrate or progressive consolidation is seen. There is mild upper zone re-distribution, possibly slightly more than on the earlier film, but no overt CHF. Cardiomediastinal contour remains unchanged.
