As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina. The patient has also received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not displayed on the image. A pre-existing pleural effusion on the right, combined to an area of parenchymal opacity has decreased. The opacity has also decreased in extent and severity. Both changes, however, are still clearly visible. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No left pleural effusion.
