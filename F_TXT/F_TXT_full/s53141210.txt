Compared with the prior studies, lung volumes are significantly decreased, with bronchovascular crowding and accentuated heart size. Left basilar opacity is likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion. Significant amount of subcutaneous air is present throughout the bilateral thoracic soft tissues, postoperative in nature. The large right paratracheal lymph node is again seen, similarly to prior chest radiographs and the prior chest CT. No evidence of pneumothorax.
