In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there are slightly better lung volumes. The hemidiaphragms are more sharply seen, which could either reflect some improvement in pleural fluid or a more erect position of the patient when the examination was obtained. Atelectatic changes persist at the bases. No evidence of pulmonary edema or acute focal pneumonia.
