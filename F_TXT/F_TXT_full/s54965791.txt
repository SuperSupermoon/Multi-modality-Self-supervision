Following left thoracentesis, a left pleural effusion has substantially decreased in size with only a small pleural effusion remaining. A smooth very small left apical pneumothorax is present and subsequently expands on separately dictated chest radiograph under clip ___, for which documentation of communication is provided (both radiographs are being interpreted concurrently). Associated improved aeration of the left lung with nonspecific left perihilar airspace opacities which may reflect re-expansion edema. A moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged.
