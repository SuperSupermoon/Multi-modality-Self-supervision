AP chest compared to ___. Tip of the endotracheal tube at the upper margin of the clavicles is no less than 4.5 cm above the carina, with the patient's chin partially flexed. It could be advanced 2 cm for more secured seating in the airway. Moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement have both increased, there is probably a small right pleural effusion, and although there is pulmonary vascular congestion, I do not see pulmonary edema. Transvenous right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective positions, but it appears that one is detached proximally from the pacemaker.
