ETT is in standard position. Right internal jugular vein catheter tip is unchanged in position. Left is PICC line upper SVC. Bilateral consolidation, greater on the right upper lung may reflect a component of edema in the setting of mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and volume overload that is overall unchanged. Possible superimposed pneumonia in the right upper lung cannot be excluded as over the days, this consolidation is relatively stable, less typical of pneumonia. Day-to-day changes in left consolidations are likely edema. Small left pleural effusions overall unchanged. No pneumothorax. The heart size is normal.
