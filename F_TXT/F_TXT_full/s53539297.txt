The heart is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. There is patchy left mid to lower lung opacity. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is seen. Bilateral paratracheal opacity in the upper mediastinum without indentation on the trachea may relate to prominent vasculature. The lungs are relatively hyperinflated. Relative lucency of the upper lungs is seen; combination of findings suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thoracic scoliosis is noted. Pigtail catheter is noted overlying the right upper quadrant.
