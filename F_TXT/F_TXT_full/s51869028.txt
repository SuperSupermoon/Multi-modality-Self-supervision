Support lines and devices are in standard position. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged with left ventricular configuration. Bilateral confluent areas of airspace opacification are again demonstrated, likely due to multifocal pneumonia. They are located centrally in the left perihilar region, and more diffusely in the right middle and right lower lobes, with interval worsening on right. Additional opacity in left retrocardiac region shows slight improvement from the prior study. Right upper lobe is relatively spared of this process peripherally, but poorly defined central opacities likely reflect coalescing foci of airspace disease. Moderate right pleural effusion has increased in size from the prior study, and small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
