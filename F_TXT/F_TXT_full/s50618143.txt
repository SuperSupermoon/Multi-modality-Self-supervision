A small opacity within the right lung apex is unchanged. This could reflect an area of confluent consolidation, though also could be residual scarring at that site. Lung volumes are low resulting in bronchovascular crowding with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. However, no other confluent consolidations are identified. No large pleural effusions are identified. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Surgical clips are seen within the right upper quadrant.
