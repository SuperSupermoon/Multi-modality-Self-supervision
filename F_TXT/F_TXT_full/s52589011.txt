Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions, stable on the right, increased on the left, obscures the lungs, particular the lung bases. The right lung may be relatively clear. Consolidation at the base of the left is likely atelectasis. Heart size is difficult to assess, but probably not grossly enlarged. No pneumothorax.
