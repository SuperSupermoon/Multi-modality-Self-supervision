Chronically consolidated left lower lobe has not improved. Mild pulmonary edema has worsened. Progressive consolidation at the base the right lung could be dependent edema but I am more concerned about pneumonia. Mild cardiomegaly unchanged. Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are presumed, and larger today than yesterday. No pneumothorax. ET tube and right PIC line and esophageal drainage tube are in standard placements.
