AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Nasogastric tube and ET tube are in standard placements respectively. Lungs are very low in volume, exaggerating what is clearly pulmonary vascular engorgement. Heart is normal size, and given low lung volumes, mild interstitial edema cannot be excluded, but is probably not present. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
