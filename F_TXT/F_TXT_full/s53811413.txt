A right-sided PICC is in-situ, this terminates in the mid SVC. A tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position compared to the prior study. Lung volumes are unchanged with persistent right basal opacity likely reflecting atelectasis. Left lower lobe atelectasis also noted. No new areas of consolidation seen. No pneumothorax seen. Incidental note is made of an azygos fissure.
