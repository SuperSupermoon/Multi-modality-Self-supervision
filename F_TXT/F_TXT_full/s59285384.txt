ET tube, left subclavian central line and NG tube remain in unchanged satisfactory position. Compared with most recent prior radiograph, there are lower lung volumes and as a consequence, a general increase in lung density. In addition, a new consolidation seen in the left lung base is likely atelectasis. Heart size is unchanged. The mediastinal contours are stable. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. No pneumothorax.
