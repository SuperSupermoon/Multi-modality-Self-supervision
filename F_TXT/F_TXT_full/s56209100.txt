In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, a nasogastric tube remains proximally located with side port above the level of the diaphragm. This could be advanced few cm for standard positioning. Exam is otherwise remarkable for interval progression of bilateral, asymmetrically distributed airspace opacities, most severe in the left mid and lower lung. These findings are most likely due to widespread pneumonia with or without a component of coexisting pulmonary edema. Note is also made of a possible loculated left pleural effusion along the periphery of the left lower hemi thorax, somewhat difficult to assess due to patient rotation.
