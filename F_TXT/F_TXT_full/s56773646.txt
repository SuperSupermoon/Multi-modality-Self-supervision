In comparison with study of ___, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Continued low lung volumes may accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Opacification at the left base most likely reflects a combination of volume loss in the left lower lobe with pleural effusion, though in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. Severe rotary scoliosis convexed to the left is again seen. The left IJ catheter has been removed.
