In comparison with the study of ___, there is a right IJ catheter extending to the mid portion of the SVC a right subclavian PICC line that extends to the cavoatrial junction. Increased opacification at the right base is consistent with pleural fluid and substantial volume loss in the right lower and possibly right middle lobes. Streaks of platelike atelectasis are seen at the left base. No definite vascular congestion.
