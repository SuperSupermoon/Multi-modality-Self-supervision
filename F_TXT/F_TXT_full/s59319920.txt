Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. Atelectasis at the right base is again seen, possibly slightly improved. There is rightward deviation of the trachea, and stable moderate cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. A nasogastric tube is present, ending in the stomach.
