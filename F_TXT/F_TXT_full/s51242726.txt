The lung volumes are high, with potential overinflation. The tip of an endotracheal tube projects 7 cm above the carina. The tube could be advanced by 2-3 cm. Normal course of a nasogastric tube. This tube could also be advanced, given that side hole is at the level of the gastroesophageal junction. There is scarring in both perihilar regions as well as in the right and left upper lobes. A soft tissue density is seen projecting over the left lung apex that should be further clarified on future exams. Moderate atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions. No overt pulmonary edema. No larger pleural effusions.
