In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, heterogeneous opacities throughout the right lung have worsened and are concerning for developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Unilateral distribution of pulmonary edema in the setting of asymmetrical emphysema is considered less likely. If the diagnosis is in doubt clinically, followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful. Exam is otherwise remarkable for slight increase in size of a small right pleural effusion.
