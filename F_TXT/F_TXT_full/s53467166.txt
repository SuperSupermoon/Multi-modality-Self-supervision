New from the recent prior study is ill-defined medial right mid lung airspace opacity which may represent pulmonary vascular congestion, subsegmental atelectasis, or early peribronchial consolidation. There is no right-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Opacification of the left hemi thorax is unchanged from multiple prior studies. A right IJ central venous catheter likely terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Demineralization severe multilevel degenerative changes are noted including spinal fusion hardware in the upper lumbar spine.
