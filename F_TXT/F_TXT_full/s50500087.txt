Again seen is a right IJ sheath overlying the proximal SVC. An NG tube is present the tip likely overlies the gastric fundus. Inspiratory volumes are low. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but unchanged sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted there is engorgement of the central vascular sure, upper zone redistribution, diffuse vascular plethora and vascular blurring, and peribronchial cuffing consistent with CHF and interstitial edema. Again seen is increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Is also patchy opacity at the right lung base similar to the prior film. There is a small to moderate left-sided effusion pleural effusion and a small right pleural effusion. These are essentially unchanged, possibly slightly larger on the right.
