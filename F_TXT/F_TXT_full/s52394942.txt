The patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, stenting within the coronary artery bypass grafts, and placement of a right-sided pacer device with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette is demonstrated. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is demonstrated along with small bilateral pleural effusions. Patchy opacities in both lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis, although infection in the right lung base is not completely excluded. No definite pneumothorax is seen although assessment of the left apex is somewhat obscured by the patient's neck projecting over this region. There is no acute osseous abnormality. Dense vascular calcifications are noted in the upper abdomen.
