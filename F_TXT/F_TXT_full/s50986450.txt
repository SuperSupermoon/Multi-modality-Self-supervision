As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received bilateral pleural drains. The extent of the preexisting pneumothorax has decreased and this decrease is more obvious on the left than on the right. Signs of tension are no longer visible. The diameter of the pneumothorax approximates 5 mm on the left and 10 mm on the right. No other relevant changes.
