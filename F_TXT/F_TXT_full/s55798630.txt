Lung volumes are reduced. Heart size is borderline enlarged. The mediastinal contour is unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Minimal patchy opacities within both lung bases are nonspecific and could reflect infection, aspiration or atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
