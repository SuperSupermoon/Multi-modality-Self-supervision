Lower lung volumes seen on the current exam. Linear right midlung opacity is likely secondary to atelectasis. There is no definite focal consolidation. Moderate cardiac enlargement is again noted. Chronic deformity of the proximal right humerus suggests prior fracture. Rounded structure projecting over left upper quadrant could represent a percutaneous gastrostomy tube.
