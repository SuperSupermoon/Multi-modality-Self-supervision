The exam is limited by patient's rotation. Within limitations, there are persistent streaky opacities in the left mid and lower lung zones, which are stable from the prior chest radiograph and CT. This likely represents chronic atelectasis or scarring. Additionally, there is a linear opacity in the right lower lung zone, which is also stable. No new opacity is identified. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The aorta is tortuous and calcified. The heart size is normal.
