As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Minimal decrease in extent of the left pleural effusion, constant in extent of the right pleural effusion (but the effusion is more medially located). Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette with only minimal signs of fluid overload. No new parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. Unchanged pacemaker and right PICC line.
