Comparison is made with prior study CT, ___. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Small bilateral pleural effusions larger on the right side have minimally increased from prior. Left upper lobe opacity has increased. At this level, the patient had a mass worrisome for malignancy, better seen on prior CTs. Markedly increased opacity in the right lower lobe could be due to atelectasis, a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion and/or aspiration.
