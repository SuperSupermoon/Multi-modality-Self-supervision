A weighted esophageal catheter terminates in the region of the gastroesophageal junction. A right PICC terminates in the mid superior vena cava, which appears retracted compared to prior. Retrocardiac density likely corresponds to known left lower lobe consolidation, better seen on today's CT. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No pulmonary edema is evident on this view. The main pulmonary artery is enlarged, as seen on CT.
