Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates improved aeration as well as persistent postoperative mediastinal widening. There is a persistent small left pleural effusion and associated left basilar atelectasis. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, but the sheath remains in place. An endotracheal tube terminates no less than 5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube terminates in the stomach, although this could be advanced by 2-3 cm to ensure that the side port is also beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
