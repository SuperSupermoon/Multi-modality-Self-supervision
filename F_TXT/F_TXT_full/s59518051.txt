Since the prior exam, there has been development of new moderate pulmonary edema. A retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis. There is no definite pleural effusion, though a small left one cannot be excluded due to obscuration of the left costophrenic angle by the heart. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are normal. The heart is severely enlarged, and unchanged from the prior exam. A left-sided pacemaker is unchanged.
