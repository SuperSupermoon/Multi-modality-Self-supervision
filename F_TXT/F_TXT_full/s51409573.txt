ET tube is unchanged. NG tube tip is off the film, at least in the stomach. There is a moderate cardiomegaly similar compared to prior. Pulmonary vascular re-distribution and alveolar infiltrates are still present but are improved, particularly in the upper lobes compared to prior. The right lower lung and left lower lung alveolar infiltrates are more confluent and underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be totally excluded. There is a small left effusion.
