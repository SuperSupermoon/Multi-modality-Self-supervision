An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip and side ports in the expected location of the stomach. An endotracheal tube is 2.3 cm from the carina. A left subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged with the tip in the upper SVC. The lung volumes are low. An unchanged retrocardiac opacity is consistent with atelectasis. There is no new opacity or pulmonary edema. Mild vascular congestion has improved since the prior exam. There is likely a tiny small left pleural effusion. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
