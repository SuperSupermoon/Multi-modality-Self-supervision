Single AP upright portable views of the chest were obtained. Likely minimal left base atelectasis is seen versus very residual opacity from the previously seen lingular consolidation, decreased in the interval. No new focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
