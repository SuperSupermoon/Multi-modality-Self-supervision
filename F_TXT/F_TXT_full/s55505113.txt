A right-sided PICC line is present, tip over distal SVC. Allowing for lordotic positioning. No pneumothorax is detected. There is moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly, similar to the prior study. There is vascular plethora and vascular blurring, consistent with interstitial edema. Allowing for technical differences, this is not definitely changed. There is worsened retrocardiac density, now with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. The possibility of a small left effusion cannot be excluded. Again seen is patchy opacity at the right base, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation. A small right effusion is also again noted.
