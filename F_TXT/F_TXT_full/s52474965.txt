In comparison with study of ___, with the chest tubes on waterseal, there is no evidence of substantial pneumothorax. The degree of subcutaneous gas on the right has apparently decreased, while it is stable or slightly increased on the left. Opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and there is continued blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
