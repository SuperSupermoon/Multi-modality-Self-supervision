The left lung is relatively well aerated and clear. The right hemithorax is markedly opacified with volume loss, circumferential pleural thickening and pleural fluid with near complete opacification of the right lung with right basal pleural catheter noted. Hydropneumothorax previously seen is not as well evaluated on this not fully upright film. Cardiac contours are somewhat obscured but unremarkable.
