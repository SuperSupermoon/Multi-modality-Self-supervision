Heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous with prominence of the ascending aortic contour. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Nasogastric tube tip is within the stomach. Several clips are noted in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen compatible with prior cholecystectomy. Spiral tacks overlying the midline upper abdomen are compatible prior ventral hernia repair. Unchanged posttraumatic deformity of the left fourth rib is again seen.
