Right-sided chest tube is in place. Subdiaphragmatic air is present, likely related to recent right nephrectomy, but there is no visible pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present as well as minimal bibasilar atelectasis. Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, with tip beyond the field of view of this radiograph.
