Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Predominantly linear areas of opacification are present within both lower lungs, suggestive of atelectasis. No definite areas of consolidation are present to suggest a site of pulmonary infection, but short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard if warranted clinically. Questionable small bilateral pleural effusions but no visible pneumothorax. Tip of feeding tube continues to terminate in the proximal stomach.
