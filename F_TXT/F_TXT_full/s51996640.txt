AP portable supine view of the chest. A left upper extremity access PICC line is seen with its tip projecting over the upper SVC. Opacity projecting over the right mid to lower hemi thorax is secondary to right breast implant. The heart remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contour is unchanged. There is residual retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting a combination of consolidation and effusion. Bony structures are intact.
