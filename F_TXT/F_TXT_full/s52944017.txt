As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube is in unchanged position. The nasogastric tube appears to have been removed. The pre-existing opacity at the left lung base is slightly decreased in extent and severity. The appearance of the right lung base is constant. The lung volumes remain low and the cardiac silhouette is at the upper range of normal. There is slightly increased diameter of the perihilar vascular structures, likely indicative of minimal fluid overload. No evidence of pneumothorax.
