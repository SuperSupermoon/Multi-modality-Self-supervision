Study is limited as the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field-of-view. Left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle is unchanged. Again noted is a left upper lobe paramediastinal mass. Opacification in the left lung base likely reflects a combination of a moderate-to-large pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. The right lung is grossly clear. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
