Compared with the prior film, and allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Again seen is dense retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. The hazy opacity at the left lung base is not appreciated on the current film, question interval resolution. There is new increased density at the right lung base, which could represent a combination of pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or consolidation, not fully characterized on this single view. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. This is probably slightly improved. No pneumothorax is detected.
