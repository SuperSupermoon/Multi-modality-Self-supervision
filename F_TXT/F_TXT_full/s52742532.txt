1. Interval removal of the right internal jugular introducer with placement of a central line having its tip in the mid SVC. There is a stable widening of the cardiac and mediastinal contours in this patient status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, although the aortic contour does appear to be slightly more accentuated on the current study possibly related to differences in positioning. Lungs are grossly clear. There is improving linear opacity in the right mid lung, likely reflecting resolving atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Improving aeration at the left base likely reflecting resolving but some persistent patchy atelectasis. Interval decrease in gaseous distention of the stomach. No large effusions.
