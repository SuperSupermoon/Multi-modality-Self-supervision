A portable frontal upright chest radiograph demonstrates interval repositioning or replacement of the nasogastric tube, which now terminates within the stomach. Lung volumes are slightly lower. Allowing for this, moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema are unchanged. Previously noted bilateral pleural effusions are likely unchanged, although the left costophrenic angle is incompletely imaged and cannot be fully evaluated. Residual contrast is again seen within the colon.
