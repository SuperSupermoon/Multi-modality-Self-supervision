The endotracheal tube is in adequate position at 4 cm above the carina. The right subclavian line has been pulled back slightly but it still crosses the midline and its distal end is in the left mediastinum. The distal end is also pointing downward. As mentioned in the last report this is an unusual orientation for a venous catheter in a patient who does not have a persistent left superior vena cava. The exact location of the catheter cannot be assessed with the exam. The nasogastric tube is well positioned. Worsening of interstitial and alveolar opacities bilaterally, more prominent in the perihilar region, that is mostly compatible with severe pulmonary edema. A superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Does the patient have a limb fracture? If so, a pulmonary embolism cannot be excluded. Tere is no visible pneumothorax.
