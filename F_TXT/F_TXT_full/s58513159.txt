There is a new left PICC which crosses midline points toward the head. It is likely within the upper SVC or right internal jugular vein. The heart size is stably enlarged. There is no significant change in the degree of pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions. There is a retrocardiac opacity which is unchanged and may be related to significant volume loss in the left lower lung. There is no pneumothorax.
