As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina. The guidewire from the left PICC line has been removed. There is minimally increasing extent and severity of the pre-existing right basal opacity, some of which, however, might be exaggerated by overlaying foreign material. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of the left lung. Bilateral skin folds, but no pneumothorax.
