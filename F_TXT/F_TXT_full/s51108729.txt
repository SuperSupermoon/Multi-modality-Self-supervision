Since the recent study of several hr earlier, 2 right-sided chest tubes remain in place, with persistent small to moderate right pleural effusion with apparent loculated basilar pneumothorax at chest tube site. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis has slightly improved in the interval, and a small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
