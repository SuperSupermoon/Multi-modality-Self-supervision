There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube with tip terminating approximately 2.2 cm from the carina. Enteric tube is noted with tip coursing below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach with tip off the inferior borders of the film. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution with crowding of bronchovascular structures, likely related to supine AP positioning and low lung volumes. Patchy opacities in the right mid lung field and right lung base may reflect areas of aspiration and/or atelectasis. No pleural effusion or large pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
