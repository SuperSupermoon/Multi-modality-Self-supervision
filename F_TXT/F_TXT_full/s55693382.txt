In comparison with study of ___, there are continued relatively low lung volumes. Increased opacification in the retrocardiac region with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe with some pleural effusion. There is also opacification at the right base consistent with small effusion and atelectatic changes. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Engorgement of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Dobbhoff tube extends to the lower body of the stomach.
