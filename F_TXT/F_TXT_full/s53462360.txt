AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 3:26 a.m.: Tip of the endotracheal tube is just at the thoracic inlet with the chin flexed, no less than 6 cm from the carina.

Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax. Right lower lobe is now completely collapsed. There may be developing consolidation at the left lung base. Followup recommended for possible pneumonia. At least a small right pleural effusion is presumed. Lucency outlining the left mediastinal contour from the aortic knob to the hilus has been present since chest radiographs ___, presumably represents paraseptal emphysema.
