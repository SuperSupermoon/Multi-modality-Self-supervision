The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but likely unchanged. This includes some increased density surrounding the upper portion of the intrathoracic trachea. There is diffuse increased opacity in both lungs, which appears to represent a combination of alveolar and interstitial opacities. Overall, the appearance is similar to the prior study. The possibility of subtle worsening cannot be entirely excluded. No gross effusion is identified. There is suggestion of diffuse, somewhat patchy sclerosis of the clavicles and humeri, with a tapered appearance of both clavicles. This may represent a more diffuse bony abnormality. The differential includes metabolic changes and/or bony metastases.
