Pleurx catheter remains in place, with persistent moderate-sized loculated right basilar hydropneumothorax. The size of pneumothorax is similar but the amount of pleural fluid has slightly increased. Post-operative changes in right hemithorax are unchanged. Previously noted heterogeneous opacities in the left mid and lower lung region have nearly resolved. Otherwise, no relevant change.
