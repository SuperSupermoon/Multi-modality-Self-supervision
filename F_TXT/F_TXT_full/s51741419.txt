A left-sided pacer unit has a lead terminating in the expected location of the right ventricle. An accessed right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction. Two hepatobiliary stents are present below the diaphragm. A tube of the caliber and consistency of the chest tube projects over the right lower portion of the chest periphery and extends toward the apex. The extent of hydropneumothorax on the right is similar in extent to the most recent prior exam, although it is much improved compared to the exam before that. Otherwise, there is right middle lobe atelectasis. Heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. There is no mediastinal shift or hemidiaphragmatic flattening.
