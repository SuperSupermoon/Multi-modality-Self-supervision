Comparison is made to previous study performed four hours earlier. There has been placement of a nasogastric tube whose tip and side port are below the gastroesophageal junction within the distal body of the stomach. The heart size is within normal limits. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 3.5 cm above the carina. This could be pulled back 1 cm for optimal placement. There is atelectasis at the left lung base. There are no pneumothoraces.
