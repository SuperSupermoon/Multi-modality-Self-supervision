As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Status post sternotomy and sternal wire. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt in situ. Minimal atelectasis at the left lung bases and in the retrocardiac lung areas as well as in the middle lobe. Longstanding relative hyperlucency of the right lung apex could suggest presence of right upper lobe pulmonary emphysema. No evidence of pneumonia. No pleural effusions.
