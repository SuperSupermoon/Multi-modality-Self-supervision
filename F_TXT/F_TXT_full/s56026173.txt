1. Interval removal of the nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube. Lungs are low in volume but without evidence of focal air space consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. Some slight prominence of the perihilar vasculature most likely reflects crowding due to low lung volumes although a fluid-replete state should also be considered. Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are stable.
