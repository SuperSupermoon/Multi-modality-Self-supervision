Left chest tube remains in place, with a persistent small left apical pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube has been replaced by a feeding tube which terminates in the stomach. Worsening opacification in the left mid and lower lung is accompanied by leftward shift of the mediastinum, and likely represents a combination of developing atelectasis and pre-existing consolidation. Within the right lung, there is improving aeration in the right lung base, but persistent small to moderate right pleural effusion. Moderate left effusion is not appreciably changed.
