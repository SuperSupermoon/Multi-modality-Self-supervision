As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new internal jugular vein catheter. The right PICC line has been pulled back and the tip is now projecting over the mid SVC. The double-lumen catheter also projects over the mid SVC. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No pleural effusions. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung bases but no evidence of pneumonia. No pneumothorax or other complications. The tracheostomy tube is constant.
