Heart size is mildly enlarged. Aorta is unfolded with calcifications noted diffusely. The previous pattern of moderate pulmonary edema has improved slightly. Ovoid hazy opacity within the right mid lung field likely reflects fluid within the minor fissure. Small right pleural effusion is also unchanged. The previously noted small left pleural effusion appears decreased in size. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities are detected.
