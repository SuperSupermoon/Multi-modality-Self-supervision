In comparison to earlier same-day chest radiograph, the left IJ central venous catheter has been repositioned. The tip now projects over the expected location of the left brachiocephalic vein, no longer coiled into the left subclavian. Other lines and support devices are stable, including endotracheal tube, enteric catheter, left chest cardiac device with associated leads, and EKG leads overlying the chest. The there are unchanged extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities, right worse than left. There is an unchanged appearance of a likely large right pleural effusion. Difficult to exclude a small left pleural effusion given appearance. No pneumothorax.
