Marked interstitial abnormality with upper lobe predominant nodular opacities are not appreciably changed since the study of 3 days prior. Upper lobe scarring is unchanged, and is likely a sequela of prior TB infection. Slightly increased interstitial prominence is most likely due to pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits despite the projection. Metallic right upper quadrant surgical clips are incidentally noted.
