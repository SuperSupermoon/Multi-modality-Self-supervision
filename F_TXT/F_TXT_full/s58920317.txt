There has been interval repair of the left-sided diaphragmatic rupture. There has been interval re-expansion of the left lung. The left lung is clear. There has appears to be interval increase in opacification of the right lung, likely secondary to pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax. There are no definite pleural effusions. Heart size is normal. ET tube terminates 2.7 cm above the carina. The bilateral chest tubes are in place. There seems to be an NG tube coiled in the upper esophagus. There are opacifications in the left subdiaphragmatic area, likely secondary to drains, however a foreign body cannot be ruled out.
