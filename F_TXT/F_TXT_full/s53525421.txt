There is a cardiac device generator in the left chest wall with leads terminating in the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus. The right ventricular lead appears to loop upon itself. Heart size is mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax or area of consolidation. There is mild blunting of the cardiophrenic angles consistent with small bilateral effusions. Pulmonary vasculature is at the upper limits of normal caliber.
