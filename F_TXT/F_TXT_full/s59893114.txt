Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates stable cardiomediastinal silhouette. A right chest dual lead pacing device is noted, of leads which appear intact and in unchanged position. Relative to most recent examination, opacity within the right lung base appears more confluent. There has been progression of pulmonary vascular congestion. No new confluent consolidation identified on the left. There persists blunting of the right costophrenic angle consistent with a small pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
