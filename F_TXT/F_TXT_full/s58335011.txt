Single portable view of the chest. Moderate mid to lower thoracic dextroscoliosis is noted. There is also apparent fusion of several thoracic vertebral bodies. There is secondary asymmetry of the thoracic cavities. Dense left basilar opacity could represent secondary atelectasis due to the bony changes although underlying effusion or consolidation is also possible. The right lung is grossly clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess. Chronic changes seen in the proximal left humerus presumably from prior fracture.
