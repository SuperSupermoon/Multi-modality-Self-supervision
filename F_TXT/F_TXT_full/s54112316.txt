As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of a right pleural tube, an endotracheal tube, a feeding tube positioned in a remnant esophagus as well as a left pectoral Port-A-Cath. The devices are not changed in position as compared to the previous image. Minimally increased areas of atelectasis at both lung bases. Moderate cardiomegaly that persists. No new parenchymal opacities that would be suggesting infectious changes. The radiograph shows no evidence of pneumothorax or larger pleural effusions.
