Comparison is made with prior study performed two hours earlier. There are low lung volumes. Left apical pneumothorax is barely visible. Pulmonary edema has markedly improved. Bibasilar atelectases have improved, larger on the left side. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Low lung volumes are stable. Left pigtail catheter is in place. Sternal wires are aligned.
