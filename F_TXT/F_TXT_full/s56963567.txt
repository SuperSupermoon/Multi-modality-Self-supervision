AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size and mediastinum are assessed demonstrating cardiomegaly as well as prominence of the azygos vein that might potentially reflect vascular engorgement. There is left lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusion. The findings might reflect atelectasis, but infectious process in this area is a possibility. The right infrahilar opacity is still most likely represent engorgement of the vessels but focus of infection can be present as well. Comparison with prior studies would be beneficial.
