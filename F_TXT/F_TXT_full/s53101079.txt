In comparison with the earlier study of this day, following bronchoscopy there has been substantial clearing of the right upper lobe collapse. In addition, there has been substantial clearing of the combined right middle and lower lobe volume loss. Some residual atelectasis persists in the right hemithorax, with the left hemithorax essentially clear. The monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
