Single portable view of the chest. No prior. Linear opacity identified in the right upper lung laterally suggestive of atelectasis versus scarring. Elsewhere the lungs are clear within the limitation of a significantly rotated exam. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unremarkable. Osseous and soft tissue structures appear normal. There is suggestion of prior healed lateral left rib fractures.
