Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. There is better aeration of the lungs with improved bibasilar atelectasis, improved vascular congestion. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper to mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Right effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. If any, there is a small left effusion.
