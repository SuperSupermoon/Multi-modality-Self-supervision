In comparison to chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there appears to be a left basilar pneumothorax, either enlarged or not appreciated on prior studies due to patient positioning. The side-port of the left-sided chest tube projects over the right lateral ribs and is not likely in the pleural space. Additionally, there are increased right perihilar and retrocardiac consolidations concerning for infectious processes. An ETT tip is 3 cm above the carina. An enteric tube side port projects over the proximal stomach.
