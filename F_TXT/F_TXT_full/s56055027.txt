As compared to ___ radiograph, large left and small right pleural effusions have apparently increased in size, although semi erect positioning may contribute to this apparent change. A new focal right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis, aspiration, and less likely a developing pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
