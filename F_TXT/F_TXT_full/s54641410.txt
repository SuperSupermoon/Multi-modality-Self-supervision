Interval development of left hemi-thorax near complete opacification and leftward shift of mediastinal structures is consistent with near complete left lung collapse. The endotracheal tube remains 7 cm above the carina. Enteric tube appears in similar position. The left chest tube appears well-positioned with its side port in the thoracic cavity. A right layering pleural effusion again noted.
