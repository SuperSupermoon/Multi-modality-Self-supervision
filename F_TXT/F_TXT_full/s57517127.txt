As compared to the previous radiograph, the tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position. The lung volumes remain low. Moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis is not substantially changed. On the right, however, a small pleural effusion might have newly occurred, causing relatively homogeneous and subtle increase in radiodensity at the right lung base. Otherwise, no change is are present. No evidence of pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
