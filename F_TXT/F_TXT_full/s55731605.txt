AP chest compared to ___: Although I see no evidence of pneumothorax, substantial volume of pleural air could be present and not appreciated on this supine view. Right basal pleural tube has been withdrawn, its tip now no longer crosses the midline. Subcutaneous emphysema in the thoracoabdominal wall and neck has decreased. Aside from increase in moderately severe atelectasis at the right base, right lung is clear and there is no appreciable pleural or extrapleural hematoma despite multiple rib fractures, some substantially displaced, progressively so since ___ at 12:46 p.m., particularly the right fifth, sixth and seventh rib fractures. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Left lung is clear.
