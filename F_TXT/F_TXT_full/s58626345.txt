In comparison with the study of ___, the chest tubes remain in place on the right with little if any pneumothorax. Opacification persists at the right base extending along the right lateral chest wall consistent with atelectasis and effusion. Substantial subcutaneous emphysema persists along the right lateral chest wall and upper abdomen, though this appears to be less than on the previous study. Subcutaneous gas is also seen in both supraclavicular regions, more prominent on the left. There is increasing elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour with minimal atelectatic change above it.
