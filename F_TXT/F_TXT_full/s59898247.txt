Lung volumes are low. Apparent mediastinal widening is likely due to patient rotation. There is mild to moderate bibasilar atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions are probable. The cardiac size is stable and there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, without frank pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. Chronic rib and pleural deformities are again noted.
