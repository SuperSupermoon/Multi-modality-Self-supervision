In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. Any residual pneumothorax would be extremely small. The area of suspected increased opacification in the right lung apex cannot be appreciated because of differences in patient's position. The patient has taken a better inspiration. There is still some mild pulmonary congestion. Hazy opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis in this patient with multiple rib fractures on this side.
