In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there may be a tiny residual apical pneumothorax. The right chest tube remains in place and there no appreciable reaccumulation of pleural fluid. Bilateral atelectatic changes are seen at the bases, more prominent on the left. No vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
