A right internal jugular catheter tip projects within the mid SVC. A right basilar Pleurx catheter is in stable position. Since the prior examination, there is increased apparent lucency demonstrated in the left aspect of the aortic knob, that though may be projectional, pneumomediastinum cannot be excluded. There is improvement in bibasilar opacification, likely atelectases. In addition, there is improvement in pulmonary vascular engorgement. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
