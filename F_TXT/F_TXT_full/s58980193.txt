A gastrostomy tube is redemonstrated along the left mid abdomen. Surgical clips are seen in the right upper abdominal quadrant. Dense consolidation at the right lung apex is increased compared to the prior radiograph from ___, but not significantly changed compared to CT from ___. More heterogeneous opacities throughout the left mid-to-lower lung and at the right lung base are markedly increased compared to the prior radiograph from ___, but are also not significantly changed compared to prior CT from ___. Aeration at the left lung apex is preserved. Small bilateral pleural effusions were better seen on recent CT. There is no pneumothorax. The heart size is difficult to assess but was seen to be normal on prior CT.
