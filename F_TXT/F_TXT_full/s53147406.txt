As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased. Nonetheless, there is increasing opacity of the right lung, likely reflecting asymmetric pulmonary edema. The left lung is now unremarkable. Moderate cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta persist. A small pre-existing right pleural effusion is completely unchanged.
