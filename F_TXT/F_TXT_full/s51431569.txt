Comparison is made to prior study from ___. The endotracheal tube tip is appropriately sited, 5 cm above the carina. There is a right IJ and a right subclavian central line with distal lead tips in the mid to distal SVC. There is a left-sided central line with the distal lead tip in the distal SVC. There is a nasogastric tube whose distal tip is off the field of view of the study. There is persistent cardiomegaly. Bilateral pleural effusions are seen. There is atelectasis at the right base and there is a left retrocardiac opacity which are stable. There are no pneumothoraces.
