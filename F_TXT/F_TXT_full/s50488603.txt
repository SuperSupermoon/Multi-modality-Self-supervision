Upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. The thoracic aorta is tortuous. Right infrahilar opacity is noted, which corresponds to atelectasis on CT of the abdomen and pelvis from 4 hours prior. A transesophageal tube is in place, the tip is not visible, but the side port is seen within the stomach.
