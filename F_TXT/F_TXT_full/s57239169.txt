The tip of the right PICC line projects over the mid SVC. A left ventricular assist device is present. The tip of the feeding tube extends below the level of the diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph. There is severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, unchanged. A dense retrocardiac opacity likely represents a combination of atelectasis and a pleural effusion. There is increased right perihilar airspace opacities as well as fluid within the fissure. The combination of findings likely reflects moderate pulmonary edema.
