Patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. There is patchy opacity at the left lung base with new elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, moderate in degree, suggesting coinciding volume loss. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear. There is no definite pleural effusion although it would be difficult to detect a subpulmonic pleural effusion on the left.
