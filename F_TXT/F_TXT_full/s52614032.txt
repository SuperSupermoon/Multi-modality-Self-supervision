Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Dual-lead right-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. Patient is status post median sternotomy. There is mild left base atelectasis. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely relates to overlying soft tissue, although lateral view would be helpful for confirmation. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
