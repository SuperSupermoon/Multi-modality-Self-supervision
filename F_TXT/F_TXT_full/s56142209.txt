AP chest compared to ___: Right PICC line is unchanged in position in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. Heart is still moderately enlarged, and there has been an increase in mediastinal vascular caliber. Lung volumes remain low, and a band of opacity at the base of the right lung barely visible through the liver, is probably atelectasis, though I cannot exclude pneumonia. Because of increased venous caliber in the mediastinum, I would recommend evaluation for possible thrombus, perhaps related to catheter infection. Vascular ultrasound should be diagnostic. Dr. ___ was paged at 9:40 a.m. when the findings were recognized.
