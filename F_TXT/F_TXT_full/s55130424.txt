Lung volumes are low, but I do not see consolidation or severe interstitial abnormality to suggest pneumonia. Heart size is normal. With the chin down, tip of the endotracheal tube less than 2 cm from the carina is not excessively low, but care should be taken that it advanced no further. Esophageal feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Right jugular line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
