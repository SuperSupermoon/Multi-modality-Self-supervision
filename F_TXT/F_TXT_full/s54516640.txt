Since ___ following insertion of a pigtail pleural drainage catheter at the base of the left hemi thorax, the volume of left pleural fluid has decreased, but is probably still substantial and there is probably still considerable left lower lobe atelectasis. Conventional radiographs including lateral and possibly oblique views would be very helpful in assessing the extent of pleural abnormality and the position of the drainage tube which could lie either anterior or posterior to the heart. subsegmental atelectasis at the right base has increased. The heart is normal size. Tracheostomy tube is midline. Right PIC line ends in the low SVC. There is no pneumothorax on either side.
