The lung volumes are low. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The heart is at the upper limits of normal size. There is a similar infrahilar opacification suggesting atelectasis or scarring. More generally there is increased bibasilar opacification, but streaky and band-like in morphology, mostly suggestive of atelectasis or scarring with a suspected small left-sided pleural effusion.
