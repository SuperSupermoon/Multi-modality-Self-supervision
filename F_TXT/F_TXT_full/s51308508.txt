Comparison is made with prior study, ___. There are persistent low lung volumes. Cardiomegaly is obscured by low lung volumes and pleuroparenchymal abnormalities. Right large central catheter tip is in the right atrium as before. The right PICC tip is in the lower SVC/cavoatrial junction. Right lower lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis has improved. Left lower lobe opacities have increased, consistent with worsening atelectasis. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged. ET tube is in standard position, the tip is 4.8 cm above the carina.
