In comparison with study of ___, the right chest tube has been repositioned slightly so that the tip is somewhat lower and overlying the mediastinum and the side hole well placed. Left chest tube is unchanged. There is some increased opacification at the right base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm. This suggests some combination of layering effusion and volume loss in the right lower lobe. There are also atelectatic changes at the left base. The other monitoring and support devices remain in place.
