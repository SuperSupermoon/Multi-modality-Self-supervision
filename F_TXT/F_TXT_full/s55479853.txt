AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The heart size remains unchanged and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. Similar as on the next preceding portable chest examination, there is evidence of bilateral plate atelectasis in supradiaphragmatic position. They have decreased in size. No new infiltrates are seen. The lateral pleural sinuses remain free as before. To exclude or to assess volume of possible pleural effusion, a lateral view would be required to assess posterior pleural sinuses, which can accumulate up to 300 mL without being detectable on frontal view.
