There has been improvement in the collapse of the left lower lobe with improved aeration in the upper lung zones as well as the left pleural effusion. The right lung is overall clear. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. There is no definite pneumomediastinum. A tiny left apical pneumothorax is present. A left upper extremity PICC terminates in the cavoatrial junction. The ETT terminates in the mid trachea in unchanged position. A right pleural pigtail catheter is also unchanged. Included upper abdomen is unremarkable. Spinal hardware is noted.
