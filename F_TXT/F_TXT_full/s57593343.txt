AP chest compared to ___: Small volume of residual left pleural effusion, previously larger, is unchanged since ___. Pulmonary edema and large right pleural effusion seen earlier in this admission have not recurred. There is persistent consolidation at the base of the left lung, but since the hilus is depressed, I think this is more likely atelectasis than pneumonia. No pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Right PICC line ends in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction.
