As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. One left chest tube remains in situ, the two other left chest tubes have been removed. The radiograph shows no evidence of pneumothorax on the left. On the right, there is unchanged evidence of pleural effusions, partly extending into the fissures, and subsequent areas of atelectasis. Unchanged sternotomy wires, unchanged moderate cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.
