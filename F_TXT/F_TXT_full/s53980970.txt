A portable frontal chest radiograph is somewhat difficult to evaluate secondary to blurring of the image, presumably related to patient motion. A tracheostomy terminates in the upper thoracic trachea. The right approach PICC terminates in the mid SVC. The exam is largely unchanged, with somewhat low lung volumes exaggerating the cardiac silhouette and bibasilar atelectasis. No new focal consolidation is identified. There is no appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
