The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. There is bilateral heterogeneous opacification which is again worse on the right than left but substantially improved, probably indicating improvement in background pulmonary edema. However patchy opacities persist and there is volume loss with persistent opacification at the lung bases, greater on the left than right.
