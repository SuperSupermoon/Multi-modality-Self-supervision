Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with similar prominence of the hila bilaterally. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. The lungs are hyperinflated with emphysematous changes again noted. Sutures from prior wedge resection is visualized in the left upper lung field. 4 cm cavitary lesion within the left apex appears relatively unchanged. Residual patchy opacity is seen within the right lung base, which appears improved, however worsening ill-defined opacities are seen within the left mid lung field. Previously seen consolidative opacity in the left lower lobe may be slightly improved in the interval. Small left pleural effusion is likely present. There is no pneumothorax.
