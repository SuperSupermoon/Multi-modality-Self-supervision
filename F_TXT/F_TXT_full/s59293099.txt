A right-sided central venous catheter via a right internal jugular approach terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The heart is normal in size. The lungs are somewhat low volume. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion identified. Subtle opacities seen in the bilateral lung bases could represent atelectasis, aspiration or possible atypical, predominately interstitial infection. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
