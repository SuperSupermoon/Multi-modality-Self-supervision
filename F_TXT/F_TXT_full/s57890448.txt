Per the radiology technologist, patient with lethargy. Best image taken. Single AP semi-upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are overlying wires/tubes. There are relatively low lung volumes. Given the above, no definite focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There may be mild bibasilar atelectasis. There has been interval removal of a right PICC and a Dobbhoff feeding tube.
