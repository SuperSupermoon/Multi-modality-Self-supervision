As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. No evidence of new parenchymal opacities that could be indicative of pneumonia. The lung volumes remain constant. There is constant relatively extensive atelectasis, this at the left lung bases, combined to an area of small pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position.
