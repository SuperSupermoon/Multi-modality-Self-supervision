There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 4.8 cm above the carina. This is appropriately sited. The heart size is within normal limits. Lungs are grossly clear. There is mild coarsening of bronchovascular markings. No pneumothoraces are identified. Nasogastric tube side port is above the GE junction. This could be advanced 10 cm for more optimal placement.
