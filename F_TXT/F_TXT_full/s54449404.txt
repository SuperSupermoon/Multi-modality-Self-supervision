The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. There is no definite pleural effusion, although a relative increase in the degree of diaphragmatic elevation on the right may potentially indicate subpulmonic effusion. Relative hazy increased attenuation of the right lung compared to the left may be an artifact associated with positioning and technique. A calcified granuloma is unchanged at the right lung base.
