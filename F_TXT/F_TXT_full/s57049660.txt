As compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, lungs are clear except for a minimal patchy opacity at the right lung base. Although possibly due to crowding of vascular structures related to low lung volumes, short-term followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude the possibility of an early focus of pneumonia given clinical suspicion.
