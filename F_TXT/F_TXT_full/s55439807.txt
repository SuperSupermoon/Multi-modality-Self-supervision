A dual lead pacemaker/ICD device appears unchanged with leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle, respectively. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear stable. The extreme right costophrenic sulcus is partly excluded, but there is no evidence for pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Streaky opacity in the left lower lung suggests minor atelectasis, probably unchanged. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
