There has been development of a small to moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion. There is atelectasis at the right lung base and superimposed infiltrate would be difficult to exclude. There is a left-sided Port-A-Cath with the distal lead tip in the distal SVC. Heart size is within normal limits. No pneumothoraces are seen. Surgical clips are seen within the right axilla.
