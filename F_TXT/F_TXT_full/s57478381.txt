As compared to the previous image, no relevant change is seen in the postoperative right hemithorax. The dimension of the postoperative pneumothorax is unchanged. Also unchanged are the opacities at the right lung bases, the pleural effusion on the right as well as the postoperative more apical opacities. The rib defects have similar appearance. The air collection in the soft tissues is not substantially changed. Minimally increased is a left retrocardiac atelectasis. Otherwise the left lung continues to be normal.
