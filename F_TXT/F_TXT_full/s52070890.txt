In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 6 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. There is increased opacification at the left base with blunting of the costophrenic angle. There is also retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the hemidiaphragm and opacification laterally. These findings are consistent with pleural effusions and bilateral volume loss in the lower lobes. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Left IJ sheath is in place.
