Single AP view of the chest was obtained for review. A right chest port is noted with tip near the cavoatrial junction. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. There is no pneumothorax. Multiple masses are seen within both lungs, better assessed by concurrent chest CTA.
