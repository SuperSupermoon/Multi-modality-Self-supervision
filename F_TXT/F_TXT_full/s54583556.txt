Portable supine AP view of the chest provided. There has been interval placement of a right IJ central venous catheter with its tip residing in the mid SVC region. The endotracheal tube and orogastric tubes are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The hilar contours appear prominent, which could reflect mild central congestion. Please correlate clinically.
