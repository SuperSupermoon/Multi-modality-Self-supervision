AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained 11 hours earlier during the same day. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position terminating in the trachea 5 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. Unchanged position of a previously described right-sided PICC line as well as NG tube terminating in the fundus of the stomach. The on next previous examination identified central pulmonary edema pattern persists and may even have further increased. Rather typical absence of infiltrates in the periphery close to the chest walls is rather typical for non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Recent echocardiogram of ___ also excluded cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion or pericardial effusion.
