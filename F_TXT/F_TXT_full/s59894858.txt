One portable semi-erect view of the chest. There is a triangular-shaped opacity in the left hemidiaphragm that likely represents either pneumonia or atelectasis. There is also a new heterogeneous opacity in the right lung base that is either atelectasis or pneumonia. The upper lung zones are clear. An NG tube ends in the stomach and its last side port is near the EG junction. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
