AP chest compared to ___: ET tube, right internal jugular line, upper enteric drainage tube in standard placements. Second esophageal device ends midway between the carina and the diaphragm, presumably temperature or pressure probe. Left internal jugular dual-channel catheter ends in the left brachiocephalic vein. Moderate right pleural effusion is layering posteriorly, obscuring detail in the right lower lobe, which could be partially consolidated or focally edematous, but not appreciably changed than the left. Upper lungs are hyperlucent, reflecting emphysema. The heart is normal size.
