Single supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates the lungs are well expanded. There is no pneumothorax. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely represents a residual small pleural effusion, with interval improvement in left basilar atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, with calcifications noted in the aortic knob. Catheter tubing is present over the left upper quadrant, unchanged since the prior study. Coarse interstitial markings are again noted, with no evidence of overt pulmonary edema or focal airspace opacity.
