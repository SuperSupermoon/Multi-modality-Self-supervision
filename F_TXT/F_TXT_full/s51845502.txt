There has been interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter ending in the right atrium. The ET tube and NG tube are in unchanged satisfactory position. No pneumothorax is detected. Lung volumes remain low with unchanged extensive left lung opacity, which obscures the cardiac silhouette. The presence of air bronchograms suggest left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. A small left effusion would be difficult to exclude. Again seen is some patchy opacity at the right cardiophrenic region, though the right lung remains otherwise grossly clear.
