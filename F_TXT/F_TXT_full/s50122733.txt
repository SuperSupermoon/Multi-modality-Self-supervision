In comparison with the study ___ ___, there is an placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the distal ID or antrum of the stomach. The right hemidiaphragm is obscured and there is hazy opacification at the base, consistent with pleural effusion and atelectatic changes. This appearance somewhat obscures the patchy area of opacification at the right base seen on the prior study, which could represent developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Less prominent changes are seen on the left. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size and there is mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could represent some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
