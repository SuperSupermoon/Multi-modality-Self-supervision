The patient is rotated. Lung volumes decreased in the interim with bronchovascular crowding. Otherwise, no significant interval change. Persistent cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe with associated right upper lobe collapse and elevation of the minor fissure. No evidence of pneumothorax. Interval increased right lower lung opacity may reflect interval aspiration. No pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is overall unchanged.
