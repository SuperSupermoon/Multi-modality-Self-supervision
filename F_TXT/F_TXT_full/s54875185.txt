Compared to the only preceding chest radiographs, ___. Cardiac silhouette is moderately to severely enlarged due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened, but mediastinal veins are not dilated and there is no pulmonary edema. Small right pleural effusion is likely. No pneumothorax. Although no acute fracture or other chest wall lesion is seen, conventional chest radiographs are not sufficient for detection or characterization of most such abnormalities. If the demonstration of trauma to the chest wall is clinically warranted, the location of any referrable focal findings should be clearly marked and imaged with either bone detail radiographs or Chest CT scanning.
