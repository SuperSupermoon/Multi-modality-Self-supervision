There is near complete opacification of the left hemithorax likely reflective of a combination of large pleural effusion and atelectasis. Heart size cannot be assessed due to the presence of the left hemithorax opacification. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta are present. No pulmonary vascular congestion is seen. The right lung is grossly clear. No pneumothorax is noted. No acute osseous abnormalities are visualized.
