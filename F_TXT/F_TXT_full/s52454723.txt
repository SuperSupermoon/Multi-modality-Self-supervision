There has been interval placement of a nasogastric tube which appears to course below the diaphragm with the tip out of view of this film, however with the sideport in the body of the stomach. The lungs are mildly hyperinflated. Streaky left basilar opacity is unchanged compared to the prior exam and likely secondary to atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic arch. Lower thoracic upper lumbar vertebral hardware is unchanged in position.
