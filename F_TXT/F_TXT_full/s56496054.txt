AP chest compared to ___: Right lung base is partially obscured, probably by small right pleural effusion, but the appearance still raises concern for several small regions of pneumonia. When feasible, a lateral chest radiograph would be helpful to determine the contribution of each. Thoracic aorta is very large generally and tortuous. Cardiomegaly is moderate. Mediastinal veins and pulmonary circulation in the right lung are engorged, indicating biventricular cardiac decompensation. No pneumothorax.
