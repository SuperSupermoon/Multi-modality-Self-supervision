ET tube tip lies 3.8 cm above the carina. NG tube tip and side-port extend beneath the diaphragm and overlie the stomach. Additional lines overlie the upper abdomen, not fully characterized. Left IJ central line tip overlies the mid SVC. No pneumothorax detected. Compared with the prior film, the ET and NG tubes are new and the previous large lucency in the upper abdomen has been decompressed. Lungs are more expanded. However, there is opacity at both lung bases suggestive of bilateral effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF.
