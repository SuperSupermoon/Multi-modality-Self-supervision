Battery pack seen in overlying the left lung base, with lead extending superiorly apparently represents a left-sided vagus nerve stimulator, based on prior chest x-ray report. A Port-A-Cath type right subclavian central line is present, tip over proximal most SVC. Its tip appears to lie slightly more proximal 1 on the prior film. No pneumothorax is detected. Heart size is prominent, but not frankly enlarged. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF, similar to prior. Allowing for obscuration of the left lung base, no focal infiltrate or gross effusion is identified.
