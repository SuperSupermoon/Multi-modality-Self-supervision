Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is accompanied by upper zone vascular redistribution, vascular indistinctness and mild interstitial edema. A slightly more confluent opacity at the right lung base medially may reflect asymmetrical dependent edema, but followup radiographs may be helpful to exclude a developing infection in this region. Small bilateral pleural effusions have improved since previous study. Calcified right hilar lymph nodes are unchanged.
