ET tube is too low touching the carina. It should be pulled back at least 2.5 cm. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Increased density in lower lung could be due to increased layering pleural effusion and slightly increase in atelectasis, mostly in left lower lung. There is no pneumothorax. Right jugular line has been removed. Left jugular line ends at the junction of superior vena cava in brachiocephalic vein. NG tube is in the stomach. Prior sternotomy was done for CABG.
