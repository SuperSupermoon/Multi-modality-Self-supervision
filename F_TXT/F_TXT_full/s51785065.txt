The trauma board somewhat obscures fine detail at the bases. Within the limitations, there is no focal consolidation. There is mild pulmonary edema. There are also emphysematous changes. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Allowing for positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. No fracture is identified on this limited supine view.
