Left subclavian PICC line is unchanged, with tip near distal SVC/RA junction. Slight interval improvement in the retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Minimal atelectasis the right base. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is fracture of the mid right clavicle. Previously seen cervical spine fixation hardware is not included on this film. Balloon overlying left upper quadrant consistent with GI tract tube noted.
