Since the prior study there has been progression of hilar enlargement and perihilar edema. Left lower lobe opacity appears to be more conspicuous most likely as part of the edema process. ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carinal. Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC. NG tube tip is not clearly seen on current examination, most likely in the stomach. No pneumothorax.
