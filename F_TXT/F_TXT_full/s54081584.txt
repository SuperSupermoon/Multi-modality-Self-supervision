Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient is rotated to the right. There are low lung volumes. There is prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature. There is also blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggesting a small right pleural effusion. Right base opacity is seen which may be due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation is not excluded. Additionally, left base opacity may be due to atelectasis, infection or aspiration. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged, likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Partially imaged is cervical spine hardware.
