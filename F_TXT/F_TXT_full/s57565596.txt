An endotracheal tube remains in place with its tip located at least 5.8 cm from the level of the carina. A Dobbhoff tube tip is positioned over the stomach. A right IJ central venous catheter tip is located in the lower SVC. A hemodialysis catheter tip is located within the right atrium. Linear atelectasis in the left lung base is little changed. Decreased lung volumes accentuate the pulmonary vasculature. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size, the mediastinal contours are normal, and pleural surfaces appear normal.
