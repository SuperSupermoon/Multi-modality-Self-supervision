AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained. Lung volumes are low and the patient is rotated to the right, which limits the evaluation. There is bibasilar atelectasis with probable small bilateral pleural effusions. The heart appears enlarged, though this could be in part magnified due to technique. Possibility of pneumonia at the lung bases cannot be excluded, though atelectasis is favored. No pneumothorax is seen. Mediastinal contour is difficult to assess. No bony abnormalities.
