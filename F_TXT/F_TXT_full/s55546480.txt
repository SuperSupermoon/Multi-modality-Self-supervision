Comparison is made with the prior study ___. Lines and tubes are in standard position. There are persistent low lung volumes. Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities, larger on the left side, are unchanged, consistent with atelectasis. The upper lungs are grossly clear. There are no new lung abnormalities, pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions.
