No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and there is prominence of engorged pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. No definite consolidation, though this could be hidden especially in the retrocardiac region. A curious curvilinear opacification is seen projecting over the lower portion of the medial right clavicle. It is probably of little clinical significance, though the etiology is unclear.
