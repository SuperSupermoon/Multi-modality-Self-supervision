Compared with the prior study, there is no significant change. There is persistent mild left lower lobe and lingular atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion. No new focal consolidation, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The tip of the access right-sided Port-A-Cath is not well visualized, as it overlaps with the spinal hardware.
