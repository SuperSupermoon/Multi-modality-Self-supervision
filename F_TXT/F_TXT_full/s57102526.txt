Interval decreased distention of neoesophagus with indwelling nasogastric tube in place. Moderate right pleural effusion and adjacent right basilar lung opacification is similar. Diaphragmatic herniation on the left is again demonstrated with distended loops of bowel which are not fully evaluated on this portable chest radiograph. Adjacent small left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis have apparently slightly worsened.
