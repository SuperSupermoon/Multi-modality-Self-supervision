Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs are well expanded. Left basal opacity has progressed and could reflect a focus of aspiration or pneumonia. Additional focal opacities in the lateral right mid lung and medial right lower lung could reflect additional sites of infection or aspiration. Interstitial prominence is greater than on the prior and a component of pulmonary edema superimposed upon existing chronic lung disease is suspected. No pneumothorax is seen with perhaps trace bilateral pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
