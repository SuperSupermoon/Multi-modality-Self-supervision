Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is detected. Moderate to large layering right pleural effusion is re- demonstrated. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged with rightward shift of mediastinal structures again noted. Lung volumes are low which causes crowding of the bronchovascular structures and streaky atelectasis in the left lung base. Right basilar opacification may reflect compressive atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
