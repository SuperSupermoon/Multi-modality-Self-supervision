A portable upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a tracheostomy catheter in unchanged position. The aortic stent graft is unchanged also. The lung volumes are low and there is a stable small left pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly and retrocardiac atelectasis is stable. There is a faint linear opacity over the patient's left upper chest, which may represent the PICC, but it could be overlapping of underlying structures. There is no pneumothorax. Persistent widening of the mediastinum and cardiac silhouettes.
