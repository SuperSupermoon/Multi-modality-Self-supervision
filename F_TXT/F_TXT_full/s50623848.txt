In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a left subclavian PICC line that extends to the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. Lower lung volumes may account for much of the increased prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. There is also increased fullness of the pulmonary vessels. This could also reflect the low lung volumes, though some element of pulmonary vascular congestion is probably present.
