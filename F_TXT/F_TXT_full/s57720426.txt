Patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery. Indwelling support and monitoring devices are remarkable for an intra-aortic balloon pump terminating about 5.2 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. This could be advanced a few centimeters for standard positioning. Other devices remain in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Asymmetrically distributed right-sided airspace opacities have slightly improved and may reflect asymmetrical edema or an improving pneumonia. Left lower lobe atelectasis has nearly resolved. No pneumothorax.
