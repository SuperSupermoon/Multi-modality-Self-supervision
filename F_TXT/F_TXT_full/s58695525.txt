An endotracheal tube terminates in the upper trachea about 6.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach. Its sidehole marker projects over the expected site of the gastroesophageal junction. The lungs appear clear. There no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
