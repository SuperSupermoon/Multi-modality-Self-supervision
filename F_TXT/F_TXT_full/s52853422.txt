Again seen is a right IJ catheter with tip overlying the right atrium. As before, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged. Compared with the prior study, there is much more pronounced hazy confluent opacity in both lungs, consistent with alveolar opacities, with air bronchograms noted. There is new obscuration of the right and left costophrenic angles consistent with right-greater-than-left layering pleural effusions. There is probable underlying bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation.
