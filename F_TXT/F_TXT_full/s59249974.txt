AP portable upright view of the chest. Overlying EKG leads present. Lung volumes are low limiting assessment. Suture material projecting over the right upper and left lateral mid lung reflect prior sites of resection. Bronchovascular crowding at the lung bases limits assessment though allowing for this, no convincing evidence for pneumonia or edema. No pneumothorax is seen. Overall cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. Bony structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
