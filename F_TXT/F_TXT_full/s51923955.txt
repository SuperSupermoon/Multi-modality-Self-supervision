Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Since the prior study, there is slightly less nodular appearance of the consolidations and more diffuse widespread picture is seen, although still some nodular opacities can be demonstrated. Again as previously mentioned, the etiology might be septic emboli versus pulmonary edema or less likely multifocal pneumonia. Extensive hemorrhage into the lungs is a possibility. Fat emboli would be less likely. Correlation with chest CT is strongly recommended.
