Since ___, the base of the aerated right lung has elevated, changed configuration obscuring much of the right heart border. Even thought the mediastinum is midline the findings are best explained by collapse of the right middle and lower lobes. A left retrocardiac opacity obscures the margin of the descending thoracic aorta and the medial diaphragmatic interface, most likely due to atelectasis of the basal segments of the left lower lobe. Bilateral small pleural effusions are possible. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar structures are normal.
