AP portable supine view of the chest. Underlying trauma board limits the assessment. Multiple right rib fractures are again noted. Lung volumes are low which limits the assessment. No supine evidence for pneumothorax. Please note, a small right pneumothorax was seen on the same day chest CT. No large effusion is seen. Scattered opacities in the lungs likely represent atelectasis. Heart size is difficult to assess.
