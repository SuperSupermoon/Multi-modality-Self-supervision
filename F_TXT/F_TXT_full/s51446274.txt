A single frontal portable chest radiograph demonstrates an enteric catheter terminating within the body of the stomach. The sideport is just beyond the GE junction and could be advanced several centimeters. Accounting for differences in position, bilateral pleural effusions are slightly decreased compared to prior examination. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. No pneumothorax.
