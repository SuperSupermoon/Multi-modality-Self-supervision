As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a left-sided chest tube. The chest tube is directed towards the medial portions of the mediastinum and currently projects over the aortic knob. The left lung is now well-expanded, no pneumothorax is seen on the left. Atelectasis of the left lower lobe, however, persists. The pre-existing right upper lobe atelectasis is resolved. The heart continues to be borderline in size. The other monitoring and support devices are constant in appearance.
