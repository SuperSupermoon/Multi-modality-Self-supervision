A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left chest wall pacer device with leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle, unchanged in position. Heart size remains enlarged, unchanged. There is improvement of diffuse bilateral opacities, suggestive of improved mild pulmonary edema. More focal opacity in the lower right lung is likely atelectasis. Bilateral pleural effusions are persistent, increased on the right and unchanged on the left. There is no pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
