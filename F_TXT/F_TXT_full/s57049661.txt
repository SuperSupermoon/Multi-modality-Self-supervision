A nasogastric tube is in-situ, the tip is in the left upper quadrant. A right internal jugular catheter is in-situ, the tip is in the distal SVC. Lung volumes remain low, unchanged compared to the prior study. Left basilar atelectasis versus consolidation is also unchanged. Between the projection and the low lung volumes, it is difficult to evaluate the heart size however it is grossly unchanged compared to the prior study. Probable small left pleural effusion.
