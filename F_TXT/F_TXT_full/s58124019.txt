1. Interval removal of the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. There are layering small-to-moderate bilateral effusions. There is a persistent airspace opacity involving the right mid and lower lung and the left lower lung which could reflect pulmonary contusions, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered given the lack of the majority of these opacities on the patient's initial trauma CT performed on ___. Bilateral rib fractures are better seen on the recent CT study. Heart remains stably enlarged. Overall mediastinal contours are stable given patient rotation on the current examination. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
