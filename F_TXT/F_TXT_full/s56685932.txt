Left lower lobe atelectasis is still severe but somewhat improved. There has also been a little clearing in the left upper lobe component of bilateral consolidative abnormality. Since this is accompanied by continued decrease in bilateral pleural effusions I suspect the process is substantially pulmonary edema. Moderate cardiomegaly is still present. No pneumothorax. Lines and tubes are unchanged from before. .
