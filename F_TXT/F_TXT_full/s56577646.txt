Single AP upright portable view of the chest is obtained. The lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Bi-apical pleural thickening is again seen. Mild left basilar atelectasis/scarring is seen. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Stable lateral right upper lung scarring is again seen.
