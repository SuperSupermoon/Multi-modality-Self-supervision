Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.3 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses through the stomach with side port in the stomach, and tip off the inferior borders of the film. Right sided central venous catheter tip terminates in the proximal right atrium. Heart size is normal. The aorta is diffusely calcified. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise within normal limits. Lungs are hyperinflated with severe upper lobe predominant emphysematous changes, more pronounced in the right lung than on the left. 12 mm nodular opacity projecting over the right mid lung field is present. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
