Lung volumes are slightly low leading to crowding of the pulmonary bronchovascular structures. The heart is not enlarged. The cardiomediastinal contour is otherwise within normal limits. A right-sided PICC is in-situ, the tip is in the mid to distal SVC. No consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen. The visualized bony structures are unremarkable in appearance.
