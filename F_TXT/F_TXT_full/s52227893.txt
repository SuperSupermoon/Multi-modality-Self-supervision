ET tube tip is relatively low, 2 cm above the carina and should be pulled back. NG tube is coiled within the stomach. Bibasal consolidations are present, might potentially represent atelectasis due to low lung volumes but infectious process is a possibility. Small bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present as well.
