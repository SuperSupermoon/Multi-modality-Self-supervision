There is new substantial opacification at both lung bases, probably a combination of moderate pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. Pulmonary vasculature is now engorged, but I do not believe there is pulmonary edema. Mild to moderate enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable except for slight interval decrease in mediastinal venous engorgement. Tracheostomy tube midline. Right subclavian catheter tip in the region of the superior cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
