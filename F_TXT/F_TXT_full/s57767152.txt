Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.9 cm from the carina. Lung volumes are low compared to the prior study. This accentuates the cardiomediastinal silhouette size which appears borderline enlarged. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present without overt pulmonary edema. Hazy and patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. No acute osseous abnormality is seen. Clips are seen within the neck bilaterally compatible with recent thyroidectomy.
