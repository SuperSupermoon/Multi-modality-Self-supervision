Single portable chest radiograph was provided. An endotracheal tube terminates in the trachea approximately 3.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube can only be followed to the lower esophagus and the tip is not clearly visualized. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate pulmonary edema is stable. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely due to low lung volumes and rotation of the patient. A monitoring device overlies the patient and obscures evaluation of the lungs.
