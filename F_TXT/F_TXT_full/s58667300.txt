A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. There is retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the left hemidaphragm, which could reflect a combination of left lower lobe volume loss and sequela of aspiration, including aspiration pneumonia. There may be a trace left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
