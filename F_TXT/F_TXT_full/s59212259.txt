Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study from ___. The ET tube tip is 6.8 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is most likely in the stomach. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. The Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the left pulmonary artery. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal consolidations are unchanged. Vascular engorgement is noted, but no overt pulmonary edema can be currently assessed. Infectious process may be obscured by pleural effusions.
