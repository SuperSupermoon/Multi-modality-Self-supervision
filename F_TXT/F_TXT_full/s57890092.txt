Lung volumes are decreased compared to the prior exam. Heart size remains within normal limits. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. Within the right upper lobe and perihilar region, there is chronic opacification compatible with radiation fibrosis. Mild pulmonary edema is demonstrated with perhaps slight enlargement of a moderate size right pleural effusion which is partially loculated superiorly and medially. Right basilar opacification may reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen.
