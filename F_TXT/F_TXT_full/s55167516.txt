Since the prior exam performed after the earlier thoracentesis, there appears to have been a slight increase in the residual left pleural effusion. It remains small in size. Again, some left basilar atelectasis persists. There are persistent fibrotic changes at the bases. No pneumothorax is identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
