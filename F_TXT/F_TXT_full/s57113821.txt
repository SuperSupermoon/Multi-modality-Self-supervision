New ET tube in standard position. Nasogastric tube is coiled in the stomach. Compared to ___ the mediastinal vascular caliber has decreased and there has been a slight improvement in pulmonary edema in the left lung. These findings may be due to the physiologic effects of positive pressure ventilation rather than hemodynamic improvement. Consolidation in the suprahilar right lung has not improved and may be due anemia. Bibasilar atelectasis is considerable, and moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
