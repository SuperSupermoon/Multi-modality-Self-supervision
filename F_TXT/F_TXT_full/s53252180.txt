An ET tube is present. The carina is not well delineated. Allowing for this, the ETT probably lies approximately 3.9 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off the film. A right subclavian PICC line is present, tip near SVC/RA junction. A tiny (3mm) metallic density is again noted in the left upper quadrant, ? foreign body. The cardiac silhouette is obscured due to surrounding effusion/opacification. I suspect it is grossly changed. There appear to be large bilateral layering effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Mild vascular plethora noted. Compared with ___ at 5:07 a.m., the overall appearance is similar. The right effusion may be slightly more pronounced.
