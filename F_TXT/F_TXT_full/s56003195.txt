The right pigtail catheter is again seen overlying the right hemi thorax laterally in the mid zone. No obvious right-sided pneumothorax is detected, though a tiny occult pneumothorax cannot be entirely excluded. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Prominence of the right hilum and faint hazy opacity in the right mid lung laterally are similar to the prior film.
