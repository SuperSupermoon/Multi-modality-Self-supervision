Tip of Swan-Ganz catheter projects in left retrocardiac region within the expected distal segmental branch of the left lower lobe pulmonary artery. Dr. ___ has been notified of this finding by telephone at 8:15 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery. Tip of the endotracheal tube is in standard position terminating about 5 cm above the carina. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and accompanied by pulmonary vascular engorgement and asymmetrical perihilar edema, worse on the right than the left. A more confluent opacity in the right lower lobe could reflect dependent pulmonary edema or a secondary process such as infection. Moderate layering right pleural effusion is also noted. Finally, widening of the mediastinum is present above the level of the aortic arch. Although possibly due to venous distention in the setting of congestive heart failure, the possibility of lymphadenopathy or mass is not excluded in the absence of older radiographs for comparison. With this in mind, careful followup radiographs are recommended following appropriate treatment for congestive heart failure prior to discharge. This finding was also communicated to Dr. ___ at the time of the above communication.
