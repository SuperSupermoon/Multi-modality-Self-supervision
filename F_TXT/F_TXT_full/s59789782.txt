Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. The diaphragms are obscured which may be due to overlying soft tissue and underpenetration. However, small pleural effusions are very difficult to exclude. The thorax is underpenetrated due to body habitus. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is again seen peripheral subpleural increased interstitial pattern as previously seen to be consistent with UIP. There may be superimposed pulmonary edema on the current study or active component of fibrosis. There are increased bibasilar opacities which may in part related to the underpenetration, although an infectious process is difficult to exclude.
