Left costophrenic angle is not fully included on this exam, however, a small left pleural effusion is likely. Retrocardiac consolidation likely reflects atelectasis. Mild perihilar vascular congestion is noted. Right lung is clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is normal.
