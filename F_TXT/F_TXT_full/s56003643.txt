Single AP upright image of the chest was obtained. There is a suggestion of cephalization possibly due to mild congestion or partially supine positioning. A focal round density in the right mid hemithorax likely represents a calcified granuloma. There is bibasilar atelectasis, however, there is no focal consolidation in the upper lung fields. The cardiac sihouette is mildly enlarged which also may be due to patient positioning. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There are no bony abnormalities. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
