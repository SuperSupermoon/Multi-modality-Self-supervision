Evaluation is somewhat limited by underlying trauma board. A right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the upper to mid SVC. Markedly enlarged mediastinum is due to calcified lymph nodes as seen on outside chest CT. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Lung volumes are decreased and there is atelectasis at the left lung base. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No acute osseous injury identified.
