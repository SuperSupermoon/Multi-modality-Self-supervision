Left-sided AICD device is noted with single lead terminating in the right ventricle, unchanged. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is again noted, accentuated by the presence of low lung volumes. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution. Opacification within the left lung base may reflect atelectasis but infection is not excluded. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. There is no pneumothorax. Surgical anchor is seen projecting within the left humeral head.
