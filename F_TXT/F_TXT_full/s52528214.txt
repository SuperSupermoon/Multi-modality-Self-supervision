Some of the apparent improvement in severe multi focal consolidation over the past 2 days is due to decreasing moderate right pleural effusion, the rest is due to genuine clearing of the consolidation, that still persists throughout the right lung and on the left at the apex. Borderline cardiomegaly is stable. Left pleural effusion is presumed, but not large. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube and esophageal drainage tube are in standard placements.
