As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly decreased. There is a massive increase in size, number and radiodensity of the pre-existing multifocal and diffusely distributed ill-defined parenchymal opacities. The predominant pattern of these opacities is nodular on the current radiograph. Rapidly progressive infection is the first differential diagnostic consideration. Moderate cardiomegaly. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
