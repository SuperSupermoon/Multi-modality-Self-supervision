Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 2.7 cm from the carina. Orogastric tube tip can only be traced to the level of the distal esophagus, and likely should be advanced. The patient is status post median sternotomy. Low lung volumes are present which accentuates the size of the heart which is likely mildly enlarged. Aortic knob is distinct. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted, but no overt pulmonary edema is seen. Bibasilar patchy airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis though aspiration or infection is not excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
