Compared to the prior study, bibasilar infrahilar patchy opacities are again seen, with an additional area of platelike atelectasis at the left base. There has probably been slight improvement at the left lung base. Otherwise, no significant interval change. Suggestion of slight prominence of both pulmonary arteries is similar to the prior study. Doubt significant CHF. No gross effusion.
