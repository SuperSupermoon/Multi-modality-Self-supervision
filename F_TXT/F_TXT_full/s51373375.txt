Single AP chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of an enteric tube, which appears to traverse the thorax along the expected course of the esophagus. Its terminal tip appears to project within the stomach in appropriate position. An endotracheal tube is identified, in appropriate position 5.2 cm from the carina. There has been little interval change when compared to prior examination obtained 2 hr previously. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Several left-sided rib fractures are noted with no pneumothorax identified. No focal consolidation convincing for pneumonia is identified. Elevation of the right minor fissure reflect right upper lobe atelectasis. A right paratracheal hilar calcification is thought to possibly reflect a calcified node.
