Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits and unchanged since ___ radiograph. Low lung volumes accentuate the bronchovascular structures. Allowing for this factor, lungs are grossly clear, and there is no definite pleural effusion. Minimal blunting of lateral left costophrenic sulcus is unchanged and suggestive of pleural thickening. Post vertebroplasty changes are noted in the upper lumbar spine at a site of prior compression fracture.
