A single frontal AP view of the chest shows new hazy opacification at the right base. In comparison to the prior exam, the lung volumes are lower. This may be accentuating the lung markings in the right base, and related to atelectasis, although in the proper clinical setting, a pneumonia cannot be excluded. The low lung volumes are also accentuating the heart size, which is moderately enlarged, and seems to be slightly larger than in the prior exam. There is no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. Surgical material is seen at the gastroesophageal junction, and unchanged from the prior exam.
