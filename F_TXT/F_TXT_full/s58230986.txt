Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No evidence of right lower lobe collapse seen in the current study. Upon further review of the scout radiograph from cervical spine CT, the opacity projecting over the right lower hemithorax likely represents the patient's overlying hand.
