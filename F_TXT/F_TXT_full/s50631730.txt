Compared to chest radiographs ___. Left lung is clear. Small nodular opacity projects over the anterior aspect right fourth rib. This could be the margin of the small region of atelectasis or pneumonia. If possible I would repeat frontal chest radiographs, in the radiology Department if possible, at full inspiration to see if it persists before assuming that it is clinically significant. Small right pleural effusion may be present. Heart size top-normal. No pneumothorax.
