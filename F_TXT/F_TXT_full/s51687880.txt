The ET tube tip lies approximately 4.2 cm above the carina. An NG type tube is present, tip overlying gastric fundus. The sideport lies in the region of the GE junction. They right ___-Ganz catheter tip overlies the main pulmonary artery. A left IJ central line tip lies in the region of the distal SVC/RA junction. Again seen is an ECMO catheter, similar in position. Multiple surgical clips overlie the upper right chest wall and surrounding soft tissues. Again seen is marked widening of the mediastinum, similar to the prior study. Also again seen is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Also again seen is a right pleural effusion, slightly larger, with fluid now seen in the minor fissure and with fluid/pleural thickening again seen along the right chest wall. There is underlying bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation. Hazy density in the right lung could represent some degree of layering pleural fluid. There is upper zone wrist there is mild upper zone redistribution decreased compared with earlier the same day.
