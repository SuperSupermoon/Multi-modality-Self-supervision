Orogastric tube now courses below the diaphragm and terminates in the gastric fundus. Endotracheal tube terminates 4.1 cm above the carina. A partially visualized central venous line terminates in the right atrium. Diffuse bilateral patchy opacities are again seen. Opacification of the left costophrenic angle could relate to small amount of pleural fluid. Lung volumes are decreased.
