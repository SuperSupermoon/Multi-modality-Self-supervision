As compared to ___, the patient has been extubated. Left bronchial stents remain in place. And note is again made of a large left hilar mass as well as extensive consolidation and atelectasis in the left lower lobe, slightly better aerated with improved visualization of descending thoracic aortic interface. Focal medial opacity at right lung base has also improved. Moderate left pleural effusion and probable small right pleural effusion are unchanged.
