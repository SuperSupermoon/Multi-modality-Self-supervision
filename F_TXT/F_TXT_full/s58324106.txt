There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter which terminates at the brachiocephalic/SVC junction without evidence of pneumothorax. The patient is status post median sternotomy. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal. 8 mm nodular opacity projecting over the right upper lung appears calcified and may represent a calcified granuloma. This can be confirmed on nonurgent chest CT. Lateral left base scarring is again seen.
