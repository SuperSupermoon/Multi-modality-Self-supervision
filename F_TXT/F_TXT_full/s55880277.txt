Right apical pneumothorax is unchanged in size. A right chest tube is in stable position though with increased adjacent atelectasis, which could suggest a fissural location. There is no residual right basilar pneumothorax. On the left, there is a small effusion, as well as a small persistent left apical and medial pneumothorax. As contralaterally, no significant basal component is appreciated. There is no new opacity to suggest pneumonia. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, with no new pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. Median sternotomy wires are in unchanged position.
