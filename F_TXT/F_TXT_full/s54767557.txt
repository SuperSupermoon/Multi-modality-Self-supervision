Portable AP semi-erect view of the chest was reviewed and compared to the prior study. An endotracheal tube ends 8-9 cm above the carina and if advanced 2-3 cm would be in the proper location. An upper enteric tube passes into the stomach and off of the radiograph. A right internal jugular venous introduction sheath is visualized. Right lower lung opacity represents platelike atelectasis. Low lung volumes and a possible tiny left pleural effusion are unchanged. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are clearer on today's study.
