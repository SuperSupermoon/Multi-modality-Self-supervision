The patient is more appropriately positioned in this examination. The wire from the newly placed right PICC has been removed and the tip can be seen just beyond the origin of the SVC. A right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter sheath is still in place, but the Swan-Ganz catheter itself has been removed. Otherwise, there are stable low lung volumes, bilateral pleural effusions, and bibasilar atelectasis. There is stable widening of the mediastinum and cardiac silhouette. There is no pneumothorax. Intact sternal cerclage wires can be seen.
