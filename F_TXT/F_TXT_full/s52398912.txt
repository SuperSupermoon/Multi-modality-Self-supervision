CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. A PICC line is present. The tip could be partially obscured by an electronic lead device (likely spinal stimulater). However, the tip probably overlies the distal SVC. It may extend to the region of the SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax is detected. No CHF, focal consolidation, or gross effusion is identified. The right hemidiaphragm is elevated or eventrated.
