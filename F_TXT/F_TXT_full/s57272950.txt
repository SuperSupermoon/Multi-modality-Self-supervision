A tracheostomy tube is in place. The patient is rotated. A small layering left pleural effusion with associated left basilar subsegmental atelectasis is not appreciably changed. There are no new focal consolidations in either lung. The heart and mediastinum cannot be accurately assessed due to projectional and rotational limitations, but contours are stable. There is no pneumothorax. There is stable marked S-shape scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine.
