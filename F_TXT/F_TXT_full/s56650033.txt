Single portable chest radiograph is limited by obliqued patient position. Within this limitation, the cardiomediastinal contours are unremarkable. Increased density projecting over the right hilus likely reflects a pulmonary vessel, though this could be further evaluated with properly positioned frontal and lateral chest radiographs. Save minimal atelectatic changes in the lung bases, lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
