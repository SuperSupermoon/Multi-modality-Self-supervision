Heart size is moderately to severely enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. The pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Interstitial opacities in the lung bases may either reflect atelectasis and/or chronic changes. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There appears to be subluxation of the glenohumeral joints bilaterally with degenerative changes which appear chronic.
