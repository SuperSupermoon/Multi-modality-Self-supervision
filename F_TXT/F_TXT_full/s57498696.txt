The degree of opacification of the right lung has increased, particularly in mid upper parts of the colon. In the left mid lung, there is also new patchy opacity, somewhat rounded; development of a new area of malignant involvement is not excluded. Although the degree of pleural effusion, if any, on the right is difficult to assess, a component of pleural effusion is likely with atelectasis, but no definite pleural effusion is demonstrated on the left side.
