Lung volumes are low and exaggerate the cardiac and mediastinal contours. Endotracheal tube tip is in the lower trachea at 2.7 cm from the carina. Enteric tube tip is in the gastric fundus with the side hole in the lower esophagus. Mild left basilar atelectasis is noted; otherwise, the lungs are clear with no evidence of a consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. Atherosclerotic calcifications are again noted at the aortic arch. Previously noted projection of the lateral margin of the thoracic aorta extending laterally beyond the curvilinear calcifications at the arch is not clearly evaluated today due to overlying mediastinal contours. No acute fractures are identified.
