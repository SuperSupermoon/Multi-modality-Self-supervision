The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. There are persistently low lung volumes. The heart size remains moderately enlarged, and mediastinal contours are stable. There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, with bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflective of atelectasis. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no overt pulmonary edema is present. Small bilateral pleural effusions likely persist. There is no pneumothorax. Clips in the right upper quadrant denote prior cholecystectomy.
