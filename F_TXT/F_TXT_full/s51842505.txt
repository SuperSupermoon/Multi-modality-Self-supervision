Subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the chest tube insertion site at the left chest wall. There is left basal atelectasis and slight volume loss in the left lung. No pneumothorax is seen. There is blunting of the right CP angle which could indicate a small right pleural effusion. An azygos lobe is noted. Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.
