Right chest tube terminates near the right lung apex. There has been interval decrease in size of right apical pneumothorax which is now tiny. There is decreased opacity surrounding the right apical chain suture, consistent with resolving postoperative change. No pleural effusion is detected on this view. Heart and mediastinal contours are within normal limits. The left lung appears well aerated without evidence for pneumothorax.
