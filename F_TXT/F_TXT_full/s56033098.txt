Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There are very low lung volumes which limits evaluation. The left perihilar mass seen previously is not well seen on this study. There is blunting of both CP angles, which may represent pleural fluid. The heart size is difficult to assess due to the overlying gas within the fundus of the stomach and the low lung volumes. There are no pneumothoraces.
