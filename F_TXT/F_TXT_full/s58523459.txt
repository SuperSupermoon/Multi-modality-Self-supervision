The right lateral chest is not fully included on the image. Endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of view. Partially imaged right sided chest tube is noted which appears to course to the mediastinum. There is extensive left chest wall subcutaneous emphysema and multiple displaced left-sided rib fractures, including left third through seventh ribs, and possibly eighth rib. The left diaphragm is obscured which may be due to atelectasis, aspiration, pleural effusion, pulmonary contusion. The right lung is not well assessed, but is lower in volume than that on the left. Relative opacity projecting over the partially imaged right lung could be due to layering pleural effusion, aspiration, and/or pulmonary contusion. Dual lead left-sided pacer device has leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.
