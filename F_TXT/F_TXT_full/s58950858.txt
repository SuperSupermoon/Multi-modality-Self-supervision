Moderate-sized partially loculated left pleural effusion has increased in size and is accompanied by worsening left retrocardiac opacity, which may be due to atelectasis or infectious pneumonia. Small left apical pneumothorax is present and was also demonstrated on recent CT of one day earlier. Right lung is clear except for minor atelectasis at the right lung base.
