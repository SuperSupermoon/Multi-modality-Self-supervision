Combination of increasing left pleural effusion and collapse of the left lung is responsible for complete opacification of the left hemi thorax, with little mediastinal shift. Moderate right pleural effusion persists despite the right pleural drainage catheter. There is no pneumothorax. Right subclavian venous infusion port ends in the lower SVC. No pneumothorax.
