Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is seen. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are multilevel degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
