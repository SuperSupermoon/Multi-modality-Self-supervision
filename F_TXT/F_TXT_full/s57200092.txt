Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Mild-to-severe cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable. Bibasilar opacities larger on the right side are grossly unchanged, a combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis; superimposed infection in the appropiate clinical setting cannot be excluded. Mild pulmonary edema is stable. Right IJ catheter tip is at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. Left chest tube is in unchanged position. Sternal wires are aligned. There is no pneumothorax.
