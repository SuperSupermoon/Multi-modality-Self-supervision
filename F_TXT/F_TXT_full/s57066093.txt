There is no marked interval change of lungs when compared to the prior study. Once again seen are linear opacities in the left lung, which may be related to the overlying multiple rib fractures, or may represent some focal atelectasis. There is a left chest tube in place, but the side port lies just outside of the rib cage. An endotracheal tube is properly positioned. A nasogastric tube has been withdrawn and now lies with the side port just at the gastroesophageal junction. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The right lung is clear. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. A left scapular fracture and right second rib fracture are once again seen.
