As compared to the previous radiograph, the feeding tube has been removed. The right PICC line and the tracheostomy tube remain in situ. There is a newly occurred minimal left pleural effusion that causes blunting of the left costophrenic sinus. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, showing widespread bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting a combination of infection and pulmonary edema. The size of the cardiac silhouette is constant.
