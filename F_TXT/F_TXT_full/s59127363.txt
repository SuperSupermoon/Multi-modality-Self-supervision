In comparison with study of ___, there is no change in the appearance of the Swan-Ganz catheter, which extends well beyond the mediastinal border. It is recommended that the tube be pulled back about 5 cm to be within the mediastinum and decrease the chance of occlusion of a pulmonary artery branch. The endotracheal tube lies approximately 4.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. The IABP tip lies just above the level of the left mainstem bronchus. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and there is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the bases most likely reflects atelectasis with possible small effusion on the left.
