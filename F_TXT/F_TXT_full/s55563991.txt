There is a new focal opacity at the left lung base with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Diffuse prominence of lung vasculature within upper zone predominance and prominence of interstitial markings likely represents pulmonary edema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess due to parenchymal abnormalities. Median sternotomy wires are noted.
