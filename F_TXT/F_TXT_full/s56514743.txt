Compared with the prior study, the ET tube and NG tube have been removed. Right IJ sheath is now present instead of the Swan-Ganz catheter. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, possibly slightly more prominent. Sternotomy wires are noted. As before, the upper most sternotomy wire is interrupted. The patient's T AVR is noted. Diffuse opacities, right-greater-than-left are again visible. These are probably similar to prior. There is slightly increased prominence on the left, which may be accounted for by differences in technique. These are non-specific, but as previously described, compatible with pulmonary edema. In the appropriate clinical setting, the differential could include pneumonic infiltrates. No gross effusion is detected on either side.
