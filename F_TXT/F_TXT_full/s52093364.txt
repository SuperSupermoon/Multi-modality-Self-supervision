Frontal view of the chest was obtained. The radiograph is underpenetrated. The patient is in lordotic position with respect to the film. Endotracheal tube terminates 5.6 cm above the carina. The full course of the OG tube is unable to be followed. Left PICC is unable to be followed further than the left brachiocephalic. Left IJ also appears to terminate in the left brachiocephalic vein. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Prominent pulmonary vasculature is compatible with mild congestion. No substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
