On the prior study, there was a femoral Swan-Ganz catheter that is no longer visualized. It is off the film. It has likely been pulled back. Left IJ line tip is in the SVC. Cardiac pacer with wires is again visualized. ET tube is unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusions have increased in size compared to the prior study. The heart size is moderately enlarged and is larger than on the prior exam. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution with perihilar haze. The overall impression is that of worsening CHF.
