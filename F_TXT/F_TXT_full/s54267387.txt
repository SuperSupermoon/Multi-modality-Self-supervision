Compared to prior study there appears to be worsening of the left-sided opacification which appears to be within nearly the entire left lung with obliteration of the left heart border and left hemidiaphragm. There is a small focus of relative hyperlucency in the left cardiophrenic angle compared to the rest of the lung and may represent a small, loculated pneumothorax. The orogastric tube has been removed. There is otherwise no change compared the prior study with persistent pulmonary edema. A right dual lumen dialysis catheter is unchanged in position. Remnant of a left-sided dialysis catheter is unchanged in position with a small piece of the tip broken off and lodged in a distal left pulmonary artery, unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube remains in place in appropriate position.
