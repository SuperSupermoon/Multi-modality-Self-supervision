AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. Markedly increased basal density in the right hemithorax is indicative of rapid development of pleural effusion. No significant mediastinal shift noted. Left side is better aerated and shows a plate atelectasis on the base. The pulmonary vasculature does not show any marked congestive pattern and the left lateral pleural sinus remains free.
