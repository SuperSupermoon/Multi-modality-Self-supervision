In comparison with study of ___, there is little change in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacification, somewhat worse on the left, consistent with large layering pleural effusions. Extensive atelectatic changes are also seen at the bases with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
