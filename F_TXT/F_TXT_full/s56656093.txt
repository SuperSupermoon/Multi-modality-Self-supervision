A single portable frontal radiograph of the chest was acquired. There is redemonstration of intact sternotomy wires as well as surgical clips scattered throughout the lower thorax, unchanged. The previously seen vascular stent projecting over the mid abdomen is only partially imaged on today's study. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is increased compared to the prior study. There is a dense retrocardiac opacification, increased, possibly secondary to atelectasis, although infection and/or aspiration could have an identical appearance. Small bilateral pleural effusions are not significantly changed. There is persistent pulmonary vascular congestion without frank interstitial edema. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are unchanged.
