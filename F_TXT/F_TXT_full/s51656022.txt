Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrate increased opacification of the right hemithorax, with persistently enlarged cardiac silhouette and engorged hilar vasculature, consistent with pulmonary edema. There is dense opacification of the retrocardiac space which may represent atelectasis, however pneumonia can be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no pneumothorax. A right-sided PICC line ends at the cavoatrial junction. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
