1. Interval appearance of diffuse airspace process, most likely representing mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, less likely diffuse pneumonia. There is persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with adjacent more confluent airspace opacity, which could reflect confluent pulmonary edema or an area of atelectasis. There is some overlying motion artifact on the study as well. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess but likely unchanged. Portion of the spinal fusion hardware is seen overlying the lower cervical spine. The described right upper lobe nodular opacity is not well appreciated on the current study due to the diffuse airspace process.
