Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm from the carina. A catheter courses along the left aspect of the chest, presumably a VP shunt catheter. Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Low lung volumes are present. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is present. No pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is detected. Multiple radiopaque punctate foreign bodies are seen projecting over the right hemithorax and right shoulder, presumably shrapnel.
