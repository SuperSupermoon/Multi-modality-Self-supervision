Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. No change to the positioning of the left-sided pacer leads projecting over the right atrium and right ventricle. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again noted. Hilar congestion again noted without overt pulmonary edema. Small pleural effusions are likely present. Bony structures appear intact.
