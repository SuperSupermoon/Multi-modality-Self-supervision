As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Crowding of the vascular and interstitial structures at the right lung bases and around the right hilus, caused by elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The left lung is unremarkable, with the exception of a small atelectasis in the periphery of the left lung bases. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax or larger pleural effusions.
