Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with a small right apicolateral pneumothorax, which is decreased in size since the prior radiograph. The apical visceral pleural line is now just below the second posterior right rib level. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Worsening left retrocardiac opacities, likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion, and note is made of improving atelectasis at the right base. Persistent subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall.
