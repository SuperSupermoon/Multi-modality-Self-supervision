Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. There is no pneumothorax or obvious lung collapse. Extensive lung consolidations have minimally increased in the left upper lobe. ET tube is high, the tip is 7.5 cm above the carina; can be advanced a couple of centimeters for a more standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. ECMO cannula tip is in unchanged position at the IVC. Amount of pleural fluid is difficult to evaluate, probably unchanged, larger on the left side. Cardiac silhouette is obscured by the parenchymal abnormalities.
