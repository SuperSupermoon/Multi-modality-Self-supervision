As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube is in unchanged position, with its tip approximately 5-6 cm above the carina. The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, the tip projects over the mildly distended stomach. The right PICC line and right internal jugular vein catheter are also unchanged. A tubular device parallels the contour of the right hemidiaphragm but is not entirely included in the image. No pneumothorax.
