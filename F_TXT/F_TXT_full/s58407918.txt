The NG tube has been advanced. The side port is not included in the film anymore, so we are assuming it is in adequate position. The endotracheal tube ends at 4.3 cm above the carina. The rest of the exam is unchanged with mild pulmonary edema and more focal opacification in the right upper lung where pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. The mild left pleural effusion and right moderate-to-severe pleural effusion is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly.
