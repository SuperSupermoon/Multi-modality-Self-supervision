Exam is somewhat limited due to extremely low lung volumes accentuating the cardiomediastinal contours and resulting in crowding of bronchovascular structures. Known tracheal stenosis is seen to better detail on prior CT. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Bibasilar opacities are suggestive of atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
