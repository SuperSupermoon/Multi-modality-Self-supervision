Moderate left pleural effusion persists. Pigtail drainage catheter is barely visible, projecting over the left lower chest. Absence of rightward mediastinal shift and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm reflects severe left lower lobe atelectasis. Right juxta hilar lung nodule noted. Heart is probably not enlarged of the cardiac apex is obscured. No right pleural abnormality. Widened mediastinal contour could reflect central adenopathy.
