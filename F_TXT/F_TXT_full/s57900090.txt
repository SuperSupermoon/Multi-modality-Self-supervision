Moderate pulmonary edema is worsened since earlier in the day, with slight increase in small bilateral pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is stable, given the difference between PA and AP techniques. What is most mysterious is the apparent decrease in size or resolution of a 5 cm mass seen on the chest CT chest just 5 hr earlier. If the lesion has indeed involuted, it is presumably a hematoma. However I would recommend a lateral view to see whether it is still present and a diminished by the change in size of a posterior lesion between PA and AP projections.
