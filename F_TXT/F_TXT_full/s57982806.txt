Right jugular shunt catheter ends in the main pulmonary artery ET tube ends 3 cm from carina bifurcation and should be withdrawn 2 cm. NG tube ends in the distal gastric cavity, so the tip is not visualized. New venous device in IVC. Lung volumes are persistently low with bilateral widespread opacification for moderate-to-severe lung volume-dependent pulmonary edema, which has slightly improved since prior CXR. Increased opacification of the left lung base for left lower lobe collapse. Heart size is moderately enlarged with enlargement of the upper mediastinum for central vein dilatation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
