1. The film was acquired with a somewhat lordotic technique. Therefore, it is felt that the cardiomediastinal contours are likely upper limits of normal given technique, although the heart does have a somewhat globular appearance which could sugggest mild cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion should also be considered. The lung volumes are low with streaky opacities at both bases likely reflecting bibasilar atelectasis, although an early infectious process cannot be excluded. Followup imaging would be advised. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusions. No acute bony abnormality appreciated.
