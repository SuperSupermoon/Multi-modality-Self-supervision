Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are relatively low lung volumes. Increased interstitial markings bilaterally are likely due to patient's known chronic lung disease. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. No definite focal consolidation. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. Degenerative changes are seen at the shoulder joints.
