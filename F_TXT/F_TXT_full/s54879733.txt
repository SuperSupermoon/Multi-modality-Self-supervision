In comparison to the recent chest radiograph performed one day prior, there is no significant change. Again noted are bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right than the left, with associated atelectasis. There is no evidence of consolidation, edema, or pneumothorax. The shape of the trachea suggests COPD. The mediastinal contours are normal. The heart is moderately enlarged, which is due to the known pericardial effusion. There is no change in the heart size.
