In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 4 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends into the stomach. Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. There are lower lung volumes than on the previous study. Areas of atelectasis are seen at the bases with blunting of the costophrenic angles consistent with pleural fluid. There is some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, consistent with the clinical impression of fluid overload and elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Although no discrete focal pneumonia is appreciated, this would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
