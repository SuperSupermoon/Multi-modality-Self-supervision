A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends 1.8 cm above the carina. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities may represent infection or hemorrhage in the setting of blood from the endotracheal tube. Heart size is normal. Evaluation of the mediastinum is limited by overlying trauma board.
