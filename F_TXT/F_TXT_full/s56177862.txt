The lung volumes are low. Tip of the endotracheal tube projects 42 mm above the carina. A right internal jugular vein catheter has been placed. The tip of the catheter projects over the right atrium, the catheter should be pulled back by approximately 3 cm. The course of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not represented on the image. There is moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral atelectasis and volume loss in the middle lobe. The perihilar haze indicates minimal fluid overload, which is confirmed by the borderline diameter of the azygos vein. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or larger pleural effusions.
