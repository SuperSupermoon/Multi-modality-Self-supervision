In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, a Dobhoff tube has advanced minimally into the distal stomach. Small left pleural effusion and mild cardiomegaly are unchanged. No pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. Lungs are otherwise fully expanded and clear without focal consolidations. Margin of the left breast implant is calcified. Increased density over the right chest likely reflects right breast implant without a calcified margin.
