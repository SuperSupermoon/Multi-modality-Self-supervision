Left lung lavage was recently done, explaining probably the increased density of left middle lung. There is a small left pneumothorax measuring 3 to 6 mm. Mild pulmonary edema is new. Pleural effusions are small, if any. Minor fissure on the right side is slightly thickened with an atelectatic band in right lower lung. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are moderately enlarged. Aortic knob calcification is unchanged. Patient had prior sternotomy for aortic valve, mitral valve and tricuspid valve repair.
