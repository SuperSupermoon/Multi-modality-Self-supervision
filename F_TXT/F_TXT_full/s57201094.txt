ET tube has been removed, revealing mild indentation of the lower cervical trachea. This could be due to edema from recent intubation, prior stricture or enlargement of the lobes of the thyroid. Followup advised. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable, but moderate left pleural effusion and mediastinal venous engorgement have increased and there is more atelectasis at the right lung base. Left lower lobe is still substantially airless. The pulmonary vasculature is more engorged, but pulmonary edema has not developed. There is no pneumothorax. The right pleural drain is still in place. Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the region of the pulmonic valve.
