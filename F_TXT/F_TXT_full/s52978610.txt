There is again a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle. The heart is again moderately enlarged. There is perhaps minimal similar upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vessels without frank pulmonary edema. Noting that the left hemidiaphragm is obscured by a pacer device, the area is not well evaluated, making it difficult to exclude a pleural effusion in particular. There is no evidence for pleural effusion on the right.
