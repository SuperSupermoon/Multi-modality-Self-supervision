Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax with leftward mediastinal shift consistent with a massive left pleural effusion and left lung collapse. Stable moderate-large right-sided pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Assessment of the cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are not possible to assess secondary to large pleural effusion. Chronic left shoulder dislocation and pseudoarthrosis with clavicle again noted.
