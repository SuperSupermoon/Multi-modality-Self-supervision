As compared to the previous radiograph, the right venous introduction sheath has been removed and a left PICC line has been inserted. The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the mid SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities, mostly caused by pleural effusions and subsequent atelectasis, have decreased in extent.
