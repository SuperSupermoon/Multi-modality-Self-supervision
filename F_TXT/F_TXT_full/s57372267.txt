Endotracheal tube tip is 5.7 cm from the carina. Enteric tube passes below the diaphragm with tip in the gastric body, side port is in the region of the GE junction. Lung volumes are lower and there is bibasilar atelectasis. Right basilar focal opacity behind the heart may also be due to atelectasis though infection would be difficult to exclude. There is superimposed mild pulmonary edema and a suspected small left pleural effusion. Degree of cardiomegaly is unchanged.
