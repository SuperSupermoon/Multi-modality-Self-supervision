A left PICC is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in the proximal SVC. There is no significant interval change in the extent of pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema from ___. Opacification at the left lung base is unchanged, likely reflecting a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis. There is improved aeration of the right lung base. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, but stable. The mediastinal contours are prominent, but unchanged. There is partial calcification of the aortic knob.
