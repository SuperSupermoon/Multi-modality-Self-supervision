There has been interval appearance of bibasilar airspace opacities with associated effusion, left greater than right. The imaging appearance would favor pulmonary edema rather than aspiration or pneumonia given the time interval, but clinical correlation would be recommended. There is underlying biapical parenchymal distortion with extensive bullous changes at the right apex consistent with known emphysema. Interval placement of a right internal jugular large bore catheter with its tip in the proximal SVC. Calcification of the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac size is stable.
