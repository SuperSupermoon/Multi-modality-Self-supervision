Portable AP upright view of the chest was provided. There is again noted to be post-surgical change of the left lung apex with volume loss and leftward retraction of the mediastinal structures. There is also evidence of prior left upper rib cage resection with chest wall deformity evident. The right lung is hyperinflated with upper lobe lucency, likely reflecting underlying emphysema. Coarsened interstitial markings with micronodular opacity in the right lower lung likely reflect scarring and appears stable from prior exam. The left CP angle is excluded thus limiting evaluation. No definite new consolidation in the left lung to suggest the presence of pneumonia. The heart size appears stable.
