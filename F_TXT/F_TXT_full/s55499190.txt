As compared to the previous radiograph, there is massive over distension of the stomach. The over distended stomach causes elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with reduction of lung volumes. Subsequent areas of retrocardiac atelectasis are visualized. In addition, there is an increase in diameter of the vascular structures, likely reflecting mild pulmonary edema. Finally, new opacities are visualized at the bases of the right lung. These could be caused by a atelectasis or reflect aspiration or pneumonia. Short term radiographic followup should be performed.
