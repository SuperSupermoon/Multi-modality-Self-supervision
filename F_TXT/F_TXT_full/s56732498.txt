AP portable semi upright view of the chest. Diffuse pulmonary edema is noted. Difficult to exclude small effusions though no large effusion is seen. No large pneumothorax. Subtle retrocardiac opacity may represent focal consolidation. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly stable. Bony structures appear intact. High riding right humeral head is noted which likely reflect underlying chronic rotator cuff disease.
