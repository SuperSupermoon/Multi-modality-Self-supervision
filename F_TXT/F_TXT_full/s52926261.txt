Lung volumes are severely decreased, leading to crowding of the bronchovascular structures. Again, bibasilar atelectasis is noted. There is no lobar consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged in the prior examination. Calcifications are again seen at the aortic arch.
