As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in interstitial markings, most notable at the level of the bronchial walls and the peripheral interstitium. This change could reflect mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. Mild cardiomegaly. Normal recently placed right PICC line. No pleural effusions. No evidence of pneumonia.
