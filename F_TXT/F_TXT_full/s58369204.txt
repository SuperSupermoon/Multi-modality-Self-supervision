Endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carina. The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged. There has been interval removal of the nasogastric tube. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is improving aeration at the left base with residual patchy opacity which likely reflects persistent partial lower lobe atelectasis. Overall, the pulmonary markings are more prominent which suggests a component of superimposed mild pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax.
