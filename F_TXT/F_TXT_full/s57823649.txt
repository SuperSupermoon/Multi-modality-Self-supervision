Lungs hyperinflated. Cardiomegaly is severe. Heterogeneously distributed interstitial abnormality could be edema in the setting of emphysema. There are at least 2 small nodules in the right mid and upper lung, best evaluated with CT scanning. CT scanning would also be helpful to see if there is a focus of pneumonia in the left midlung projecting superior to the cardiac apex. Left-sided skin fold should not be mistaken pleural effusion or pneumothorax, and pleural effusion if any is minimal. Leftward displacement of the trachea at the thoracic inlet is most often due to an enlarged right thyroid lobe.
