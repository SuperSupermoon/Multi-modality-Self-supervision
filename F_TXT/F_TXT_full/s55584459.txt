Linear opacities are present in the left lower lung zone, likely reflective of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. The size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Note is made of free air under both hemidiaphragms, presumed to be secondary to the recent PEG tube placement.
