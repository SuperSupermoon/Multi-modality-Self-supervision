AP chest compared to ___ and ___ at 1:01 a.m. Lung volumes are lower and there is greater opacification in the lungs, particularly the bases. The simplest explanation is worsening of pulmonary edema, but since the heart is not larger and mediastinal veins are not more dilated, the explanation could be something very different, depending upon whether the patient is febrile or having hemoptysis one would consider concurrent pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage. Pleural effusions could be present, but are not appreciable. There is no pneumothorax.
