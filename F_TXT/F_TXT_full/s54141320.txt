A portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained. Evaluation is limited secondary to patient rotation. A tracheostomy tube projects over the left upper lung. The PEG tube is not well visualized on this exam. There is no obvious focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. No dilated loops of bowel are seen within the visualized abdomen.
