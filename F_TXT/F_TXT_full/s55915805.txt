The cardiomediastinal hilar contours are stable with moderate to severe cardiomegaly. Dilated mediastinal vessels are chronic in appearance. Left lower lobe consolidation is a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, although infection is not excluded. A small right pleural effusion is likely, and right basilar consolidation, reflecting atelectasis or pneumonia, is increased. There is no pneumothorax. ETT is in standard position. Enteric tube is seen coursing towards the stomach with distal tip not captured on the current study. Internal jugular line is present with tip terminating in the mid to low SVC.
