There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube with pigtail projecting over the right mid lung field. There has been interval resolution of the previously noted right hydropneumothorax with re-expansion of the right lung. Trace right pleural effusion is likely present, and minimal atelectasis is seen in the right lung base. Previously noted leftward shift of mediastinal structures has also resolved. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Left lung is clear.
