Cardiomegaly is accompanied by improving pulmonary vascular congestion and decreasing pulmonary edema. Left retrocardiac opacity has substantially improved, likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion. A more confluent opacity at the right lung base persists, and could be due to asymmetrically resolving edema, but pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Small right pleural effusion is likely unchanged, with pigtail pleural catheter remaining in place and no visible pneumothorax.
