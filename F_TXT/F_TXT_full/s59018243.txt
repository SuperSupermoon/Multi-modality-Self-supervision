Worsening left retrocardiac opacity with associated inferior displacement of left hilum favors worsening left lower lobe atelectasis, but coexisting pneumonia is possible, particularly in the setting of poorly defined adjacent opacities in the mid and lower lung regions. Additionally, in the right lung, a worsening patchy and linear opacity is present with associated volume loss. Small pleural effusions are similar to the prior study.
