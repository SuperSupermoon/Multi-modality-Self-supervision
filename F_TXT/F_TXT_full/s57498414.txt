Endotracheal tube is low lying, at the level of the carina and approaching the right mainstem bronchus. Enteric tube tip is within the stomach. Lung volumes are low. Mild enlargement of cardiac silhouette is demonstrated. The aorta appears tortuous. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Apparent widening of the superior mediastinum is likely due to supine positioning and low lung volumes. Linear and streaky opacities in the lung bases most likely reflect areas of atelectasis. Aspiration cannot be completely excluded. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. The stomach demonstrates mild gaseous distention.
