As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the very low position of the endotracheal tube, are unchanged. Unchanged very low lung volumes with signs of mild fluid overload and bilateral blunting of the costophrenic sinus, suggesting the presence of minimal pleural effusions. No pneumonia but atelectases at both lung bases are present.
