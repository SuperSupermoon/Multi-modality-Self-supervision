Minnesota tube in place with the fundic balloon fully inflated, several cm below the level of the esophagogastric junction. ET tube ends at the thoracic inlet, left internal jugular line in the left brachiocephalic vein, dialysis catheter set in the right atrium. Lung volumes are lower, exaggerating mild pulmonary edema and moderate cardiomegaly. The left perihilar consolidation is more pronounced, either pneumonia or atelectasis. No pneumothorax.
