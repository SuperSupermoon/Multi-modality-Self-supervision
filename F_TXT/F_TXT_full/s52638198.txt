Lung volumes are low. There is a retrocardiac opacity, which is likely atelectasis, although in the proper clinical setting, a pneumonia cannot be excluded. The right lung is clear. There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal, and likely accentuated by low lung volumes and positioning. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted along the aortic arch. A fracture is noted through the body of the right scapula.
