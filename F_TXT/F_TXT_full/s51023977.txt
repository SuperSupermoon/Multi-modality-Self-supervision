Lung volumes are low, similar in appearance when compared to the prior study. The tracheostomy and a left PICC are unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study. The heart remains enlarged. There is persistent enlargement of the bilateral hila with prominent pulmonary vasculature and bilateral perihilar airspace opacities. The appearances are most consistent with pulmonary edema but infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax seen.
