There has been interval development of a prominent interstitial pattern, more on the right than the left, as well as more focal patchy opacities in the right upper and lower lung and in the retrocardiac region. Given the interval change, this would favor mild pulmonary and interstitial edema rather than an infectious process. There is possibly a small left effusion. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. A nasogastric tube is seen coiled within the stomach. No pneumothorax.
