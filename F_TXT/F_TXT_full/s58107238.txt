Lungs well expanded. There is been interval development of a homogeneous opacity in the right lung base, most consistent with a pleural fluid collection. The morphology of this collection is suspicious for possible loculated effusion. Above this fluid collection, there is an area of consolidation that could represent atelectasis but is concerning for pneumonia in the right clinical setting. There is increased retrocardiac fullness along the contour of the descending aorta, which could represent fluid in the mediastinum. A trace left pleural effusion is seen. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. There has been interval removal of the previously seen NG tube.
