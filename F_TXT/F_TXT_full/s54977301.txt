Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. There are bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. Left base retrocardiac opacity likely relates to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Previously seen opacity along the right heart border has decreased in the interval. Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.
