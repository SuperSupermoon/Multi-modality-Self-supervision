AP portable view of the chest demonstrates repositioned right PIC catheter projecting at mid SVC. It appears appropriately positioned without previously seen terminal coil in this projection. Left costophrenic angle is not fully included in the study. Small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion persists with adjacent area of opacity, likely compressive atelectasis persists. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Mild cardiomegaly is again noted.
