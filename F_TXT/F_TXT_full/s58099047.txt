Multiple tubes have been removed. Right IJ central line remains present, tip near SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax detected. There are low inspiratory volumes, slightly smaller than seen on ___. Small bilateral effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation is likely similar, allowing for differences in positioning, inspiratory volumes and technique. Small right effusion may be slightly increased. Cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular engorgement is likely unchanged, allowing for technical differences.
