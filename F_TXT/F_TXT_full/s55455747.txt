CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 4:23 a.m., there has been slight progression of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, with new obscuration of the medial left hemidiaphragm. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged but stable. Upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora is consistent with mild CHF. Atelectasis at the right base and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle are also unchanged. Surgical ___ noted over upper abdomen. No free air is seen beneath the diaphragms on this upright film.
