The patient is now extubated. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with minimal interstitial edema are new since the pre-extubation radiograph. Bibasilar linear opacities reflect atelectasis, slightly worse at the left base. Small underlying consolidations at the bases cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain unchanged.
