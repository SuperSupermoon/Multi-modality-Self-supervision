Overall, there is no significant interval change. The patient is rotated to the right. Tracheostomy tube and right PICC line are grossly stable in position. An enteric tube is seen, distal aspect not well appreciated due to underpenetration below the level of the diaphragm, likely also courses below the inferior aspect of the image. Perihilar opacities likely due to pulmonary edema with bibasilar opacities similar to the prior study, likely representing combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis, although underlying infection or aspiration not excluded.
