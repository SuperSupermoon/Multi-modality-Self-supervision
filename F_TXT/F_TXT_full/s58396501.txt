AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___. There is interval development/progression of the right mid and lower lobe consolidation which most likely represents a combination of atelectasis and potentially infectious process. Small amount of pleural effusion is present. Right mediastinal shift is explained by the atelectasis, which most likely involves right middle and lower lobes. There is also left lower lobe opacity although slightly improved since the prior study. There is no evidence of appreciable pulmonary edema.
