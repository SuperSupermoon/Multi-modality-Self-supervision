A left subclavian central venous catheter ends in the lower SVC. Bilateral large pleural effusions and associated compressive atelectasis of both lung bases have slightly worsened since the prior study. The remainder of the aerated lung appears unremarkable except for mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The assessment of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is limited due to the large effusions. Multiple intact sternotomy wires are present.
