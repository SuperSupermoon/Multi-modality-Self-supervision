Comparison is made with prior study ___. Cardiac size is top normal. There are persistent low lung volumes. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Multifocal opacities in the right upper, right lower, and left lower lobes are stable. Multifocal lung nodular opacities, though less conspicuous than before are still present. All these lung opacities are likely multifocal pneumonia.
