1. Marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Dilated cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion should be considered as possible etiologies. 2. Findings suggesting mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. 3. No evidence for free air. 4. Limited visualization of the left lung base owing to portable technique and underpenetration associated with attenuation of soft tissues. If physical findings or other concern referred to the site, then follow-up radiographs could be considered, preferably with PA and lateral technique, if possible.
