In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a dual-channel pacer with leads extending to the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle. No evidence a pneumothorax. There is engorgement of pulmonary vessels. This could reflect some increase in pulmonary venous pressure, though the current images supine rather than erect as well as AP rather than PA, which could also accentuate the pulmonary markings. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
