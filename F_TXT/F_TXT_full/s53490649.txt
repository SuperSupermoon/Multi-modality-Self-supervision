There has been interval placement of a right-sided catheter with pigtail projecting over the liver. A persistent moderate size right pneumothorax remains with continued leftward shift of mediastinal structures as seen on the chest CT scout. Increased subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral chest wall is noted. Streaky opacities are noted in the right lung likely reflective of atelectasis. Low lung volumes are present which results in crowding of bronchovascular structures and left basilar atelectasis. Cardiac and mediastinal contours otherwise remain unchanged. Right lateral rib fractures are better assessed on the previous CT.
