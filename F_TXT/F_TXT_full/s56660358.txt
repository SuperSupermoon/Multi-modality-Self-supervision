As compared to the previous radiograph, the known left pleural effusion has slightly increased. Stable is the extent of a left basal parenchymal opacity and a left partial lower lobe atelectasis. The monitoring and support devices are constant. No new parenchymal opacities. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette, a pre-existing mild atelectasis at the right lung base has resolved in the interval.
