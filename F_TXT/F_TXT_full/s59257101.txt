AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. After right thoracocentesis, there has been substantial interval decrease of right pleural effusion with only minimal amount of fluid left. The pigtail catheter is in place. There is minimal apical pneumothorax present that should be further followed. Left pleural effusion is substantial, unchanged as well as left basal consolidation. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is overall improvement in right infrahilar opacity.
