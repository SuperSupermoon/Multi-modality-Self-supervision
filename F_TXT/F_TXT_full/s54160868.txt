Left right-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. Lung volumes are low. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour may be due to low lung volumes. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. Hazy opacities are noted in the mid lung fields bilaterally, more so on the left. Small left pleural effusion is likely present. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
