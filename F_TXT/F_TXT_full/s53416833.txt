Portable frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates the ET tube ending 2.9 cm above the carina. An NG tube is within the stomach. The left central venous catheter has an unusual course with the tip projecting to the left of midline over the aortic arch. This could represent arterial placement or placement in the small vein but does not appear to be within the central venous structures. Otherwise, there is stable appearance of the chest with normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours. The right costophrenic angle is excluded from this image. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
