In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are generally stable, with the Swan-Ganz catheter tip now within the mediastinal portion of the right pulmonary artery. The hyperlucency of the right lower chest laterally is less prominent on the current study. Continued retrocardiac opacification is consistent with a combination of pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, consistent with the preoperative appearance. Mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure is again seen.
