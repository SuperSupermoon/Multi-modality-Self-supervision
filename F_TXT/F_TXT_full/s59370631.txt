Technically extremely limited image. Only the right hemi thorax and parts of the left medial hemi thorax are shown. Better visible than on the previous image are multiple rounded opacities of soft tissue density, located in the right lung, and suggesting the presence of metastatic disease. Blunting of the right costophrenic sinus could suggest the presence of a minimal right pleural effusion. The patient is intubated and the visible parts of the support devices are in correct position. The heart is not entirely visible. No evidence of a right pneumothorax.
