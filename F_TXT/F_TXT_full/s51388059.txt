AP chest compared to ___ and earlier on ___: Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened minimally and heart size has increased slightly, but there is no pulmonary edema. Consolidation at the base of the right lung has disappeared into worsened right lower lobe atelectasis. Heterogeneous opacification in the left mid lung is slightly improved. Findings suggest aspiration may have been responsible for changes in both lungs, and cardiac decompensation ensued. Right pleural effusion is small on the right if any. No pneumothorax.
