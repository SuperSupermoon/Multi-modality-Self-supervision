As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring and support devices are in constant position, except for the endotracheal tube that has been advanced and now projects 2.5 cm above the carina with its tip, and the left chest tube that has been removed in the interval. Also removed is a previously placed left subclavian catheter. Mild retrocardiac atelectasis but no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumonia or pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
