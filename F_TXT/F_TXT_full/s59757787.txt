No previous images. There are relatively low lung volumes with cardiac silhouette within normal limits and no vascular congestion. There is a small amount of opacification in the retrocardiac area and at the costophrenic angle. This most likely represents atelectasis and mild effusion. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
