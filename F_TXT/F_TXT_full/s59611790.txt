Lung volumes remain low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. There is increased opacity at the right upper lung which could be related to prominence of the azygos fissure and azygous vein due to increased venous pressures. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, these findings could also be related to aspiration. In addition, there is an increased area of opacity along the right perihilar region and right lung base which could be related to atelectatic changes. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, early pneumonia should also be considered. A left PICC line remains unchanged, terminating in the mid SVC.
