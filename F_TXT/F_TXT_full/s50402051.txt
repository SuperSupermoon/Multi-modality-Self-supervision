In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued and possibly increased hazy opacification in the right hemithorax, consistent with layering effusion. Retrocardiac opacification persists, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and small effusion. The pulmonary vessels are increasingly engorged and indistinct, suggesting overhydration.
