Right PICC tip is in mid SVC. Stable bilateral diffuse reticular opacities and heterogeneous opacities with peribronchial cuffing and focal areas of luceny, suggesting a stable acute interstitial and alveolar process on a scaffolding of severe emphysema. Emphysema is better characterized on CT. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contour are normal. Unchanged diffuse sclerotic lesions from known metastatic disease.
