Heart size remains mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. A small right pleural effusion persists with associated right basilar compressive atelectasis. Streaky left opacity in the left lung base also likely reflects atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are re- demonstrated in the thoracic spine.
