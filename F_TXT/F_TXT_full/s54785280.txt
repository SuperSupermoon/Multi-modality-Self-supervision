An ET tube is present approximately 3.6 cm above the carina. The enteric tube is present the distal tip off the film. There is no pneumothorax. There are small bilateral effusions. Dense calcified opacities in both upper lung fields and hila are noted, consistent with prior history of tuberculosis. Atelectasis or consolidation of the lung bases are noted. Reticular changes are also noted, which may be acute or chronic.
