Endotracheal tube terminates 5.8 cm above the carina. NG tube terminates below the diaphragm. There is increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with aspiration or infection. Linear opacity in the right lower lobe is consistent with atelectasis. A small left pleural effusion is not excluded. No pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal contours are stable.
