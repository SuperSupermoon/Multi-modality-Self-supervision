Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the upper SVC. No large pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam, however the costophrenic angles bilaterally are not fully included in the field of view. Remainder of the exam is unchanged with stable cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours. Persistent bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
