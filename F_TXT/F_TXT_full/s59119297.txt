Chain sutures are noted at the left lung apex and a left-sided chest tube is present. No well-defined pneumothorax is identified. The possibility of a tiny residual pneumothorax cannot be entirely excluded. Again seen is patchy opacity at the left lung base, consistent with collapse and/or consolidation. Probable slight improvement in the more nodular opacities seen at the left base laterally. Probable small left effusion, unchanged. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base again noted. No new focal opacity detected. The right lung and costophrenic angle is otherwise grossly clear. Mild gastric distention again noted.
