Since the prior study there has been slight interval progression in the left perihilar and potentially lower lobe opacity as well as in the right costophrenic angle opacity although the difference may be explained by patient rotation. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. No increase in pleural effusion or development of pneumothorax is present
