AP chest compared to ___ on ___: In addition to generalized mild pulmonary edema, there are large areas of consolidation in the right lower and left upper perihilar lungs. Given chronic cardiomegaly, and a similarly asymmetric pattern on prior chest radiographs, this could be pulmonary edema alone. Chronic cardiomegaly is severe and pulmonary vasculature is markedly engorged. The possibility of concurrent or initiating pneumonia cannot be excluded radiographically, only by its response to diuresis and other hemodynamically interventions. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax.
