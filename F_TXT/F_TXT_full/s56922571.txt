The patient is status post left upper lobectomy with several clips demonstrated in the left mid lung field. Linear and patchy opacities within the medial left lung base likely reflect atelectatic changes, with leftward shift of mediastinal structures and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm compatible with evidence of volume loss. The amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall has decreased since the previous study, and the previously demonstrated small left apical pneumothorax appears to have resolved with a small amount of fluid now seen in the left pleural space. The right lung is clear. There is no right-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
