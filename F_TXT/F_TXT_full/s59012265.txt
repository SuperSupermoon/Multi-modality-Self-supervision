There are low lung volumes. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely mildly enlarged but unchanged. The aorta remains tortuous. A moderate-sized hiatal hernia is again demonstrated. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Patchy ill-defined opacities within the lung bases could reflect atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded. A trace right pleural effusion may be present. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
