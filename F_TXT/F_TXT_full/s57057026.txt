Endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of view. There are low lung volumes. Previously seen bibasilar opacities have decreased in the interval with possible minimal residua remaining at the left lung base, which could be due to atelectasis or aspiration. No large pleural effusion pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
