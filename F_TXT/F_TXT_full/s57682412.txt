A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. The endotracheal tube ends 4.2 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube follows the expected course, although the tip is not visualized. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged with a heavily calcified mitral annulus. Aortic knob calcifications are seen in a tortuous aorta. There is multilevel degenerative change in the lumbar spine with levoconvex scoliosis, incompletely evaluated on this study.
