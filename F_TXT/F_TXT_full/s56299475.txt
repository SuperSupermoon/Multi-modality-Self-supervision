Lung volumes are lower compared to the previous exam, which accounts for the slight increase in size of the cardiac silhouette. Heart size does appear mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified at the aortic knob. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Patchy retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis. There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. No subdiaphragmatic free air is identified.
