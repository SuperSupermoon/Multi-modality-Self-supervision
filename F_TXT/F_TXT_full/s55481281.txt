Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is present and has slightly worsened since the recent radiograph. Right apical pneumothorax appears unchanged. Homogeneous increased opacity extending from the peripheral aspect of the right upper lobe sleeve resection suture lines peripherally to the right hilum centrally has increased in density since the previous radiograph. This may represent post-operative collapse of the right middle lobe. If warranted clinically, CT of the chest may be helpful to better characterize this region and to exclude other post-operative complication.
