AP chest compared to ___, read in conjunction with a chest CTA on ___: There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Vague increase in radiodensity in the left lower lung could be due to retained secretions or hemorrhage. Small lung lesions evident on the chest CT are barely visible on bedside radiographs. It would be sensible to obtain PA and lateral paired conventional chest radiographs, and presuming the CT findings are visible, use conventional radiographs as a means of monitoring progression. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.
