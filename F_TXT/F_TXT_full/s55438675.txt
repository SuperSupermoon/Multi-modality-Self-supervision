Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall are new. Distended gut in the right upper abdomen is new. There is still a substantial volume of stomach and intestine above the plane of the diaphragm, now containing more fluid than air. The large hernia exaggerates the heart size, but cardiomegaly is probably present also. There is no pneumothorax. Esophageal drainage tube ends in the stomach for above the diaphragm.
