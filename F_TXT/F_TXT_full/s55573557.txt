Right-sided pleural catheter remains in place. A small lateral pneumothorax is present below the level of the minor fissure. Additionally, a pleural effusion has increased in size and is partially layering on this semi-upright radiograph. A small loculated component has developed medially at the right apex as well. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and is accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Worsening confluent opacity at the right lung base is probably due to atelectasis, though infection should also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
