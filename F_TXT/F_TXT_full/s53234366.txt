Single frontal view of the chest. Endotracheal tube, left pleural tube, two mediastinal drains, and Swan-Ganz catheter have been removed. Sternotomy wires appear intact. A tiny left pneumothorax is slightly smaller than on ___. A right apical linear density with peripheral lucency may represent a new small right pneumothorax. Atelectasis at the left base is more pronounced, as expected post-extubation. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion. The heart remains mildly enlarged.
