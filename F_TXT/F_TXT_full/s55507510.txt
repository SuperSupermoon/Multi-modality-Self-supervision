Mediastinal contours are within normal limits, with a calcified aortic arch. There is stable at least mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The bilateral hila are within normal limits.

Retrocardiac opacity likely represents basilar atelectasis. There may be a trace/small left pleural effusion. There is no right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.
