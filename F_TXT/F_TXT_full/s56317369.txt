Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position 4.7 cm above the carina. Low lung volumes are noted. Nasogastric tube is not well assessed on the current study, though concurrently obtained abdominal radiograph demonstrates that it terminates in the proximal stomach. Intervally developed right basal opacity is likely atelectasis. The heart is mildly enlarged with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Left subclavian catheter terminates in the upper SVC.
