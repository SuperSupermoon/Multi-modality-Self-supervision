There is no pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. Blunting of the costophrenic angles is likely from overlying soft tissue. Despite technique, the heart size is mildly enlarged. A granuloma is seen in the right lung. The mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable. Calcifications are seen within the right neck, presumably within the carotid.
