Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Left subclavian PICC line with its tip in the proximal SVC. A right subclavian Port-A-Cath has its tip in the distal SVC. Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. There continue to be layering bilateral effusions with associated patchy airspace opacities likely reflecting atelectasis. Overall, there does not appear to be any significant interval change in appearance of the lungs. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No pneumothorax.
