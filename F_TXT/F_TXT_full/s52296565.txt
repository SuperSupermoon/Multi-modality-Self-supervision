The ET tube is approximately 5.8 cm above the carina. Feeding tube passes below the diaphragm with the tip not visualized in the field of view provided. Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding of bronchovascular markings. Cardiac silhouette is accentuated by low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacifications may represent layering pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis; however, underlying infectious process such as pneumonia cannot be completely excluded. Pulmonary edema is stable.
