There is little change compared to a prior examination with re-demonstration of mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Hilar contours are unchanged. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Increased prominence of the left heart border is likely due to ___ effect rather than pneumomediastinum and central mediastinum and superior mediastinum are unremarkable without evidence of free air or subcutaneous gas. The large cavitating left lower lobe mass previously described on CT is difficult to evaluate on this portable examination.
