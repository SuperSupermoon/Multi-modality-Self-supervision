The heart is enlarged, with overlying surgical clips and intact sternotomy wires. In the left upper and lower lobes, there is an opacity with an unusual configuration, corresponding with the pleural effusion seen on the CT from the same date, and suggesting possible loculation. There is calcification of the right basal pleura. There may be right-sided pleural effusion as well, however correlation with a CT chest is done for confirmation.
