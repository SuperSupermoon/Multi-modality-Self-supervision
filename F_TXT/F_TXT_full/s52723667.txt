A radiograph centered in the lower chest was obtained for assessment of the feeding tube. The tube terminates within the upper stomach. Previously present nasogastric tube has been removed. With the exception of tube placement and slight worsening of left lower lobe atelectasis, there has otherwise been no relevant change in appearance of the chest since the previous study performed earlier the same date.
