1. Nasogastric tube is again seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet. A left chest tube remains in place. A left subclavian central line continues to terminate in the proximal SVC. There is persistent triangular opacity at the right base likely reflecting atelectasis or pulmonary contusion. There is increasing consolidation in the retrocardiac region, also likely reflecting atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There is a layering left effusion. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Heart remains stably enlarged. Aorta is somewhat unfolded and tortuous. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
