Comparison is made to prior radiograph performed eight hours earlier. There is a Dobbhoff tube with distal tip way below the GE junction. There is a PICC line whose distal tip is in the right atrium. This could be pulled back 4.5 cm for more optimal placement. This was noted on the prior radiograph and discussed with the nursing staff at that time. There is again seen some atelectasis at the lung bases, right side worse than left. No pneumothoraces are identified.
