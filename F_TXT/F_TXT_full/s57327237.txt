The right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter continues to have its tip in the right interlobar artery. A right basilar pleural pigtail catheter remains in place and there continues to be patchy opacity at the right base as well as a multi loculated pleural effusion and/ which is not significantly changed. Stable right apical opacity likely reflects loculated fluid. Cardiac contour remains stably enlarged. Left lung is grossly clear. No pulmonary edema. No obvious pneumothorax.
