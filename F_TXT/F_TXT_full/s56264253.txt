Endotracheal tube terminates 4.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach. There is a left-sided hemodialysis catheter, which extends to the low SVC. Lung volumes remain low. There are bilateral pleural effusions, increased. There is diffuse hazy parenchymal opacity, most compatible with pulmonary edema in the setting of central vascular congestion and cardiomegaly. There is no new focal opacity to suggest pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax.
