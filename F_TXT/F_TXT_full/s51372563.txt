In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 4.3 cm above the carina. The tip of the nasogastric tube is in the upper stomach, with the side port just below the esophagogastric junction. If possible, this should be pushed forward. The patient has taken a better inspiration and the cardiac silhouette is essentially within normal limits. Opacification at the left base could reflect atelectasis and pleural effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
