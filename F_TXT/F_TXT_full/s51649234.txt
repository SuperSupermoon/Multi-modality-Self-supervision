There has been interval extubation and removal of an enteric catheter. The right internal jugular central venous catheter has been slightly withdrawn, now ending in the low SVC. A moderate layering left pleural effusion is not significantly changed. Although no definite right pleural effusion is seen on today's study, one was present on the prior CT from ___. Moderate left retrocardiac atelectasis is likely compressive from the adjacent effusion. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is improved. Heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax. Marked degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine are noted including dextroscoliosis. A displaced right proximal humeral fracture is redemonstrated.
