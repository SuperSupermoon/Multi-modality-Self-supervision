AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Cardiac silhouette moderately enlarged, upper lobe pulmonary vasculature minimally dilated. There is no good evidence for cardiac decompensation. Atelectasis is relatively mild, in the left lower lobe. Lungs are otherwise clear. No pleural effusion. There is probably no pneumomediastinum, but I would recommend followup radiographs with the patient erect, if that is of clinical concern.
