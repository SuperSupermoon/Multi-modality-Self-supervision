Single portable view of the chest is correlated to CT scan of the abdomen from earlier the same day performed at an outside hospital. There are bibasilar opacities, larger on the left than on the right which partially silhouette the hemidiaphragms. There is engorgement of the central pulmonary vasculature and indistinct pulmonary vascular markings seen peripherally. Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged. Degenerative changes noted at the right shoulder and acromioclavicular joint. Surgical clips seen in the left axilla. Partially visualized abdominal aortic stent.
