Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is likely related to low lung volumes. Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be completely excluded. Small right pleural effusion is identified. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.
