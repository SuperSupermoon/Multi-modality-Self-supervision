There is a large layering left effusion. Bilateral mild to moderate perihilar and pulmonary edema has slightly worsened. The heart remains stably enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered. Mediastinal contours are stable. Right internal jugular Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position with its tip projecting in the proximal right atrium. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax may be diminished as the patient was not imaged in the upright position.
