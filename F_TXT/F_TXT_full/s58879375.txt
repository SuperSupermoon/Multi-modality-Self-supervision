As compared to the previous radiograph, the left chest tube was removed. The left basal chest tube as well as the pigtail catheter on the left are still visible. Of the chest tube removal, there is a minimal linear hyperlucency paralleling the upper aspect 's of the left heart border, potentially reflecting a millimetric pleural air collection or the pneumopericardium. No evidence of tension. No new parenchymal opacities. No larger pleural effusions. Unchanged low lung volumes. No change in position of the right PICC line.
