An endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.4 cm from the carina. An enteric tube tip appears to course below the left diaphragm, off the inferior borders of the film. A left internal jugular vascular sheath is kinked within the level of the neck, and tip is within the region of the low internal jugular vein. Heart size remains moderately enlarged. The lung volumes remain low. Widening of the mediastinum is unchanged, and may reflect low lung volumes with supine AP positioning. Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Atelectasis is seen in the left lung base. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine study. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
