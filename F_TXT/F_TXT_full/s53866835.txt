A right IJ terminates at the caval atrial junction. The endotracheal tube terminates 4.9 cm above the carinal. An orogastric tube is appropriately positioned. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable since the ___ examination, remaining within normal limits. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. A persistent left retrocardiac opacity, likely reflecting atelectasis, is minimally changed over several recent radiographs.
