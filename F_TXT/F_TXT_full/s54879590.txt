In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal. Extensive bilateral pulmonary opacifications are again seen. Although some of this most likely represents elevated pulmonary venous pressure, focal areas of opacification at the right base an the left mid zone are worrisome for superimposed pneumonia. The left hemidiaphragm is poorly seen, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and small pleural effusion.
