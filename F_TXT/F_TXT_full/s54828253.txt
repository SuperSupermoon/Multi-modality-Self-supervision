Comparison is made with prior study, ___. NG tube tip is in the stomach, though the side port is at the GE junction, should be advanced several centimeters for more standard position. There are low lung volumes. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is stable. Right central catheter tip is in the mid SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Increasing left lower lobe opacities are a combination of increasing focal small effusion and adjacent consolidation. This consolidation could be atelectasis and/or infection/pneumonia. The right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
