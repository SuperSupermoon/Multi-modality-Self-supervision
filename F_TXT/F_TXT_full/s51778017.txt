AP chest compared to ___: Re-expansion of the right lung has improved, while the moderate sized right hydrohemothorax has decreased, only a tiny apical and small dependent component. Aeration in the right lower lung is also improving. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Left lung is grossly clear aside from mild vascular re-distribution due to elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective positions. The intended ventricular lead is elevated from the normal location on the floor of the ventricle, and probably apposed to the mid portion of the interventricular septum.
