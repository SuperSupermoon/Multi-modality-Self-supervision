A single AP radiograph of the chest was acquired. The endotracheal tube is low lying, ending 1.2 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly. Lung volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature. There is mild-to-moderate left retrocardiac atelectasis and minimal right lower lung atelectasis. Aspiration pneumonitis at the left lung base is not excluded. The lungs are otherwise clear. There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal allowing for supine technique.
