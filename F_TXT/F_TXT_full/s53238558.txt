Bilateral low lung volumes. Crowding of vessels may be exaggerated by low lung volumes. Cardiac silhouette can be exaggerated by low lung volumes. There is no pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion probable. Consider repeat radiographs with improved inspiratory volumes to evaluate the right lung base.
