Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, a moderate sized partially loculated left pleural effusion has substantially increased in size with associated worsening atelectasis at the left base. A left chest tube remains in place. Intra-aortic balloon pump has apparently been removed. No other relevant changes.
