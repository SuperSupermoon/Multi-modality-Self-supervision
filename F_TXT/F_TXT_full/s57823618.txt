An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.8 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. Right IJ central line tip overlies the mid/distal SVC. A right PICC line overlies the distal-most SVC, near the RA junction. Additional tubing near the left hilum appears to lie outside the patient. Left supraclavicular surgical clip noted. There is mild cardiomegaly, unchanged. A water bottle-type configuration raises the possibility of some pericardial fluid. There are small-to-moderate left and small right pleural effusions, with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and atelectasis at the right base. There is upper zone redistribution, but I doubt overt CHF. Right base granuloma noted. Compared with ___, the effusions are smaller. Vascular plethora has improved. By report, the patient has a pericardial drain in place.
