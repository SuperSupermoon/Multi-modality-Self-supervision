Again seen is cardiomegaly as well as prominence of the superior mediastinum. This appears more pronounced than on the prior examination, but is also accentuated by lordotic positioning. There is upper zone redistribution with alveolar opacities at both lung bases, including retrocardiac opacity that obscures the left hemidiaphragm. A tiny left effusion would be difficult to exclude. The degree of opacity at the right base is very slightly improved.
