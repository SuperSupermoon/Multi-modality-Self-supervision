1. The left lung remains clear. There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. However, on the current examination, there is a suggestion of at least layering pleural fluid on the right, some of which may be subpulmonic. A mass or infection in the right lower lung cannot be excluded. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable with exception of the right heart border which is obscured. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Given the patient's symptoms, further imaging evaluation with CT may be helpful to further elucidate the findings at the right lung base.
