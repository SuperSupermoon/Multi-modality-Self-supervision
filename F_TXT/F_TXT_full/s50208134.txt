Bedside upright AP radiograph of the chest shows interval removal of the endotracheal tube and orogastric tube. The Swan-Ganz catheter has been advanced to further 1 cm and terminates low within the right pulmonary artery. This catheter needs to be withdrawn by at least 5 cm to be appropriately positioned in the right main pulmonary artery. Mild pulmonary edema as well as small bilateral pleural effusions persists, with fluid once again tracking in the minor fissure on the right. The postoperative appearance of the mediastinum and heart are unchanged. Surgical clips, artificial aortic valves, and intact sternal cerclage wires are noted. There is no pneumothorax.
