Compared with the prior study, the left base pleural effusion has decreased in size. There is negligible left pleural fluid visible on this exam. There is patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region and minimal atelectasis at the left base, improved compared with the most recent prior chest x-ray. The opacity at the right base is similar, though the right diaphragm is better visualized, suggesting improvement. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. No pneumothorax is detected.
