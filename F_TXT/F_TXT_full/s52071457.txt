Small bilateral pneumothoraces are less apparent on the current study, possibly due to positional differences of the patient given the recency of the prior exam. Interval intubation with tip of endotracheal tube terminating approximately 6 cm above the carina. New nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach. Persistent cardiomegaly, accompanied by mild interstitial edema and moderate bilateral effusions with adjacent bilateral lower lobe areas of atelectasis and/or consolidation.
