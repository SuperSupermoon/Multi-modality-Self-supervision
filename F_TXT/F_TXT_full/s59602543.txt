Moderate to severe consolidation in the lower lungs has extended superiorly on both sides suggesting the process is more likely dependent edema than pneumonia. Accompanying pleural effusions are small or moderate. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax. Any left subclavian right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead follows the expected course.
