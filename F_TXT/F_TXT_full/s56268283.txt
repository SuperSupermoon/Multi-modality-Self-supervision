One portable semi-erect AP view of the chest. The ET tube ends 3 cm above the carina. NG tube ends in the stomach with last sideport below the GE junction. Right PICC line ends in the mid SVC. Diffuse parenchymal opacities persist and are unchanged. Likely causes are interstitial lung disease, infection, pulmonary edema, or hemorrhage. This is superimposed on chronic fibrotic interstitial lung disease. No definite pleural effusions or pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are stable.
