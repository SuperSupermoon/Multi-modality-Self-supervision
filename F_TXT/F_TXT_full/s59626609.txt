A left pectoral pacemaker is unchanged with a single lead terminating in the right ventricular apex. A tracheostomy tube is in place. There is bi apical capping on the right greater than left, which may represent pleural fluid. A moderate sized layering right pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis is slightly decreased in size. A small left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis is slightly decreased in size. Improved aeration of the bilateral lung bases may also reflect differences in position between studies with more dependent pleural fluid on today's examination. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated. The mediastinal contours are prominent but stable with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and calcification of the aortic knob.
