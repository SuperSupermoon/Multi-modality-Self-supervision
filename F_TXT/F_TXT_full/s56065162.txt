Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Widespread pulmonary opacities, presumably representing pulmonary edema have worsened in the interval, and are accompanied by bilateral moderate pleural effusions. Adjacent basilar lung opacities most likely represent atelectasis. Note is also made of a feeding tube with tip terminating in the stomach, but proximal portion of the tip could potentially be above the GE junction level. This has been a similar position on multiple prior radiographs and could be advanced for standard positioning.
