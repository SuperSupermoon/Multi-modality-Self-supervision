Moderate left pneumothorax slightly larger. Patient is rotated but there is suggestion of rightward mediastinal shift suggesting tension pneumothorax. Lungs are clear. No appreciable pleural effusion. Left subclavian infusion port ends in the low SVC. Subsequent chest radiographs available the time of this review show decompression of the pneumothorax with a left pleural drainage catheter.
