There is persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Slight increase in opacity at the lung bases is felt to most likely be due to overlying soft tissue, which could be confirmed with PA and lateral views. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen. The mediastinal width is normal and not widened. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Hilar contours are within normal limits.
