Slightly rotated positioning. ET tube tip approximately 6.4 cm above the carina, at the level of the inferior edge of the mid medial clavicular heads. NG tube present -- likely extends beneath the diaphragm, but is not well visualized, due to underpenetration and cough of film at this level. Note made of probe overlying the lower left chest --___ may lie outside the the patient. No pneumothorax detected. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There diffusely increased interstitial markings, in keeping with findings on the previous film. The asymmetric increased opacity previously seen in right upper and and adjoining midzone appears less dense on the current examination. However, on the current film, there is focal increased hazy opacity in the right mid and lower zones, with new obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm, which may reflect a pleural effusion. The left costophrenic sulcus is grossly clear.
