Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No large focal consolidation is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is slight blunting of the costophrenic angles which could be due to pleural thickening, hyperinflated lungs, but trace pleural effusions are not excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Multiple old left-sided rib deformities are seen.
