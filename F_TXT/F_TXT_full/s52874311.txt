AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Decrease in pulmonary vascular engorgement represents continued improvement in cardiac function which previously produced remission of pulmonary edema. I am not sure that I can see the questioned pneumonia. There is a small area of increased radiodensity in the right lower lung zone, but this looks more like residual edema and overlying bony structures than pneumonia. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and stigmata of previous mitral valve repair noted.
