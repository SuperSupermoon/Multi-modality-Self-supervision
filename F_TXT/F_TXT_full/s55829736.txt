AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study ___ ___. The patient has a tracheostomy cannula in place, the position of which appears unchanged. Trachea appears unaltered and airways are seen including proximal portion of the main bronchi. There is no evidence of any pneumothorax. There is no sign of significantly increased pulmonary vascular congestion. The right hemithorax shows a normal-appearing lateral pleural sinus without evidence of pleural effusion. Heart size cannot be evaluated in detail because overlying left lower thoracic densities most likely representing pleural effusion and portion of atelectasis. These left-sided basal changes have not undergone any significant interval alteration that can be identified on these limited single-view chest examinations. Considering your diagnostic dilemma, a lateral chest view could be helpful to demonstrate possible pleural effusion accumulating in the posterior dependent pleural sinuses. Although the left lung base densities may include inflammatory pneumonic changes that are not easily detected on a single-view examination. If important for clinical management, consider performance of CT.
