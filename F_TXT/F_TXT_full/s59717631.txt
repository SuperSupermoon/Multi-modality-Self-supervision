AP chest compared to ___: Mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion and basal atelectasis are unchanged. Small right pleural effusion is probably stable as well. No pneumothorax. Heart size normal. Endotracheal tube ends at the thoracic inlet, no less than 6.5 cm from the carina, 5 cm for more secured seating. The nasogastric tube ends in the midline above the level of the carina. It could be in the trachea or in the upper esophagus as pointed out on the report of yesterday's chest radiograph. Since the tube followed much the same course as it does today, when on ___, it passed into the stomach, I presume it is in the esophagus, but I discussed this with the house officer caring for this patient. Left subclavian and right jugular line end in the mid and upper SVC, respectively. There is no pneumothorax. Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at the time of dictation.
