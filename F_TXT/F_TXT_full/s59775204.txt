Low lung volumes are present. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is likely top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no pulmonary edema is seen. Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis, but aspiration cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
