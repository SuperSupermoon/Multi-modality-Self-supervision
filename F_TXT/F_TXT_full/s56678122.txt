An upright portable radiograph of the chest was obtained. The base of the right hemithorax is obscured by an overlying pacemaker. The dual leads extend to the expected positions of the right atrium and ventricle. The patient is status post bilateral shoulder arthroplasties. A left base/retrocardiac opacity may represent consolidation. There may also be a small left pleural effusion. Additionally, there is a superimposed central pulmonary vascular engorgement. The cardiomediastinal contour is enlarged, as on prior exam. There is no pneumothorax.
