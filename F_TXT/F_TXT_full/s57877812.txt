In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, somewhat more prominent on the right. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The overall appearance could well represent a combination of pulmonary edema and, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia. Obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm is consistent with some layering effusion on this side.
