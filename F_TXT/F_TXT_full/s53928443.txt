The size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including widening of the upper mediastinum. There are increasing predominantly perihilar and right lower lobe opacities, possibly reflective of pulmonary edema. Underlying infection cannot be excluded in the proper clinical context. Airspace opacity in the left mid lung zone may correlate to the nodule described on the recent CT scan of the chest. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. No pneumothorax identified.
