Lung volumes are low but slightly improved from the recent study. Unchanged widening of right mediastinal contour, possibly due to vascular engorgement but standard PA and lateral chest x-ray would be helpful prior to discharge to exclude a discrete mediastinal mass. Slight improvement in patchy and linear bibasilar opacities which most likely represent atelectasis, although aspiration and infectious pneumonia are important considerations in the appropriate clinical setting.
