Increased interstitial markings bilaterally is similar in extent as compared to the prior study, likely due to chronic lung disease. No definite acute focal consolidation is seen. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified.
