PA chest compared to ___: Mild increase in diameter of the moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette, mediastinal veins, and new interstitial edema suggest cardiac decompensation, perhaps due to volume overload. Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal. There is no pneumothorax. Expansile lytic lesion of the left fourth rib posterolaterally is not well imaged by this study.
