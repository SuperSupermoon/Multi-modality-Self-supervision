1. A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, although there is a loop above the diaphragm which could represent a coiling within a small hiatal hernia. The tip, however, does pass below the diaphragm and is not visualized on the current study. The tracheostomy tube remains in place. There are bilateral layering effusions which have increased on the right when compared to the prior study. There is perihilar and bilateral airspace interstitial process, this is slightly worsened since the prior study, which suggests that there is at least an element of superimposed pulmonary edema, although diffuse pneumonia or underlying interstitial lung disease cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation is advised. The heart remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to patient rotation. A right fourth posterolateral thoracotomy is seen. No pneumothorax.
