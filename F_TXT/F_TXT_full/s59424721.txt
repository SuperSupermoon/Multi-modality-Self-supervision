A tracheostomy tube is in-situ, unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study. A right-sided subclavian Port-A-Cath is in-situ, the tip terminates in the mid SVC. A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC. A nasogastric tube is in-situ which terminates in the stomach. A Dobhoff tube is in-situ which appears to terminate close to the duodenum jejunal junction. A pigtail catheter is seen projecting over the right lung base. An additional catheter seen in projecting over the right hemidiaphragm, this is likely a perihepatic drain. There is persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. Air bronchograms are noted in the retrocardiac space. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, similar in appearance compared to the prior study and consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion. There is mild cardiomegaly.
