Compared with 1 day earlier, the previously seen dense opacification at the right lung base is no longer visualized. There is some residual, more patchy, right base opacity, probably with air bronchograms. Minimal , if any, residual pleural fluid. Undulating contour of the right hemidiaphragm suggest eventration. No pneumothorax detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains midline. Curvilinear opacity overlies the left neck question bandage or other artifact. Rounded previously seen rounded density along the left mid chest remains faintly visible.
