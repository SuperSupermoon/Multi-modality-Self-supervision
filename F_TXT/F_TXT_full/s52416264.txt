In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the nasogastric tube tip lies in the distal stomach. There are lower lung volumes with increased opacification at the left base most likely reflecting atelectasis and effusion. In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. Pulmonary vessels are less sharply seen, raising the possibility of some increasing pulmonary venous pressure.
