Heart size is prominent but stable. There are airspace opacities throughout both lung fields more confluent at the bases and perihilar regions. This likely represents aspiration or developing pneumonia. The vascular pedicle is not widened thus pulmonary edema is felt to be less likely. Small pleural effusions are seen bilaterally. There are no pneumothoraces.
