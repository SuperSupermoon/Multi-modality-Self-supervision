AP chest compared to ___: New veil-like opacification at the base of the right chest could be pleural effusion, but I suspect new right lower lobe collapse because of mild rightward mediastinal shift. Atelectasis of the left lower lobe is also more pronounced. Upper lungs are clear. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube in standard placement. No pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged.
