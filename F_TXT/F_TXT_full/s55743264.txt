As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has made a substantially lesser respiratory effort. Therefore, vascular and bronchial structures are crowding throughout the lung. As a consequence, it is difficult to determine whether pulmonary edema is present, but the presence of pulmonary edema definitely would be likely. The most current radiograph would be assessed without comparison. Status post CABG, the sternal wires are in correct alignment. No pleural effusions.
