Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Amorphous calcification projecting over the lateral mid chest may be due to calcified pleural plaques. There is also calcification along the left cardiac border, which could be due to pericardial calcification or possibly related to additional pleural plaques. The right lung is clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
