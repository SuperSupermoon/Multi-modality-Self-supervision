There has been interval removal of endotracheal and enteric tubes. Global pulmonary consolidation, left greater than right is grossly stable to possibly mildly increased on the left, as compared to the prior study. Left costophrenic angles obscured in underlying pleural effusion is not excluded versus overlying soft tissue. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. No pneumothorax is seen.
