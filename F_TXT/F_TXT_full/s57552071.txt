Nasogastric drainage tube has been advanced to the distal stomach and previous gastric distention has resolved. Tip of the endotracheal tube at the thoracic inlet is no less than 5 cm from the carina with the chin down. It should be advanced 2 cm for more secure seating. Left PIC line ends in the upper right atrium, at a level 6 cm below the carina and would need to be withdrawn 2 cm to reposition it at the superior cavoatrial junction if desired. Aside from mild right basal atelectasis lungs are clear. Heart size has decreased and mediastinal and pulmonary vascular engorgement have resolved.
