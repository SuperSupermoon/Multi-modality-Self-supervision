In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. Opacification at the right base consistent with atelectasis and effusion again seen. The left hemidiaphragm is less sharply seen, consistent with volume loss and pleural fluid in this region as well. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. No evidence of pneumothorax.
