As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal decrease in lung volumes, likely by a lesser inspiratory effort, with subsequent crowding of vascular structures at the left and right lung bases. No evidence of acute changes such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged right central venous access line.
