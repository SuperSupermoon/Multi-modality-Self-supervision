AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Bronchiectasis and severe emphysema are chronic. There may be very mild pulmonary edema, but I do not see sufficient abnormality to suggest pneumonia. An irregularly-shaped opacity in the lingula, partially obscures the left heart border, present since ___, should be evaluated as possible mass. This examination neither suggests nor excludes the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.
