In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the PICC line is again at the cavoatrial junction. The endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 6 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube coils in the fundus of the stomach before extending to at least the lower body of the stomach. The opacification at the right base has slightly decreased, consistent with some improvement in pleural effusion and volume loss in the lower lobe. On the left, extensive opacification in the retrocardiac region is again consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe with some pleural effusion. Although there is suggestion of possible shift of the mediastinum to the left, much or all of this could be due to obliquity of the patient.
