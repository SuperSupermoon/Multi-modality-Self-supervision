AP chest compared to preoperative chest radiograph on ___: Rows of surgical ___ denote the wedge resection site in the right upper lobe. Upper mediastinum is shifted to the right, and thus is distorted. This suggests the opacification in the right apex is lobar atelectasis, but I am not sure whether it is the upper lobe, more likely, or middle lobe. There is also some component of pleural fluid. Subsequent chest radiograph available at the time of this review shows there was improvement in atelectasis over the next five hours. In the lower lungs are small regions of opacity not present preoperatively which are presumably atelectasis, but should be followed to exclude the development of pneumonia related to aspiration. Right apical pleural tube in place. No pneumothorax. Heart size normal.
