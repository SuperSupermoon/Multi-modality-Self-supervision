As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing left pleural effusion has massively increased in extent. The effusion occupies approximately half of the left hemithorax and causes substantial basal atelectasis. On the right, a small-to-moderate pleural effusion has newly occurred. In the ventilated parts of the lung parenchyma, there is no evidence of pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
