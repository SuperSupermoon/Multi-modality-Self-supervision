A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right jugular central catheter with the tip in the low SVC, an endotracheal tube in proper position, and a nasogastric tube with the tip in the stomach. There is increased pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusions are redemonstrated, the left increased compared to prior radiograph. There is also bibasilar atelectasis left greater than right. Superimposed developing pneumonia cannot be excluded. Additionally, there is a small to moderate right pneumothorax. This pneumothorax is not seen on the prior study secondary to pleural effusion surrounding the upper lobe, but is now evident.
