Right PICC terminates within the right atrium. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in standard position. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Bibasilar atelectasis is accompanied by moderate right and small left pleural effusions. Additional patchy left suprahilar opacity could reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or focal pneumonia. In the absence of older radiographs for comparison, short-term followup radiographs are recommended to exclude a neoplastic process in this region.
