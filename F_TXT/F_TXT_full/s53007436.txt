Extremely low lung volumes are noted. Left-sided central venous catheter tip projects over the upper SVC. There is no visualized pneumothorax. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle could be due to atelectasis or effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.
