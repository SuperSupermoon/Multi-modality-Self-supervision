The lungs are hyperinflated, flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There may be slight upper retraction of the hila likely due to chronic changes at the right greater than left lung apices. No focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is mild to moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. Surgical clips are noted overlying the right lateral lower hemithorax. Multiple left-sided chronic appearing rib deformities are seen which suggest prior fractures.
