The endotracheal tube and bronchial stents are unchanged in position with the tip of the ETT tube just below the level of the clavicular heads. The carina is not able to be clearly seen so an accurate measurement is not possible. Stable appearance to the mediastinum with prominent right paratracheal and bilateral hilar soft tissue consistent with known extensive lymphadenopathy in this patient with an advanced malignancy. There continues to be a large layering right-sided effusion and a smaller layering left effusion. A more rounded opacity at the right lung base likely reflects one of the known pleural metastases. Overall ,when compared to the most recent prior study, there is no significant change. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
