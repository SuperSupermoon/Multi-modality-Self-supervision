In comparison to the prior radiograph obtained two days prior, there has been mild improvement in the aeration of the lower lobes of the lungs, particularly on the left. Bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrates persist, most consistent with ARDS. There is relative sparing of the apices. There is no definite pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is poorly evaluated due to adjacent opacities, although unchanged. The endotracheal tube is 5.3 cm from the carina. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. An NG tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. Cervical hardware is partially imaged.
