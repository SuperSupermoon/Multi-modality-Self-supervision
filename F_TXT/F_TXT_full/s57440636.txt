AP chest compared to ___. Edema has improved only in the right upper lobe. Extensive consolidation elsewhere in both lungs is unchanged, and at least in the left mid lung has the appearance of likely pneumonia. Cardiac silhouette is obscured. Of note, mediastinal venous engorgement is no longer present suggesting there is no elevation of central venous pressure or volume. Dual-channel left jugular and right internal jugular lines both end in the upper SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
