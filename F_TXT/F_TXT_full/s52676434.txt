Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Worsening right middle lobe, right lower lobe opacities and new opacities in the right upper lobe, left perihilar region and left lower lobe are consistent with multifocal aspiration/pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no evident pneumothorax. The small bilateral effusions are probably unchanged.
