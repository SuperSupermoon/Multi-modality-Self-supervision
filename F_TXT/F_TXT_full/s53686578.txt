In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support devices remain in place. The tip of the left subclavian catheter is not well seen on this study, though the configuration suggests that it could still well be within the azygous vein. No definite pneumothorax. There is increasing opacification at the right base, worrisome for developing pneumonia. Some hazy opacification at the bases is consistent with bilateral pleural fluid and some atelectatic change. The area of possible opacification in the left mid zone is difficult to assess on this study due to overlying material.
