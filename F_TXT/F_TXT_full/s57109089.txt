There are persistent bilateral airspace opacities, slightly improved on the left when compared to the prior study. In addition there cystic air spaces and reticular opacities consistent with underlying interstitial lung disease. Lung volumes are unchanged. The left-sided internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC. An endotracheal tube is positioned 1.5 cm above the level the carina and could be withdrawn 2-3 cm. A nasogastric tube terminates below the left hemidiaphragm, the tip is not visualized but the side port is seen to lie in the stomach.
