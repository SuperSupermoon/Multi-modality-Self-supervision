Left subclavian PICC line unchanged in position. Persistent low lung volumes with improved aeration at both bases and decreased ongestion of the perihilar vasculature. These findings would suggest that at least some of the findings on the prior study correlated with pulmonary edema which has now resolved. There is still residual patchy opacity primarily at the left base which may reflect atelectasis. There are likely small layering bilateral effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. The lung apices are partially obscured by an oxygen mask.
