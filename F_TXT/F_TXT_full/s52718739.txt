Single supine portable view of the chest was obtained. There is a right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating in the low SVC without findings to suggest pneumothorax. Relatively low lung volumes. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There is right basilar and right perihilar linear opacities which may be due to atelectasis/scarring. Additionally, there is also linear left basilar opacity, consistent with atelectasis/scarring. There is a chronic deformity of the proximal right humerus, not optimally evaluated on this study.
