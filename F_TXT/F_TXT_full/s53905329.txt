A tracheostomy tube sits at the level of the clavicles. A right IJ central line terminates in the SVC. Evaluation of the lungs is somewhat limited by low lung volumes and motion artifact. However, bilateral airspace opacities have decreased since the study of 5 days ago. Left lung nodules are again noted. Persistent opacification of the retrocardiac region is likely due to atelectasis. There are likely small layering bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is magnified by the projection. There is no pneumothorax.
