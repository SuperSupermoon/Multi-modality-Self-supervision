Left subclavian central venous line terminates in the upper SVC. The study is slightly limited secondary to rotation. Obscuration of left hemidiaphragm and opacification of the retrocardiac region represents persistent left lower lobe collapse. Layering effusion of the left lung in conjunction with known multiple left rib fractures is concerning for growing pneumothorax, although may be due to supine positioning. The right lung is essentially clear with heterogeneous right basilar opacity which may represent atelectasis.
