A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a triple-lumen internal jugular central venous catheter terminating in the right atrium. Obliquity of the patient, slightly lower lung volumes resulting in vascular crowding, and vascular engorgement result in retrocardiac and right lower lung opacities. In the right clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
