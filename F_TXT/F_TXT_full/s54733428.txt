AP chest compared to earlier in the day. Opacification at the periphery of the left hemithorax is probably a fluid collection, conceivably hemothorax, which has collected despite three left pleural drains. There is no pneumothorax. Left lung is largely atelectatic, but the right lung is clear. Heart is top normal size. Patient rotation makes it hard to say whether the new left pleural collection is responsible for rightward mediastinal shift.
