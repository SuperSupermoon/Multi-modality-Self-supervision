Status post median sternotomy. Chest tubes project over both hemithoraces. Low bilateral lung volumes with bibasilar and mid lung atelectasis. No pneumothorax identified. A small amount of pneumomediastinum, likely post operative. The size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged and may be secondary to the low inspiratory lung volumes and post surgical changes.
