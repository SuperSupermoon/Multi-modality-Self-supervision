A single AP radiograph of the chest was obtained. Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not significantly changed. There is pulmonary venous congestion with predominantly perihilar and right lower lung heterogeneous opacities as well as Kerley B lines, most consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Given the slight asymmetry of the opacities at the right lung base, a superimposed infectious process cannot be excluded. There may be a small right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. The mediastinal contours are grossly unchanged.
