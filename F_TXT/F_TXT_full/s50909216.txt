In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is continued evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion, though it appears to be slightly less than on the previous study. The left hemidiaphragm is not well seen, suggesting substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe with pleural effusion. The endotracheal tube remains in an unchanged position. The right IJ sheath has been replaced with a Swan-Ganz catheter that extends to the proximal portion of the right pulmonary artery. The nasogastric tube is difficult to assess, though the tip extends at least into the upper stomach.
