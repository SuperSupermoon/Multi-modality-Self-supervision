As compared to previous radiograph of 2 days earlier, the right hemi thorax is now nearly completely opacified. This appears to be due to a combination of enlarging right pleural effusion and substantial collapse of the right middle and right lower lobes as well as partial atelectasis of the right upper lobe. Other pre-existing findings appear unchanged.
