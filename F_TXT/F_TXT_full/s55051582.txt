Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There has been interval removal of the previously seen left-sided PICC. Mildly increased perihilar opacities suggest mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Subtle opacity at the medial right lung base may be due to atelectasis or focal consolidation. Dedicate PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, with the main pulmonary appearing enlarged, which may be due to pulmonary hypertension. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
