In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 4.4 cm above the carina. There are lower lung volumes, which accentuate the width of the mediastinum and transverse diameter of the heart. Atelectatic changes are seen, especially at the right base. The right central catheter probably extends to the upper portion of the right atrium. There appears to be a left IJ sheath in place.
