The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal. A nasogastric tube tip ends in the gastric fundus. A left subclavian central venous catheter ends in the lower SVC. Discoid right lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged. Heterogeneous opacification of the left lung base, with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, likely represents a combination of a moderate-sized left pleural effusion and left basal consolidation.
