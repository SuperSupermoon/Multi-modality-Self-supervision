Comparison is made with prior study performed three hours earlier. ET tube tip is in standard position, 4.7 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in the stomach. The side port is just distal to the EG junction. Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC, there are no other interval changes allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.
