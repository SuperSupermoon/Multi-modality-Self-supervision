An ET tube is present. The carina is poorly delineated, but the tip probably lies approximately 3.7 cm above the carina. The ET tube tip points toward the right tracheal wall. An NG tube is present and appears to extend beneath the diaphragm and curve, with the tip overlying the gastric fundus. Heart size is borderline versus slightly enlarged. The cardiac silhouette is somewhat globular and a small pericardial effusion would be difficult to exclude. The aortic knob is relatively well-defined. Upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. There is a small left apical pneumothorax. No definite pneumomediastinum. Curvilinear density adjacent to the upper heart/left hilum may be related to some overlying material. There is increased retrocardiac density with air bronchograms consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Hazy density more lateral on left base could represent atelectasis or, less likely, a small amount of layering pleural fluid. There is patchy opacity at the right cardiophrenic region, likely atelectasis. A focus of aspiration is considered less likely. No obvious rib fracture identified on these lung technique films.
