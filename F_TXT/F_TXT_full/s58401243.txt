Interstitial edema has worsened and there is now moderate-to-severe alveolar preliminary edema. There is a more focal zone in right mid lung that could be edema, aspiration or pneumonia. Right lower lung consolidation is obscured by the pulmonary edema. Mild cardiac enlargement and left pectoral atrioventricular pacemaker is unchanged. Small pleural effusion if any. There is no pneumothorax.
