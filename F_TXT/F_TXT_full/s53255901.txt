Right chest tube remains in place with apparent slight increase in size of a small-to-moderate right pneumothorax, best seen laterally. Homogeneous opacity persists in the right upper hemithorax in this patient status post recent right upper lobe resection, and note is again made of a moderate-sized right pleural effusion, partially loculated at the apex. Worsening opacities are also present at both lung bases, and note is made of increasing subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall.
