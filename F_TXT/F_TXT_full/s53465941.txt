In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification at the left base consistent with accumulating pleural fluid, atelectasis, or, in the appropriate clinical setting, even superimposed pneumonia. The left pigtail catheter is again seen, though it appears to be kinked at at least 1 position along its course. The area of opacification in the left mid zone is again seen, though the rounded margin is not as apparent. Again, this area should be followed to exclude a neoplastic process, although CT may eventually be necessary for this purpose.
