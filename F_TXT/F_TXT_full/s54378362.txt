Compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, moderate right and small left pleural effusions are a persistent finding as well as large calcified pleural plaques in the left mid and lower hemi thorax. There remains a suggestion of a possible small lateral left pneumothorax, which could be confirmed or excluded by additional right lateral decubitus view of the left lung if warranted clinically.
