1. Tracheostomy is not as well visualized on the current film as on the prior film, ? due to technical factors. 2. Very thin linear density seen through portions of the mediastinum and also in the upper abdomen, with a radiopaque tip overlying the stomach. Clinical correlation is requested to confirm that this corresponds to the NG or orogastric tube placed. 3. Low inspiratory volumes with bibasilar atelectasis, improved on the right. Air bronchograms seen in the retrocardiac region are consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior film.
