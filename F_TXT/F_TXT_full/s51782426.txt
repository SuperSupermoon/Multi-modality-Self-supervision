Comparison is made to prior radiographs from ___. No definite free air underneath the hemidiaphragms are seen. The study is very limited as the patient's head obscures much of the right lung. Allowing for this, I doubt interval change. There is again seen a right IJ line with distal lead tip in the cavoatrial junction. Minimal prominence of pulmonary interstitial markings without overt pulmonary edema. Spinal hardware is present. The bowel gas pattern is relatively preserved with air in non-dilated loops of small bowel and colon.
