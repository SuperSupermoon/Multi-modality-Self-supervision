Heart size appears at least mild to moderately enlarged, though difficult to assess given the presence of moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. The size of these effusions appears increased compared to the previous exam. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion as well as patchy opacities in the lung bases, most likely bibasilar compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is present. The mediastinal contour is unchanged. No acute osseous abnormality is present.
