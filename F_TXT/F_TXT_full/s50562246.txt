Interval removal of the left chest tube. The right internal jugular central line remains in place and is unchanged in position. There is a tiny left apical pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature and bibasilar opacities favoring atelectasis. There are likely small layering effusions, left greater than right. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours.
