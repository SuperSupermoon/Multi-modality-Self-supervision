Single portable view of the chest. No prior. The lung volumes are seen. There is retrocardiac opacity, which silhouettes the hemidiaphragm, which could be due to atelectasis given low lung volumes, however, component of effusion or consolidation is also possible. Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for technique and low inspiratory effort. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. No free air below the diaphragm.
