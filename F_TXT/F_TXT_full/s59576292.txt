There is a dual lead pacemaker, with lead tips over right atrium right ventricle. The cardiac silhouette is prominent, but similar to prior. Of note, there is marked lucency at the right and left lung apices. While this could represent artifact in a the patient with attenuated vessels/COPD, on the left, the lung edge appears visible. However, the appearances similar to the ___ radiograph and targeted review of the chest CT from ___ is more suggestive of an area of apical pleural thickening with overlying calcification (series 11b: Image ___ from that study). . There is probable background hyperinflation, consistent with COPD., with background parenchymal scarring. Previously seen CHF appears markedly improved. Again seen is a small left effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the prior film. Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle and patchy opacity previously seen at the right lung base medially is improved.
