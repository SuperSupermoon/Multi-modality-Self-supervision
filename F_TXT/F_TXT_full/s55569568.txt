AP chest compared to ___ at 1:56 a.m.: Endotracheal tube cannulates the proximal right main bronchus and should be withdrawn 5.5 cm for standard positioning. Contralateral intubation explains left lower lobe collapse and small left pleural effusion is probably secondary to that. Volume of the right lung is somewhat diminished and there is basal atelectasis, but much less severe than on the left. Right jugular line ends low in the SVC and an upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced 8 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Subsequent chest radiograph, ___ at 9:11 a.m. showed standard repositioning of the endotracheal tube and improvement but not resolution of left lower lobe atelectasis.
