Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard position. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and diffuse interstitial edema. A developing area of consolidation in the left mid and lower lung has rapidly worsened compared to the recent study. Such rapidity suggests the possibility of an acute aspiration event, although differential diagnosis include rapidly progressive infectious pneumonia and less likely asymmetrical pulmonary edema. Moderate-sized left pleural effusion has also increased in the interval.
