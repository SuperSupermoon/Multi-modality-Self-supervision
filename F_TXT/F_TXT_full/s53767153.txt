Since ___, large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, are unchanged with associated atelectasis in the lower lobe. The heart size is normal. Right and left central lines are seen with tips in the distal SVC. The endotracheal tube is seen with the tip seen 2.7 cm above the carina. The feeding tube is seen heading in the direction of the stomach but is largely obscured distally due to film under-penetration.
