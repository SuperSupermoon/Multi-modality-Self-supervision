Lung volumes are very low. Patchy infiltrates in the right and left upper lung are mostly unchanged from the prior study. These findings correlate to the multifocal ground-glass opacities seen on CT chest from two days prior, likely multifocal pneumonia or hemorrhage. A right internal jugular line is seen in the distal SVC, unchanged. NG tube has been removed. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
