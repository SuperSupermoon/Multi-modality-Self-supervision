In comparison to the prior exam, there is a marked increase in hazy bilateral opacities extending from the perihilar area, compatible with diffuse pulmonary edema. There is retraction of the major fissure on the right upward compatible with some volume loss in the right upper lobe. No pleural effusions are noted. The heart size is mildly enlarged. The patient is status post median sternotomy as well as CABG and pacemaker-type device with leads terminating in the appropriate positions.
