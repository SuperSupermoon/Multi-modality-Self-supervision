Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent opacification at the right lung base, likely a combination of pleural effusion and pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the upper SVC. A large bore left internal jugular central venous line ends in the distal SVC.
