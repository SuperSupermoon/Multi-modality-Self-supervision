Comparison is made with prior study performed 10 hours earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. ET tube tip is in standard position, 5.2 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is seen in the stomach. New right lower lobe opacity is consistent with aspiration. Left lower lobe opacity could be due to atelectasis and/or aspiration. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.
