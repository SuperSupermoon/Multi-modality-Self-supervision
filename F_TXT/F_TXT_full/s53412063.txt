Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. A left IJ tunneled dialysis catheter is again noted with its tip residing in the expected location of the right atrium. Lung volumes are low. Previously noted right PICC line has been removed. Given the low lung volumes, evaluation of the lung bases is limited. There is linear opacity in the left retrocardiac space, likely representing atelectasis. No definite signs of pneumonia or CHF. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size cannot be readily assessed. Mediastinal contour appears stable with atherosclerotic calcifications along the aortic knob. Bony structures are intact.
