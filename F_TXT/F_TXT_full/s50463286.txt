The NG tube appears to have been advanced slightly compared with the prior film and is now curled in the fundus. The NG tube and sideport as overlie the gastric fundus. Because the distal portion of the tube is curved, the tip points toward the region of the GE junction, The lung apices are excluded from the film, which he is centered at the diaphragms to better depict the NG tube. Allowing for this, the ET tube has been removed. Otherwise, I doubt significant change. Again seen is a left-sided central line with tip over distal SVC; prominent platelike atelectasis at the right lung base with? trace right effusion; can a small left effusion, with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Skin ___ over the upper abdomen near the midline can residual oral contrast in the left splenic flexure are also again noted.
