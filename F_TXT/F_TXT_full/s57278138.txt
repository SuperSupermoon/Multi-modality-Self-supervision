The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Patchy, linear bibasilar opacities most likely represent atelectasis. An endotracheal tube is noted, terminating approximately 6 cm above the carina. Enteric tube passes below the inferior field of view. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. Chronic deformity of the left clavicle suggests prior fracture. Old healed left posterior rib fractures are also seen.
