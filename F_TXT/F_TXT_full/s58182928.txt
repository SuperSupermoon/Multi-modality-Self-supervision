AP chest compared to ___, 11:27 a.m.: The moderate left pleural effusion was probably present on ___ also. Since there is ipsilateral shift of the lower mediastinum, I suspect it is chronic, and associated with volume loss in the left lower lobe. Mild interstitial abnormality is present at the base of the right lung and there is vascular distortion suggesting emphysema. At the very least conventional chest radiographs should be obtained when feasible and it may be necessary to obtain either prior chest imaging or CT scan to elucidate the findings in the left hemithorax. Heart size is difficult to assess because of adjacent pleural abnormalities, but if there is cardiomegaly it is not severe and there are no vascular findings to suggest cardiac decompensation.
