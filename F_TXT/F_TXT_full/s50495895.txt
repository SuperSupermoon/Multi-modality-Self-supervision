The patient has been intubated with endotracheal tube tip terminating about 9.5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube coils in the stomach with associated decrease in gastric distention since prior study. Persistent airspace consolidation in the left perihilar and basilar regions is consistent with known pneumonia, accompanied by moderate left pleural effusion. Previously demonstrated horizontal interface appears slightly less distinct, but this may reflect the lack of upright positioning. As reported previously, this finding raises the concern for loculated hydropneumothorax. Right lung and pleural surfaces remain clear.
