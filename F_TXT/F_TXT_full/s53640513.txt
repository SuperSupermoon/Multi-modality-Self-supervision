The heart is enlarged. The hilar and mediastinal contours are somewhat obscured by hazy patchy opacities which extend across both lungs, predominantly at the bases. The central pulmonary vessels are engorged and hazy. This constellation of findings is most compatible with moderate-to-severe interstitial edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present. There is no pneumothorax.
