AP chest compared to ___: Lungs are substantially lower today with moderately severe left and mild right basal atelectasis. Very low lung volumes make it difficult to determine whether there is only vascular crowding or real vascular engorgement. The heart is not particularly enlarged, its size exaggerated by low lung volumes. Very poor definition of the airway in both main bronchi raises concern for severe retention of secretions. Small left pleural effusion is presumed. A left subclavian infusion port ends low in the SVC. No pneumothorax. Upper enteric drainage tube ends at the level of the larynx or hypopharynx. Dr. ___ was paged at 9:50 a.m., one minute after the findings were recognized.
