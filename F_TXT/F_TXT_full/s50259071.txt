Semi-upright portable AP view of the chest was provided. The endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing approximately 5.9 cm above the carina. The NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen. Layering bilateral pleural effusions are noted with lower lobe consolidation, likely atelectasis, though cannot exclude pneumonia/aspiration. The upper lungs appear well aerated. Heart size is difficult to assess. The mediastinal contour is unremarkable. There is a deformity of the left distal clavicle, which is incompletely characterized.
