Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. There is a relatively focal patchy opacity projecting over the right upper lung. Additionally, there is a patchy opacity projecting over the right lung apex. The left lung is grossly clear. The cardiac silhouette is top normal with possible mitral annulus calcification. The aortic knob is calcified. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant are presumed from prior cholecystectomy.
