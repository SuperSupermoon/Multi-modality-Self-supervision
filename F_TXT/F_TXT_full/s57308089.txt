Status post CABG, the sternotomy wires and clips are in expected position. The left pectoral pacemaker is seen, the position of the pacemaker leads is correct, in the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. The only abnormality, at relatively low lung volumes, is tortuosity of the thoracic aorta as well as a minimal blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by minimal right pleural effusion. There is no acute abnormality, notably no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
