As compared to the previous radiograph, there is evidence of increasing atelectasis at the left lung base. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small pleural effusion. On the right, there is no relevant change. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly with minimal fluid overload.
