In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Relatively low lung volumes with the cardiac silhouette to be mildly enlarged. No definite vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. There may be some atelectatic changes at the left base, though this is difficult to assess due to the extensive scattered radiation related to the size of the patient. Nasogastric and endotracheal tubes are essentially unchanged.
