AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 5:43: Persistent consolidation at the base of the left lung, after return of the mediastinum to the midline is certainly consistent with pneumonia developing in the region of prior atelectasis. Left apical pleural tube unchanged in position. Left pleural effusion is small. No pneumothorax. No endotracheal tube is seen below C6, the upper margin of this examination. An upper enteric drainage tube ends in the distal stomach and a feeding tube passes into the duodenum and out of view. Upper abdominal drains still in place. Right lung low in volume, clear of both diaphragms. Small right pleural effusion may be present. Cardiac silhouette is exaggerated by low lung volumes, but is slightly larger than would be expected for a patient of this age suggesting volume overload reflected in esophagus distention. There is no pulmonary edema. Right PIC line ends in the right atrium.
