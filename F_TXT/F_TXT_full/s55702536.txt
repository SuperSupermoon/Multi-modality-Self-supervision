Again seen is the single lead left-sided pacemaker, lead tip over right ventricle. Inspiratory volumes are low. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There may be minimal upper zone redistribution and slight vascular plethora, but I doubt other evidence of CHF. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is also again noted. A small right effusion is likely present.
