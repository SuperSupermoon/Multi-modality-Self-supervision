As compared to the previous image, no relevant change is seen. The alignment of the sternal wires and the course of the pacemaker wires is constant. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Mild elongation of the descending aorta. No pulmonary edema. The left PICC line is difficult to evaluate, given that it parallels the radiodense pacemaker leads. No pneumothorax.
