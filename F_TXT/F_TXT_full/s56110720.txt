The left upper lobe alveolar opacities are better today. They were compatible with contusion. Stability of the mild apical and axillary left pleural effusion. There is no visible pneumothorax. The left lower lobe atelectasis is still present; however, there seems to be a slight left mediastinal shift since the previous exam, possibly because of the rotation of the patient, but a progression of the atelectasis can also be considered. The radiolucencies that were adjacent to the left cardiac border are better: they are possibly compatible with laceration. The right lung is normal. Stability of the undisplaced left scapular fracture.
