A nasoenteric feeding tube is seen passing through the esophagus into the distal stomach and out of the field-of-view. There is pulmonary vascular congestion with mild pulmonary edema. There is a left retrocardiac opacity, which may represent atelectasis with superimposed pneumonia. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly exaggerated by patient positioning and technique. Cholecystectomy clips are seen in the right upper quadrant.
