There is a patchy retrocardiac opacity with a suggestion of air bronchograms concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. In addition, there is patchy heterogeneous opacity along the medial left upper lung also concerning for aspiration, less likely atelectasis. The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated with patchy opacity at the base suggestive of atelectasis given the low lung volumes. Probable layering left effusion. No pulmonary edema. Heart is stably enlarged with a left ventricular prominence. No pneumothorax. Clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior cholecystectomy.
