Portable semi-upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates improvement in aeration of the right lung base. The left basal opacification is unchanged, as is a moderate left pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged, the mediastinal contours are unchanged but are notable for central venous engorgement. There is no pneumothorax. A nasogastric tube is in place, the tip is not seen though it does pass below the diaphragm.
