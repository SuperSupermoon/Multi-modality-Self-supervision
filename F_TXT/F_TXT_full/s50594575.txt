In comparison to the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, the endotracheal tube tip now is at the level of the carina with the neck in a flexed position. This could be withdrawn a few cm for standard positioning. Orogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm with tip beyond the field of view. Cardiomegaly is accompanied by worsening pulmonary edema and apparently new small left pleural effusion. Moderate gastric distension is present in the upper abdomen.
