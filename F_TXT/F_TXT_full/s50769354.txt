The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Moderate to severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged, with a slightly globular configuration. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Patchy opacities in the lung bases are not substantially changed in the interval, potentially atelectasis, but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
