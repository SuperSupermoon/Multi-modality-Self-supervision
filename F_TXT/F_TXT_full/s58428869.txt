The newly placed a left IJ approach central venous catheter tip projects over the expected region of the cavoatrial junction. A left single lead pacer defibrillator tip projects over the expected region of the right atrium. Cardiac valve replacement, median sternotomy wires, and mediastinal clips are unchanged. Lung volumes remain low. Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally suggests small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax or frank pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
