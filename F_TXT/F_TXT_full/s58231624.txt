The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant bronchovascular crowding and accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. There are bibasilar opacities and blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggesting small bilateral pleural effusions with underlying atelectasis or consolidation. No significant pneumothorax is detected on this single semi-erect view. There is no free air beneath the diaphragm. S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis is noted.
