Since a recent radiograph of earlier today, a left pleural catheter has been placed, with resolution of left pleural effusion and adjacent basilar atelectasis. A tiny left basilar pneumothorax is evident. Right pleural catheter is unchanged with persistent small right pleural effusion and adjacent worsening right basilar atelectasis. Cardiomegaly is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and improving pulmonary edema.
