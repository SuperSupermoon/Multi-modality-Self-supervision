A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. Compared to the prior study, there is no change. Linear opacities at the lung bases are atelectasis. The epidural catheter and right chest tube are unchanged in position. No pneumothorax or substantial pleural effusion. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
