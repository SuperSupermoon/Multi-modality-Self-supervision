ET tube lies approximately 3.6 cm above the carina. NG tube present, tip over fundus. A left subclavian central line tip overlies proximal SVC. No pneumothorax identified. Again seen is cardiomegaly, similar to prior. Again seen is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring. This appears improved compared with ___ and areas of more confluent opacity at the right lung base of improved considerably. No gross right effusion. Again seenis increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, overall similar to the prior study. Small left effusion cannot be excluded.
