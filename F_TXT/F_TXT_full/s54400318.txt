Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates ET tube terminating 2.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is positioned in the stomach. Low lung volumes. Retrocardiac opacity obscures the left hemidiaphragm. Right lung base opacity is also noted. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is normal. There is no pulmonary edema. Partially imaged upper abdomen is notable for air-filled prominent stomach and bowel loops.
