The ET tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the carina. Although there is a generalized increase in radiodensity in the right lung, which could be secondary to edema, increased opacification at the right lung apex at the site of prior radiation injury, may be secondary to pneumonia. Diffuse interstitial abnormality, particularly within the right upper lobe is compatible with patient's known lymphangitic spread of cancer as seen on the prior chest CT examination, and overall appears slightly worse compared to the prior exam. Mild left basilar atelectasis is persistent. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable. There is no evidence of a pneumothorax. The heart size is normal.
