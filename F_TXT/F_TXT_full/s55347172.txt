CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. A right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is present, tip overlying proximal right pulmonary artery, similar vs ? slightly more distal, compared with ___. No pneumothorax is detected. The CHF findings are similar, possibly slightly improved. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
