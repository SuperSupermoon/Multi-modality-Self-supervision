The lungs are well expanded. The opacity in the medial right lung base is decreased slightly in conspicuity in the interval, consistent with resolving abscess. A small area of consolidation is again seen in the left mid lung, unchanged from prior exam. No pleural effusions are smaller than on prior exam. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable from prior exam. Endobronchial bowel is again noted in the right lung.
