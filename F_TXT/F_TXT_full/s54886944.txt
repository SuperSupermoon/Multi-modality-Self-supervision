As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5.3 cm above the carina. The patient also has a nasogastric tube, the course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not included on the image. Newly occurred is a right lower lobe atelectasis with relatively extensive air bronchograms. A preexisting left basal parenchymal opacity appears less extensive than on the previous image, likely caused by the increased ventilatory pressure. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema and no evidence of larger pleural effusions.
