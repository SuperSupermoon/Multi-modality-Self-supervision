Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.6 cm from the carina. Heart size is borderline enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unremarkable. Low lung volumes are present which results in crowding of bronchovascular structures, but no pulmonary edema is seen. Patchy opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute osseous abnormalities detected.
