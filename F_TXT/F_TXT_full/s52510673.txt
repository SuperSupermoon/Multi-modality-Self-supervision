Comparison is made with prior study performed a day before. Right upper lobe opacity has increased concerning for increasing pneumonia/aspiration. There is also increase in opacities in the left lower lobe, consistent with aspiration. Other multifocal consolidations in the left upper lobe, right perihilar region, and right lower lobe are unchanged. Large right lower lobe fluid collection is unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Lines, tubes, and stent are in unchanged standard positions.
