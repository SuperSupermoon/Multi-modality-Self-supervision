Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval insertion of a Dobbhoff tube which is coiled within in the stomach and then turns back to terminate in the esophagus at the level of the clavicles. There is a left-sided PICC line with tip terminating in the mid SVC. There are multifocal opacifications, worst in the lung bases, which may represent atelectasis, though infectious process is consideration, possibly aspiration. Dense opacification projecting over the right mid lung corresponds to a loculated fissural effusion evident on the prior CT.
