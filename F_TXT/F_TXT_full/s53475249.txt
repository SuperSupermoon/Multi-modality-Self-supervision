Examination is suboptimal given patient positioning. The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. There is prominent pulmonary vasculature in comparison to the most recent prior. In addition, a new vague opacity is seen in the right lung base, which may represent atelectasis, although infiltrate is not entirely excluded. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
