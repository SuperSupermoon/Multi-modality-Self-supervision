Low lung volumes resulting crowding of the bronchovascular structures. There is no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits with mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Prominence to the right extra-thoracic soft tissues is likely due to hematoma as seen on the concomitant CT. Known small right pleural effusion is seen to better detail on that study.
