Patchy lingular opacity is seen which could be due to atelectasis versus infectious process in the appropriate clinical setting. Perihilar peribronchial thickening is noted. The right lung is clear. The lungs are relatively hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
