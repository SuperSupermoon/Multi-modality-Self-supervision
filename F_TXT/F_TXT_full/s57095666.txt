Apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely related to lower lung volumes and technique. Mediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable. Lungs are clear. Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. There is no large effusion. No discrete pneumothorax is appreciated. Right chest tube is no longer seen.
