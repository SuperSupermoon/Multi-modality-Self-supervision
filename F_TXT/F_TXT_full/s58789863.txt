Interval repositioning of left intra-aortic balloon pump, with tip now terminating 3.8 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. Swan-Ganz catheter terminates within the right hilar region, likely in the distal interlobar pulmonary artery. This could be withdrawn a few centimeters for standard positioning. Other indwelling devices are in standard position. Stable cardiomegaly, accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate edema with a mid and lower lung predominance in this patient with known upper lobe predominant emphysema. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are present, with interval increase in size on the left.
