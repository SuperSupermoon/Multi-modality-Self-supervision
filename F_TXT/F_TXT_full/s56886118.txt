AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained two hours earlier during the same day. During the examination interval the previously remaining right internal jugular approach sheath has been removed. The right-sided moderately sized pneumothorax in the apical area remains rather unchanged. Also the left sided very small apical pneumothorax separation can again be identified and also appears unchanged. No other significant interval changes are seen.
