Following extubation, lung volumes are relatively unchanged overall but greater opacification in the lower lobes could be atelectasis or pneumonia, and some coalescence of new mild pulmonary edema. Moderate right pleural effusion is probably larger. A drainage tube in the right diaphragmatic region cannot be localized ; it could be pleural. Moderate cardiomegaly is increased. No pneumothorax. .
