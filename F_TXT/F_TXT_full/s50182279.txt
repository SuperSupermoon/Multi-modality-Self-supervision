Comparison is made to the prior radiographs from ___. There are again seen diffuse bilateral interstitial densities, which can be seen with pneumonia. There is likely also an element of pulmonary edema, however, the vascular pedicle is not widened, thus an infectious etiology is more likely. There is a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. The tip is better assessed on the prior radiograph. There are no pneumothoraces. Overall, these findings appear stable.
