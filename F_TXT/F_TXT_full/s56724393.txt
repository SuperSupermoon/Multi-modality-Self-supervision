A right-sided subclavian central venous catheter is present, terminating at the cavoatrial junction. A left-sided subclavian central venous catheter is present, terminating in the lower SVC. The cardiac mediastinal silhouettes appear unchanged in within normal limits. There is slightly increased opacity seen in the left base in the retrocardiac region, likely representing atelectasis, without a definite consolidative process. Overall lung markings appear slightly increased when compared to the prior examination, although very similar in appearance is when compared to the examination from 2 days previous. This is likely due to differences in penetration.
