As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged scoliosis with subsequent asymmetry of the rib cage. The pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting atelectasis as a consequence of the bilateral pleural effusions, are constant in extent. There is no new parenchymal abnormality. Minimal fluid overload. No pneumothorax. The right PICC line is in unchanged position.
