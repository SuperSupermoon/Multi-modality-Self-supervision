A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Surgical clips in the right upper lobe with an associated predominately linear opacity are again seen likely reflecting postoperative changes with scarring. A left hilar clip was also again seen. Increasing areas of patchy opacity in both lung bases more likely reflect atelectasis, although an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. Clinical correlation is recommended. No large effusions. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
