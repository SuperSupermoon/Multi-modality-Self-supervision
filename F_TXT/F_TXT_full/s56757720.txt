Lung volumes are low. Heart size remains mildly enlarged but not substantially changed in the interval. Slight widening of the superior mediastinum is felt to be due to low lung volumes. Aortic knob remains distinct. Patient is status post bilateral mastectomies and breast implants. New hazy opacifications are seen within the left lung with sparing of the left apex and left costophrenic angle, as well as the right mid and lower lung fields. It is unclear if these reflect true parenchymal abnormalities or the presence of the breast implants. Pulmonary vasculature does not appear engorged. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is identified.
