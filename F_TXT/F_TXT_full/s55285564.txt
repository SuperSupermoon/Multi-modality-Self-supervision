Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. Of note this examination was centered in the thoracoabdominal region to evaluate position of NG tube. The tip is in the duodenum, the second portion. Findings in the chest are unchanged, better evaluated in the prior study. Dilatation of bowel loops in the upper abdomen are again noted.
