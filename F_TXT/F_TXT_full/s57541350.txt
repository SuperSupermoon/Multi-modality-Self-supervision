Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has resolved and there is no edema. Pleural effusions are small with any. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Indentation in the right side of the lower cervical trachea could be due to a tortuous innominate artery or enlarged right thyroid lobe. Left subclavian line ends at the origin of the SVC. No pneumothorax. Biapical pleural thickening is symmetric, smooth, usually due to fatty deposition.
