Cervical and lumbar spinal hardware is visualized. The ET tube tip is 4.8 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are low. There is minimal pulmonary vascular redistribution but no overt pulmonary edema. There is crowding at the left base which could be due to volume loss or an early infiltrate. Volume loss is also present at the right base.
