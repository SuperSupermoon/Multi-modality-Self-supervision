The lungs appear hyperinflated with flattening of the hemidiaphragms consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are however increased densities in the right upper lobe and bilateral lower lobes suggestive of an active infectious process overlying a chronic fibrotic process. The esophagus is distended. The aorta remains tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is normal. No acute fractures are noted.
