The stent is difficult to see, though the tip appears to be in the lower portion of the trachea just above the carina. There are extremely low lung volumes with extensive atelectatic changes in the right mid zone. Retrocardiac atelectasis is also seen. The apparent increase in the transverse diameter of the heart most likely reflects the low lung volumes.
