Right internal jugular central venous catheter is new, terminating in the proximal right atrium. No large pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. There are low lung volumes with patchy bibasilar opacities likely reflective of atelectasis. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are otherwise unchanged allowing for patient rotation. Assessment of the left apex is limited as it is obscured by the patient's chin and neck soft tissues. No large pleural effusion is demonstrated.
