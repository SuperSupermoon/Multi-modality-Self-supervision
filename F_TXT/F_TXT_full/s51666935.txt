Lung volumes have improved and vascular congestion has decreased since ___. There is no pulmonary edema. There is increased peribronchial opacification in the right lower lobe. Whether this is atelectasis or pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate. Similar abnormality at the left lung base is more typical of atelectasis which has been present since ___. Small pleural effusions are presumed, but no larger today and there is no pneumothorax. Mild to moderate cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular widening are stable since ___. I doubt that this represents acute cardiac decompensation or substantial volume overload. Longer than standard tracheostomy tube is unchanged in midline position. Right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC. Transvenous right atrial right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective positions, including possibility that the intended atrial lead loops in the tricuspid valve.
