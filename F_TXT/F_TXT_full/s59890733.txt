As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared extensive parenchymal opacity occupying half of the left upper hemithorax. The opacity likely is related to the aspiration event. The lung volumes have decreased. There is evidence of mild fluid overload and moderate cardiomegaly. Larger pleural effusions are not seen. No pneumothorax.
