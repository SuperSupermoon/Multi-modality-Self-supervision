AP chest compared to ___: Pulmonary vascular engorgement has worsened since ___, and mild edema may be present at the right lung base. Volume loss and consolidation in the left lower lobe are longstanding. Smaller focus of possible pneumonia at the right base is stable since at least ___, but there is new opacification surrounding the right hilus. If this is not asymmetric edema, it is conceivably pneumonia in the superior segment of the right lower lobe. Moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette is chronic. Mediastinal widening due to a severe adenopathy also longstanding. ET tube in standard placement, nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Left jugular line ends at the origin of the SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Left pleural effusion small to moderate, unchanged. Right pleural effusion probably small, but stable.
