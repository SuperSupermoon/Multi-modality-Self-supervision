As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal tube is not substantially changed in position, 8 projects 4.5 cm above the carinal. The course of the nasogastric tube is constant. The tip of the left internal jugular vein catheter points upwards, instead of downwards, a position that should be monitored on the followup images and potentially corrected. Unchanged mild pulmonary edema, stable since the previous examination, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions and areas of atelectasis. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
