Single supine view of the chest. Low lung volumes are noted. There are streaky bibasilar opacities, potentially due to atelectasis. There is crowding of the bronchovascular markings noting that there is also possible superimposed vascular congestion. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but not significantly changed given differences in positioning and technique. Excreted contrast is seen in the kidneys bilaterally.
