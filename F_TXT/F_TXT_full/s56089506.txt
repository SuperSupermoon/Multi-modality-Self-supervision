With the chin down, tip of the ET tube less than 2 cm from the carina is in optimal position. There has been some improvement in the severe, infiltrative abnormality which spread to the right lung earlier in the day, and in the more severe, generalized involvement of the left lung which is been present for several days. The interval improvement the suggests a component of edema, volume related or otherwise, but the developments today in the right lung suggest spreading infection or pulmonary hemorrhage is also present. Pleural effusion is presumed, but not large. No pneumothorax. Lung volumes remain quite small, due in part to intestinal distention.
