Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Currently, the ET tube tip is high, right above the clavicular heads, 5.6 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. The NG tube tip terminates too proximally just at the gastroesophageal junction and should be further advanced. Bibasal consolidations are re-demonstrated, with an impression of interval increase in pleural effusions. Mild vascular engorgement is unchanged. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
