Severe cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries is compatible with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. Mild pulmonary edema is worse compared to the previous exam. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present. Retrocardiac consolidative opacity may reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded. No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
