AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Feeding tube with a wire stylet in place ends in the upper esophagus. ET tube, left subclavian and right internal jugular catheters in standard placements. Lung volumes are quite low, exaggerating the severity of mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis. Bilateral pleural effusions are small to moderate. Heart size normal. Very large calcified mitral annulus could be responsible for mitral regurgitation. Subsequent chest radiograph showed repositioning of standard upper enteric drainage catheter and removal of the errant feeding tube.
