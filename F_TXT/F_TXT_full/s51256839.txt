Portable chest radiograph demonstrates a mildly improved lung volumes with redemonstration of diffuse bilateral opacifications most consistent with pulmonary edema and could well represent an element of multifocal pneumona. When compared to most recent radiograph, there has not been a substantial change in severeity of those bilateral opacifications or pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size is stable.
