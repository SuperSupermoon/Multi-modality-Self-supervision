Moderate-to-large bilateral layering pleural effusions are improved from prior study with decrease in size of the cardiac silhouette and decreased engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature. Associated bibasilar atelectasis is improved. A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid to low SVC, as does a left subclavian central venous catheter. An upper enteric tube is in place with the tip out of view; however, is coiled proximally in the hypopharynx. There is no pneumothorax.
