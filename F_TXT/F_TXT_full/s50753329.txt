Endotracheal tube tip is 4.2 cm from the carina. Enteric tube seen taking an unusual course through the lower mediastinum and passes below the inferior field of view. This is likely due to a large hiatal hernia, which would explain the right basilar and retrocardiac rounded opacity. Low lung volumes are seen with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings. Where seen, the lungs are grossly clear. Surgical clips project over the left axilla and chest wall.
