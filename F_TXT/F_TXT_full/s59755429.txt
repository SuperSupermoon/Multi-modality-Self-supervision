Endotracheal tube terminates 5.8 cm above the carina. The lungs are hyperinflated, reflecting a combination of intubation and chronic lung disease. A linear opacity at the right lung apex is thought to reflect overlying structures, rather than pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion or focal airspace consolidation. Linear atelectasis is seen at the left lung base. Heart is normal size. The mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable. Old left-sided rib fractures are noted. The stomach is distended with air.
