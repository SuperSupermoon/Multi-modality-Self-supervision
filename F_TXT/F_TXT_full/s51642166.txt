Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Post-sternotomy wires are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions are noted. Subcutaneous air is new in the left upper chest wall, but no clear pneumothorax is seen, attention to this area on the subsequent studies is required. Note is made of the lucency along the left mediastinal border that might reflect pneumothorax.
