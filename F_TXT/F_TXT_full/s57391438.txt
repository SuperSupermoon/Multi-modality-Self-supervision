AP chest compared to ___ and ___: Right hilus has enlarged and a region of infrahilar opacity, perhaps consolidation has coalesced since ___. There is also new atelectasis at the left lung base and greater distention of mediastinal veins. The presumption is new pneumonia or pulmonary embolus with infarction in the right lower lobe, and possible bronchospasm responsible for the atelectasis on the left. In the setting of mild cardiomegaly, cardiac decompensation may be contributory. Findings reported after review of subsequent chest radiograph reported separately, performed at 6:48 a.m.
