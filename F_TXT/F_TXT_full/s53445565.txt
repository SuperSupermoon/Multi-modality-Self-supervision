ET tube tip 5.9 cm above the carina. Right PICC line tip over mid/ distal SVC. The NG type tube is no longer visualized. No pneumothorax detected. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Vascular plethora, hazy opacity in the right mid and lower zones, and increased retrocardiac density are also similar to the prior study.
