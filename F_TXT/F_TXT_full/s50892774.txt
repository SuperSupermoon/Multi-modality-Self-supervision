AP chest compared to ___: ET tube is in standard placement. Upper enteric drainage tube ends at the gastroesophageal junction and would need to be advanced 15 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach. Right lung is fully airless, a combination of new upper lobe collapse and previous atelectasis due to right pleural effusion and replacement by right lung and lower lobe mass. Large mass in the left lung is unchanged. There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart borders are entirely obscured by pleural and parenchymal abnormalities. No pneumothorax.
