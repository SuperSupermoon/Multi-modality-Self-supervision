Lung volumes are low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. Again seen is a large right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis, which appears similar to to prior. Right upper lung and left lung are grossly clear. The heart is top-normal in size. There is no pneumothorax. The left upper extremity PICC has been removed over the interval.
