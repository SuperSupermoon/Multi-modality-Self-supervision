There is stable mild cardiomegaly. The hilar and mediastinal contours are stable, with moderate aortic calcification. Mild pulmonary edema is slightly worse since the earlier study done today at 11:52 a.m. There is increasing consolidation in the right lung base, consistent with pneumonia. Streaky opacities in the left lung base, likely represent atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. A left chest wall AICD device is seen with leads in expected position in the right atrium and right ventricle.
