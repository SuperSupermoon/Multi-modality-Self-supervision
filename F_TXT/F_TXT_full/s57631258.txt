Interval repositioning of endotracheal tube, now in standard position. Other support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Interval improvement in asymmetrically distributed air space opacities affecting the right lung to a greater degree than the left, and most likely representing asymmetrical pulmonary edema. A more confluent opacity in the left retrocardiac area has worsened, however, and probably represents a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion, although coexisting aspiration or infectious pneumonia are possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Small right pleural effusion is also noted.
