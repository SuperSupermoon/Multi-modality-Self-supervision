Portable semi-upright chest radiograph demonstrates no significant change in bibasilar opacities likely reflecting a combination of atelectasis and effusion, though left lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded. The cardiac silhouette is notable for early postoperative enlargement, unchanged. Median sternotomy wires and post-surgical changes of CABG are again noted. A right IJ central venous catheter tip is unchanged in position. Pulmonary vasculature is normal.
