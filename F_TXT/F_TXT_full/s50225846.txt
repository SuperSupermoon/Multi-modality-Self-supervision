Supine portable AP view the chest. An endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located 4.3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube descends down the thoracic midline with its tip just beyond the GE junction. Advancement would result in more optimal positioning. The heart appears enlarged though this in part reflect supine AP technique. There is hilar congestion and mild pulmonary edema. No supine evidence for large effusion or pneumothorax. Mediastinal contour appears grossly unremarkable. Bony structures appear intact.
