Single portable chest radiograph was provided. The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned in the upper trachea. Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, but is incompletely imaged. A right internal jugular central line terminates in the SVC. Left chest wall pacemaker is present with leads likely in the right atrium and ventricle. Pleural thickening is similar to the previous exam. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, are also similar. Pathcy parenchymal opacities are most consistent with pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
