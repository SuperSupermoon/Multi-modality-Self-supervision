Portable AP upright radiograph was obtained. The lungs are somewhat low in volume with increased left basal opacity which may reflect atelectasis given the low lung volumes, though component of aspiration or pneumonia could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. No pleural effusion is seen. Heart size is top normal with normal cardiomediastinal contours. Diffuse sclerosis of the osseous structures is compatible with metastases.
