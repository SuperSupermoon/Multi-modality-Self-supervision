Endotracheal and enteric tubes remain in unchanged positions. There has been interval placement of a left basilar chest tube. There is continued near complete opacification of the left hemi thorax with probable leftward shift of mediastinal structures suggestive of atelectasis/collapse. Patchy opacity in the right lung base also likely reflects an area of atelectasis. No overt pulmonary edema or large pneumothorax is present. Known fractures of the right anterior ribs are not well assessed on the current radiograph
