Since prior, there has been interval placement of right-sided pleural catheter with subsequent reduction in the size of the moderate to large right pleural effusion. There is loculated pneumothorax over the right lung base laterally. Some opacity at the right lung base medially could represent combination of residual fluid and/or atelectasis. Left lung is grossly clear. Left chest wall port is in place. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Surgical clips project over the right axilla.
