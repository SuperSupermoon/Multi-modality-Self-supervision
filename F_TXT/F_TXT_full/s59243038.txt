Dense left retrocardiac opacity most likely represent atelectasis. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The lung apices are not captured on the current study, and there may be tiny pneumothoraces, particularly on the right. No sizable pleural effusion on the right. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle may represent a small effusion. Heart size is top normal. Ill-defined lucency projecting over the left superior heart border may represent pneumomediastinum. There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema.
