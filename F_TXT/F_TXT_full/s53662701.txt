ET tube tip lies approximately 5.7 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is not well visualized due to underpenetration, possibly beneath diaphragm. Right IJ central line tip overlies mid SVC. No pneumothorax detected. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Prominence of vascular markings is also unchanged. More confluent opacity at the left lung base and increased retrocardiac opacity are again noted. Presence of a small left effusion would be difficult to exclude.
