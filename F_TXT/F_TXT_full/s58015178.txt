1. Nasogastric tube remains in place with its tip coursing below the diaphragm and not identified on the current study. There continues to be small layering effusions with bilateral airspace process, which is not significantly changed and most likely represents mild-to-moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema, although a diffuse pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning and technique between the studies. No pneumothorax.
