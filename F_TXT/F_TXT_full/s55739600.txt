The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased with resultant bronchovascular crowding and accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The cardiac silhouette appears top-normal in size. There are diffuse interstitial opacities greater on the right than the left with blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles consistent with small pleural effusions. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
