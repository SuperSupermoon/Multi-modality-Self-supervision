As compared to ___ radiograph, chest tubes remain in place in the right hemi thorax with slight increase in size of a small right apical pneumothorax. Right pleural effusion has apparently also slightly increased in size with associated worsening atelectasis in the right mid and lower lung region. Although a small left pleural effusion is unchanged, adjacent atelectasis in the lingula and left lower lobe has minimally worsened.
