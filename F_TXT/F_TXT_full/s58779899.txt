The patient is status post TAVR. Again visualized are the diffuse bilateral reticular interstitial opacities, worse at the bases. This interstitial pattern appears to have worsened in comparison to the prior chest radiograph, which can only be partially explained by the decrease in lung volume. Heart size is stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. There is a radiodense marker in the right lower lung. Surgical clips are visualized in the right upper abdomen. There is a circular radiodensity projecting over the left upper abdomen, which likely represent an ingested pill.
