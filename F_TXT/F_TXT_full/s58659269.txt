Worsening pulmonary edema, now moderate in degree is demonstrated which is asymmetrically more pronounced on the right compared to the left. Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions are again noted, slightly increased in size on the left, but relatively unchanged on the right. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect areas of atelectasis, with linear opacities in the right mid lung field compatible with subsegmental atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the presence of bilateral pleural effusions. The aorta remains markedly tortuous. No pneumothorax is present.
