There has been exchange of the left chest pacemaker, now with two ventricular and a single atrial lead, which appear appropriately positioned. There is interval increase in now mild pulmonary edema, without pneumothorax. There is a new small right pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette remains markedly enlarged, the mediastinal contours are notable for tortuosity of the aorta, with calcification of the aortic knob.
