When compared to previous chest radiographs, the mild vascular congestion has improved. No consolidation or pleural effusion is seen. The cardiac contours are mildly enlarged, and the ET tube ends in appropriate position. The left IJ sheath and a right IJ central line end in the mid to lower SVC and are unchanged in position.
