Single portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval endotracheal tube placement, in a relatively low-lying position, terminating 3 cm above the carina. A nasoenteric tube is in place, with side hole below the level of the gastroesophageal junction, terminating in the stomach. Overlying ventilation support devices are noted. The lung volumes remain low, with progressed opacification in the right lung base, likely infectious. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There is no evidence of large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Biapical pleural thickening is noted, along with left basilar atelectasis.
