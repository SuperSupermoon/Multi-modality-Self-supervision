Lung volume is low. Mild bibasilar opacities are likely secondary to atelectasis and/ or small pleural effusions. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The radiograph is labeled as upright, however patient position appears supine or semi upright. Suboptimal patient position limits the evaluation for pneumoperitoneum. Given the limitation, no evidence of large pneumoperitoneum is identified.
