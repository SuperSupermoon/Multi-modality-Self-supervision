ET tube tip lies at the upper edge of the clavicles, proximally 6.1 cm above the carina, not significantly changed. NG tube tip overlies the gastric fundus. The side port lies in the region of the GE junction, unchanged. The right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip overlies pulmonary outflow tract . Additional lines and tubes are present. No pneumothorax is detected. The patient is status post sternotomy, with prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette, essentially unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora, similar to the prior study. Compared with the prior film, there is new increased retrocardiac opacity, with obscuration of the medial left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. There is a small to moderate left effusion, which appears larger. In addition, there is more pronounced hazy opacity at the right lung base, also with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm.
