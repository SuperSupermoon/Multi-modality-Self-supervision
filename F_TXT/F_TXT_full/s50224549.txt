Lordotic and slightly rotated positioning. Possibility of background hyperinflation/COPD cannot be excluded. The heart is not enlarged. There is slight prominence of the ascending aorta and scattered aortic calcifications. The descending aorta is grossly unremarkable. Within the limits of plain film radiography, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is detected. No CHF, focal infiltrate, effusion, or pneumothorax is identified. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is likely present. Focal calcification overlying the left neck is suggestive of carotid artery calcification.
