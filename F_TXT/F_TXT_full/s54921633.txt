Image quality is somewhat limited by breathing artifact during the examination, as well as patient habitus. There has been interval removal of right-sided IJ central venous catheter. Dense retrocardiac opacity is again seen, with increasing bilateral perihilar opacities in the lower lobes, overall suggestive of worsening pulmonary edema. Sternotomy sutures are again noted. Small pleural effusions may be present, and somewhat layering.
