In comparison with the study of ___, the cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged. There may be minimal elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. Multiple streaks of atelectasis are seen at both bases. Blunting the costophrenic angle raises the possibility of small pleural effusions. No evidence of acute focal consolidation, though an area of more coalescent opacification at the right base could represent an early pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
