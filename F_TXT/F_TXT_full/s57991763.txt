AP chest compared to ___ and ___ at 4:56 a.m.: Tip of the new endotracheal tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles, with the chin in neutral position. Given the relatively superior position of the carina, this is probably acceptable. Patient has had left upper thoracoplasty, and there is only a small region of aerated left lower lobe above a chronically elevated left hemidiaphragm. On the right, small right pleural effusion has increased, and aside from the medial right lower lobe partially obscured by cardiac silhouette, right lung is clear. No pneumothorax. An upper enteric drainage tube loops in the upper part of a non-distended stomach. No pneumothorax.
