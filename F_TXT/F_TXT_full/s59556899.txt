Lung volumes have improved, but there is greater consolidation in the left lower lobe, probably atelectasis due to increasing moderate left pleural effusion. Previous mild pulmonary edema has decreased, but moderate l enlargement of the cardiac silhouette has increased due to an increase in moderate cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. The combination of increasing left pleural effusion and possible pericardial effusion in the setting of decreasing pulmonary edema should raise question of acute pericarditis. There is no pneumothorax. Large hiatus hernia is barely appreciated on this frontal chest radiograph.
