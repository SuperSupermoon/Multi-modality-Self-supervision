Overall lung volumes are low. There are bilateral pleural effusions, and bibasilar atelectasis. New bilateral perihilar opacities, left greater than right, are most consistent with pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly increased from prior. A left chest wall pacemaker is present, with leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle. There is no pneumothorax.
