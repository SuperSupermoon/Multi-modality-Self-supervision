A Swan-Ganz catheter tip is located in the main pulmonary artery, slightly pulled back from the prior study but in appropriate position. Pacemaker leads in the right atrium, right ventricle and coronary sinus are unchanged. The lungs are clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. The imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable. The bones are intact.
