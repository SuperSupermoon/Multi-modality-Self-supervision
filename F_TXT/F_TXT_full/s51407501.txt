Interval placement of an ECMO cannula via a right internal jugular approach and extending to the junction of the right atrium and inferior vena cava. No visible pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in standard position. Widespread bilateral airspace opacities involving the left lung to a greater degree than the right have slightly progressed in the interval, and a moderate-sized left pleural effusion has also worsened.
