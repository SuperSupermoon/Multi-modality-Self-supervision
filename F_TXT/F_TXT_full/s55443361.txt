The patient has been extubated. Nasoenteric tube ends in the stomach. Left PICC has been slightly retracted, now ending at the origin of the SVC. Lung volumes are lower than on the prior study. Left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis is similar to prior with a new right pleural effusion and atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema has worsened. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable allowing for lower lung volumes. No pneumothorax.
