Single supine view of the chest. Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 3.5 cm from the carina, in appropriate position. Enteric tube tip is seen within the stomach, although the side port is likely at the GE junction. There are bilateral mid-to-lower lung parenchymal opacities. There is more focal consolidation in the right upper lung, suggesting overlying fibrotic changes, likely chronic. There is also a 6-mm nodule projecting over the left posterior fifth rib. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Prominence of the mediastinum may be due to position and tortuosity of the vessels. There is suggestion of bilateral effusions given blunting of the costophrenic angles. No acute osseous abnormality is identified.
