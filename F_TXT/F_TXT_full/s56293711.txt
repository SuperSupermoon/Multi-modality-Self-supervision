The lung volumes are low, causing apparent worsening of the bibasilar atelectasis. The nasogastric tube and mediastinal chest tube have been removed. The lucent contour surrounding the right mediastinal contour is no longer present and no evidence of pneumothorax is seen. There is bibasilar atelectasis and fluid in the right minor fissure. There is post-operative cardiomediastinal widening similar to prior post-operative radiographs. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. More prominent peribronchial cuffing suggests mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Lungs are otherwise clear. The right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed but the introducer sheath remains in place. The remainder of the indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard position.
