Single AP semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained. There is mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarge. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle likely relates to overlying soft tissue. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. Surgical hardware is partially visualized in the right humerus.
