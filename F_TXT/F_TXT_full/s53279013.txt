Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged as compared to baseline radiograph of ___. Pulmonary vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness are again demonstrated, minimally improved since the prior study. Left retrocardiac opacity appears unchanged, and is likely due to a combination of left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis at the left lower lobe. Small right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis are not appreciably changed. Drainage catheters are again visualized within the neck.
