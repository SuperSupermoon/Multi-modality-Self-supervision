Given patient positioning and difference in phase of respiratory cycle, there is no significant change compared to prior examination with redemonstration of moderate bilateral pneumothoraces with biapical chest tubes in place. The left apical chest tube appears in satisfactory position in the left apex; however, the tip of the right chest tube is in questionable position appearing to overlay the soft tissues. Extensive pneumopericardium, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum and subcutaneous emphysema leading to the cervical soft tissues are all unchanged from prior study. The cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged. The lungs are essentially clear without focal consolidation. There is no definite pleural effusion. An NG tube is in place in proper position.
