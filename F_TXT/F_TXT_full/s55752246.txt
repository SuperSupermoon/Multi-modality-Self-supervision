ET tube present, tip 3.4 cm above the carina. Right IJ central line tip is at SVC/RA junction, unchanged. Enteric tube tip extends beneath diaphragm, off film. No pneumothorax is detected allowing for overlying iatrogenic devices. Allowing for differences in positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. Diffuse vascular plethora, probably with some associated interstitial and alveolar opacities, again seen. The appearance is slightly improved at the lung bases, compared to 1 day earlier. Minimal blunting the right costophrenic angle, but no gross effusion.
