As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing evidence of a right upper lobe opacity that was not present on the previous film. The opacity could be part of the generalized edematous process but could also represent infection. The patient should be closely monitored. The extent of the relatively large left pleural effusion is overall unchanged, only the distribution is slightly different than on the previous film. Small right pleural effusion with subsequent areas of atelectasis is unchanged. Status post aortic valve replacement. Sternal wires are in situ. Moderate pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
