Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Cardiac size is obscured by the pleuroparenchymal abnormality. Pacer leads are in standard position. Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper SVC. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate-to-large left and small right pleural effusions are unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. There is mild vascular congestion. Sternal wires are aligned. Patient is status post CABG.
