A right internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged with the tip in the mid SVC. A spinal stimulator is unchanged projecting over the lower thoracic spine. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. Note, the stomach is distended and filled with air. The lung volumes are low. Since the prior exam, the bibasilar atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions, and pulmonary edema have all almost completely resolved. There is no focal opacity. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
