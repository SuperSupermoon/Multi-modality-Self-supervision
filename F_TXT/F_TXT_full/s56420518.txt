There is essentially complete opacification of the left hemithorax. A small faint area of residual lucency is seen in the upper zone, but this is decreased compared with ___. The mediastinum remains grossly midline, though the possibility of slight rightward shift of mediastinum would be difficult to exclude. The right lung remains grossly clear, without CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion. Possible minimal atelectasis at right lung base.
