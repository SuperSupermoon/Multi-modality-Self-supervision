Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest shows prominent apical lucencies and cystic spaces compatible with chronic emphysema. Right infrahilar opacity likely represents a summation of normal vasculature. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. The aorta is heavily calcified and tortuous. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
