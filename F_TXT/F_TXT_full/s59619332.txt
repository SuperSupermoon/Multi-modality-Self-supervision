ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carinal. Right subclavian line tip is at the level of lower SVC. There is interval progression of widespread parenchymal opacities that might potentially represent pulmonary edema. Bleeding is another possibility. Bilateral Chest tubes are stable in appearance. Metallic objects overlying the chest are also in unchanged appearance. Stomach bubble appears to be slightly less distended. Right pneumothorax seen on previous CT is currently seen at the apex of the right lung, slightly more conspicuous than on the previous examination.
