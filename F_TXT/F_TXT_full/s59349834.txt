No previous images. There is substantial globular enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with essentially normal pulmonary vessels in a patient with hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia. The discordance between the cardiac size and essentially normal vasculature raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
