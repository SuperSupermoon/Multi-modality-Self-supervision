AP chest compared to ___ and ___: Chest radiographs in ___ showed mild pulmonary edema and a large region of heterogeneous consolidation in the left upper lobe, either cavitary pneumonia or pneumonia in the setting of bullous emphysema. That region has not cleared. There is new opacification in the right mid lung marginated by the minor fissure, quite likely a second focus of infection. Additional imaging workup is needed, and should evaluate the possibility of intrathoracic malignancy, particularly since today's examination suggests the development of many small nodules in the right lower lung. Heart size is normal. Interstitial pulmonary edema is mild, improved from prior examinations. Dr. ___ ___ I discussed these findings by telephone at the time of dictation.
