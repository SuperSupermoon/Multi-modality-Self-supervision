Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study. The cardiomediastinal contour is also unchanged with moderate cardiomegaly. The right hilum appears enlarged, likely reflecting pulmonary arterial hypertension. The central pulmonary vasculature is also prominent. No frank pulmonary edema however. No new airspace opacity seen. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
