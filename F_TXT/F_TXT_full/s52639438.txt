AP chest compared to ___: Moderately severe diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has worsened in the left lung, may be minimally improved on the right.

Other possibilities are pulmonary hemorrhage and drug reaction, as well as pulmonary edema, less likely because of the patient's young age, but perhaps explained by environmental factors. Dr. ___ was paged to discuss these findings when they were discovered at 4:30 p.m., and we discussed the findings by telephone.
