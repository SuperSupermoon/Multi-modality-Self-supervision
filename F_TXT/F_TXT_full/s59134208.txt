Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen terminating approximately 4.6 cm above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen, coursing below the level of the diaphragm, distal tip not well seen. There are diffuse bilateral airspace opacities worrisome for severe pulmonary edema. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, although the right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image.
