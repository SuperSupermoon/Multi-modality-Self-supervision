Lordotic positioning. Compared with ___ at 4:02 a.m., I doubt significant interval change. Again seen are the tracheostomy, right-sided PICC line over mid SVC, left base effusion, and underlying left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Also again seen is upper zone redistribution, with probable background COPD. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle, new compared with ___.
