CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. A tracheostomy tube is present. A right PICC line is present, tip not optimally visualized, but likely over mid SVC. NG tube present, tip beneath diaphragm. Rounded structure overlying the expected location of the stomach presumably represents the PEG. Air previously seen bneath the right and left hemidiaphragms has recolved. Thin curvilinear lucency projecting over the midline likely represents some residual intra-abdominal air. Again seen is cardiomegaly, with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and pulmonary vascular plethora, likely with an element of interstitial edema. No gross right effusion. Small left effusion cannot be excluded.
