AP chest compared to ___: The basal component of pneumothorax has resolved and small left pleural effusion has decreased since ___, but the apical component is very difficult to distinguish from pneumatoceles or hyperexpanded bullae, even by chest CT scan. The complex of large air-filled spaces at the left apex has grown more abnormal over the past several days since ___, even as the basal component of pleural air has resolved with treatment. Hyperinflation of the tracheostomy cuff is a persistent finding, and may be necessary due to over distensibility of the trachea. Clinical correlation advised. Small region of atelectasis at the right lung base is stable. Heart size top normal. No pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
