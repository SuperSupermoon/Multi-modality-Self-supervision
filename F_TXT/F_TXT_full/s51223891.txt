In comparison with the study of ___, there is now a left pigtail catheter in place. There is little apparent change in opacification at the left base, consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis. Little change in the appearance of the right pleural effusion, which appears partially loculated. No evidence of post -procedure pneumothorax.
