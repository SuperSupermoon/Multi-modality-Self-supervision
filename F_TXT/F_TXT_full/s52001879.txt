The lungs are well expanded and clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Artifacts from multiple external lines and supporting devices are present. Linear, tubular appearing opacity crossing the left lower lobe is likely external as well or might represent subsegmental atelectasis.
