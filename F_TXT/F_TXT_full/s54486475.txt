Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. A new left internal jugular central catheter terminates in the mid SVC. The lungs are clear. No pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural effusion. The heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Rightward deviation of the tracheal contour is chronic and consistent with a known left thyroid lobe goiter.
