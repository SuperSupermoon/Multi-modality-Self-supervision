2 chest tubes are positioned on the left lung, one with tip ending superiorly and anteriorly to the apex, the second with tip ending posteriorly and inferiorly to the base of the left lung. There are no signs of pneumothorax. Left pigtail was removed. There pleural fluid on the left base is mildly improved, with evidence of improved lung ventilation. There is an increased opacity of the contralateral lung base that can be due to mild pleural effusion or dependant atelectasis.
