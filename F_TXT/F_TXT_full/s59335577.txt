AP chest compared to ___: ET tube tip at the upper margin of the clavicles is no less than 7 cm from the carina with the chin elevated. It could be advanced 2 cm for more secured seating. Heterogeneous opacification of the lungs could be due to pulmonary edema and concurrent emphysema or widespread aspiration, particularly to the right lower lobe which is more radiopaque than elsewhere. On this supine radiograph, it is difficult to exclude anteriorly collected pneumothorax but there is no evidence of that or of appreciable pleural effusion. The heart is normal size. When feasible, an upright view should be obtained.
