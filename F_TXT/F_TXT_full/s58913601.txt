A right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax is identified. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is similar to the previous study. Mediastinal contours are relatively unchanged. There is mild pulmonary edema, new in the interval, with moderate size left and small to moderate right bilateral pleural effusions, also new in the interval. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
