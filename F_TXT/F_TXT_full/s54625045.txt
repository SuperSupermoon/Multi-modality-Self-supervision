Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest. Left chest wall pacemaker-defibrillator has a lead traversing the right SVC terminating in the right ventricle and another lead arriving in the right atrium by way of a left sided SVC draining into the coronary vein. Lungs are normally expanded. There is blunting and opacity at the left costophrenic sulcus which may represent atelectasis, possibly with small pleural effusion, although infection cannot be completely excluded. However, this area is partially obscured by the pacer. The remaining lung fields are clear. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable; the heart is top normal.
