Again seen is the left-sided pigtail catheter. The catheter configuration is slightly different compared with the prior study, though overall positioning is similar. No pneumothorax is detected. Again seen is retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. No gross left effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits, allowing for minimal surrounding atelectasis. The left paratracheal soft tissues and aortic knob are within normal limits on the current study. The right lung is grossly clear, without CHF. Focal infiltrate, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Left mid clavicular fracture again noted. Alignment is grossly anatomic on this view.
