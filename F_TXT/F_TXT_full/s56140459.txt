AP chest compared to ___: Opacification at the left lung base, probably due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, shows more volume loss today than yesterday. There is, however, more consolidation at the base of the right lung which raises concern for pneumonia. The upper lungs are clear. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed, but no worse. Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view, no longer looped in the upper stomach. Left jugular introducer or dual-channel catheter ends in the upper-to-mid SVC. No pneumothorax.
