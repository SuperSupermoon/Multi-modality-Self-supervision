A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating in the mid thoracic trachea, left PICC terminating in the mid to low SVC, and enteric tube terminating in the stomach. Bilateral pigtail catheters are unchanged in position. Heart size remains moderately enlarged. There is increased left pleural effusion. The right pleural effusion is likely unchanged. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
