AP chest compared to ___, 1:10 a.m.: Lung volumes are lower and bibasilar opacification is worse. This could be all atelectasis, but I am concerned about the development of a rapidly progressive pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Pulmonary vascular congestion is minimal and I doubt pulmonary edema is present. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. ___ at 10:45 a.m.
