The patient is slightly rotated to the left. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Multiple clips are seen overlying the right apex. Rightward upper tracheal displacement is related to known enlarged left thyroid lobe as seen on CT dated ___. The lungs are clear with trace, if any, basilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion. Multiple remote fractures are seen on the left posteriorly, unchanged.
