Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 1.1 cm above the level of the carina, slightly low in position. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, terminating in the expected location of the stomach. Evaluation of the right hemi thorax is limited due to several overlying external structures. In conjunction with the recent prior chest radiograph performed earlier today, there appears to be a moderate right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis and volume loss in the right lung ; additional right hemi thorax opacity may be due to combination of the above, however, consolidation may also be present. Gaseous distention of the stomach. Gaseous distention of loops of bowel in the right abdomen, not well assessed on this study. Clinical concern for bowel obstruction was raised; KUB would further assess.
