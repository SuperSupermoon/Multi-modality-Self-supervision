A tracheostomy tube is in place. Compared with the most recent chest x-ray from ___ at 23:23, there is relatively extensive new opacity in the left lower zone, with retrocardiac density, obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm and hazy opacity extending along the left lower chest wall. There is a very slightly coarsened appearance to the vessels/parenchymal markings in the left upper zone, which is new, but no focal consolidation or evidence of CHF. The cardiac silhouette is also slightly larger. Aside from minimal atelectasis at the right lung base, the right lung and costophrenic sulcus are clear.
