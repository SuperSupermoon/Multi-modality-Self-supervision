Endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet. The right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Stable layering bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities consistent with compressive atelectasis. There has been interval improvement in the mild interstitial edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given patient rotation on the current study.
