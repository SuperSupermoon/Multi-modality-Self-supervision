Assessment is limited due to rightward rotation of the patient. Allowing for this limitation, there is opacification of the right lower lung, likely due to a combination of atelectasis given volume loss with rightward mediastnal shift to the right and possible pleural effusion. Small nodular opacities are seen in the aerated portion of the right lung, potentially vessels on end. The left lung is clear. There is no left-sided effusion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Old bilateral rib fractures are identified. An endotracheal tube is seen ending approximately 4 cm above the carina. An esophageal tube ends beyond the gastroesophageal junction with the tip out of view. Artifact from external monitoring and supporting devices is present.
