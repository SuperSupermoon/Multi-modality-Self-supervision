In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 5.3 cm above the carina. The right IJ catheter tip is probably at the level of the cavoatrial junction. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach. Mild atelectatic changes are again seen in the retrocardiac region.
