Since the prior radiograph, heterogeneous opacities in the right upper and lower lungs have worsened, resulting in more confluent consolidation. Additionally, new retrocardiac opacity may represent worsening atelectasis or infection. Superimposed pulmonary edema is likely. Heart size and mediastinal contour is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely.
