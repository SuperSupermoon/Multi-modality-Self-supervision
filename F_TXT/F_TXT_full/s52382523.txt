A single chest drain tube is seen near the left lung base. Following drainage of the left pleural effusion and left chest tube placement, the moderate to large left pleural effusion has decreased but at residual mild-to-moderate fluid, which at least partially loculated. Faint lucency at left lower thorax is likely a small amount of loculated air and probably procedural related. Right mild pleural effusion associated with right lower lung atelectasis is new since ___. Due to the obscuration of the left cardiomediastinal border, its assessment was limited. Bilateral upper lungs are clear.
