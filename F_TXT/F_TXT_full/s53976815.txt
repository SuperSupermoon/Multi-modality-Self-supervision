AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. During the latest interval, a Dobbhoff line has been placed, seen to pass well below the diaphragm. The Dobbhoff line follows the curve of the stomach and apparently has passed the pylorus as its distal portion assumes the contours of the duodenal loop. The line escapes in the lower limit of the image and cannot be followed. It does not appear in the area of the proximal jejunal loops. Pulmonary appearance is unchanged. Right-sided PICC line as before. Other lines are apparently external overlying the chest.
