Single portable AP upright radiograph through the chest is compared to radiograph dated ___. When compared to prior study, there appears to be increased opacification of the left basilar hemi thorax consistent with moderate pleural effusion. Obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm is additionally present, most compatible with a right-sided pleural effusion as well. The left heart border is not clearly defined and assessment of the heart size is therefore limited. Hilar contours appear stable when compared to prior study. Patient is status post tracheostomy which appears to be in appropriate position. There is dense calcification of the mitral annulus. Aortic atherosclerotic calcifications are noted. There is no pneumothorax. Visualized osseous structures demonstrates no acute abnormality. A prior right-sided PICC is no longer identified. A tubular structure within the right axillary space is noted. Question if this is external to the patient or a retracted PICC. There is new moderate pulmonary edema
