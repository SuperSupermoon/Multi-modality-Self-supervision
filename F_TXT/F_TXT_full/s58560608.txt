Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. There is bibasilar atelectasis, and a small right-sided pleural effusion. Increased pulmonary vascular congestion is consistent with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. A chest tube projects over the right hemi thorax. A right-sided Port-A-Cath and the distal SVC. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The neoesophagus is fluid-filled. There is no pneumothorax.
