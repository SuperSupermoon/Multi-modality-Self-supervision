Tip of the endotracheal tube terminates approximately 9.8 cm above the carina, and should be advanced approximately 5 cm for standard positioning. There is apparent overdistention of the cuff of the tube at the level of the vocal cords. At the time of this radiographic interpretation, the tube has been advanced and the cuff is no longer overdistended based upon review of subsequently obtained radiograph under clip ___on ___. Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, with residual right internal jugular vascular sheath remaining in place. Focal contour deformity of the sheath is noted at the expected skin insertion site. A small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax is apparently new compared to the prior radiograph. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Patchy and linear opacities at the bases probably represent atelectasis, and there is also suggestion of small pleural effusions bilaterally. Subcutaneous emphysema is present in the right chest wall. Radiographic findings have been discussed by telephone with ___ at 8:30 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.
