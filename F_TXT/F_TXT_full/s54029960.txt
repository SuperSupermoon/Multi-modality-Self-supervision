In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again no evidence of pneumothorax following chest tube removal. The other monitoring and support devices remain in place. There is continued opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe. The right lung is essentially clear.
