Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 7.6 cm from the carina. Enteric tube tip is within the proximal stomach, although the side port is just proximal to the gastroesophageal junction. Heart size is borderline enlarged. The aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. Cephalization of pulmonary markings suggest mild pulmonary vascular engorgement. Lungs are hyperinflated with upper lobe lucency in attenuation of pulmonary vascular markings suggestive of underlying COPD and emphysema. Patchy atelectasis is noted in lung bases without focal consolidation. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified. No displaced fractures are evident.
