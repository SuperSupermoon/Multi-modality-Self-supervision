2 NG tubes tips are in the stomach. ET tube tip is 5.8 cm above the carinal. Right PICC line tip is at the level of mid to lower SVC. Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior to mid SVC. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Left more than right consolidations are extensive but unchanged since previous examination, representing a combination of interstitial lung disease and potentially superimposed infectious process. No worsening of the consolidation demonstrated since previous examination. As previously suggested interstitial pulmonary edema might contribute to part of the process but decreased size separation between three processes: Infection, edema and fibrosis of the lungs is impossible on the basis of the chest radiograph.
