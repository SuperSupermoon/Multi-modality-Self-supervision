Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous, similar compared to the prior exam. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Evaluation of the lung apices is limited due to the patient's chin and soft tissues of the neck projecting over this region. Lung volumes are low. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is present. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified. Mild interstitial abnormality within the lung bases as well as within the right upper lung field is similar compared to the prior exam and may reflect chronic changes. No acute osseous abnormalities seen.
