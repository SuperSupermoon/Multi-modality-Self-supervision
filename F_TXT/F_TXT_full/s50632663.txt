The neoesophagus is distended and predominantly fluid filled, but the degree of distention has decreased compared to the prior radiograph. Nasogastric tube remains in place in the conduit. Moderate right pleural effusion is again demonstrated with adjacent atelectasis in the right middle and lower lobes, slightly worse compared to the prior study. Left basilar atelectasis and effusion are slightly improved. Previously reported bowel herniation within the left hemithorax is again demonstrated with increased distention of bowel loops. This could be more fully evaluated by CT if warranted clinically.
