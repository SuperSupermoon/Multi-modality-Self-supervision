Since the prior radiograph from earlier today, a left internal jugular vascular sheath has been placed, terminating at the junction of the left internal jugular and left brachiocephalic veins. A tiny left apical pneumothorax has apparently decreased in size since the recent radiograph. No other relevant change.
