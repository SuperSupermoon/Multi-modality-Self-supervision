A portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates intact sternal wires, mediastinal clips, and a right PICC which terminates in the low SVC. Heart size is normal. There is mild pulmonary edema, new compared to prior exam. Small bilateral pleural effusions are similar to slightly increased in size. A rounded area opacification along the right lateral hemi thorax may also represent loculated effusion, present dating back to ___. Retrocardiac opacity, likely due to atelectasis, is unchanged. Bibasilar atelectasis is greater on the left than right. There is no definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
