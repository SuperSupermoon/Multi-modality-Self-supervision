Linear opacity at the left base favors subsegmental atelectasis. More patchy opacity at the right base could reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. No pulmonary edema. Possible small right effusion. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal limits.
