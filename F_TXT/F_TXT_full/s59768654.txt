A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right internal jugular line, with the tip terminating in the distal SVC. A device projecting over the left scapula may represent a nerve stimulator. Lung volumes are low, with bibasilar atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, also likely related to low lung volumes. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
