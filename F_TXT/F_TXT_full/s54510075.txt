Following removal of the rib right pigtail pleural drainage catheter, there has probably been an increase in moderate right pleural effusion obscuring much of the right lung making it difficult to say whether mild pulmonary edema has developed as well. Small left pleural effusion has increased. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess, probably stable and moderately enlarged. No endotracheal tube is seen. Right jugular line ends in the right atrium as before. No pneumothorax.
