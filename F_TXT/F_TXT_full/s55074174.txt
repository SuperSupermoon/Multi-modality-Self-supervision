Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and ___. Currently, the left chest tube is in place with subcutaneous air which appears to be slightly increased, but no definitive pneumothorax seen on the left. On the right, there is a large skin fold demonstrated with its being unlikely to represent the pneumothorax. To confirm that, repeated radiograph is recommended after removal of all the potential skinfolds. Small amount of right pleural effusion is noted, most likely unchanged as compared to the prior study.
