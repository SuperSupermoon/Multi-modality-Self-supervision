Comparison is made to the prior study, ___. Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion has improved. Right lower lobe opacity consistent with atelectasis has worsened. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated as before. Mild vascular congestion is probably unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Sternal wires are aligned. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated, it is obscured by pleural or parenchymal abnormality.
