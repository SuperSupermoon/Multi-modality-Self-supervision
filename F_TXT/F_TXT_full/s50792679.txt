There is no evidence of pneumothorax following the recent biopsy procedure. Poorly-defined nodule in the right upper lobe appears less well defined with adjacent new opacity inferiorly, possibly due to post-procedural hemorrhage. A new focus of opacity is present in the anterior right upper lobe adjacent to the minor fissure and may reflect localized atelectasis, hemorrhage, or aspiration. Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Focal area of scar in left paracardiac region is unchanged.
