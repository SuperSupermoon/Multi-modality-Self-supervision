In comparison with the study of ___, obliquity of the patient somewhat obscures detail. There is generalized osteopenia of the visualized bony elements, making it very difficult to identify nondisplaced rib fractures. However, there is no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size without appreciable vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. There is mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
