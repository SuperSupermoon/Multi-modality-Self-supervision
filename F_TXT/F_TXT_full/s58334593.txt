As compared to the previous image, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position. The pre-existing opacity at the right upper lobe base is no longer visible. However, bilateral pleural effusions are more extensive than on the previous image, particularly on the right. In addition, peribronchial cuffing suggests mild interstitial pulmonary edema. There is unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with a shape of the cardiac silhouette potentially suggesting pericardial effusion. Radiographic findings should be correlated with the clinical patient presentation, and complemented with echocardiography.
