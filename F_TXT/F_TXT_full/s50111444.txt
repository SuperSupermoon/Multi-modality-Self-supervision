There is a left chest Port-A-Cath with distal tip overlying the cavoatrial junction. The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits. The hila are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is diffuse reticulonodular interstitial opacity worst at the lung bases, and better evaluated on prior CT torso. Given tree-in-___ appearance on that examination, findings are concerning for multifocal infection, including but not limited to mycobacterium organisms including tuberculosis, and fungal pneumonia.
