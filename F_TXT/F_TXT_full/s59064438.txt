In comparison with the study of ___, there is been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends at least to the lower body of the stomach where it crosses the inferior margin of the image. The patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration, though there again is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pulmonary opacities consistent with pulmonary edema. Probably little change in the pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis. The PICC line again terminates in the right atrium. The questioned narrowing of the lower cervical trachea is not definitely appreciated at this time. A CT of the trachea could be obtained if there are significant symptoms.
