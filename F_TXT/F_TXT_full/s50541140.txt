There is no appreciable pneumothorax. A right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the upper right atrium. An endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the thoracic inlet, and may be advanced by 2-3 cm for more optimal ventilation. A nasogastric tube enters the stomach, tip not visualized. Small layering pleural effusions with bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis are unchanged. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limits despite the projection. A third radiopaque tube projects over the add line cervical soft tissues, terminates at the level of the first rib. If there is a second intended device, it ends in the neck.
