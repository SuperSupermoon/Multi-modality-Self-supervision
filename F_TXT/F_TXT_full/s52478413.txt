In comparison with the study of ___, there has been mild decrease in opacification at the left base. The overall appearance could reflect chronic pulmonary interstitial disease with a more focal area of opacification at the right base consistent with aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Small amount of dense opacification is seen at the right base medially, consistent with the clinical history of barium aspiration. Residual contrast material is also seen below the hemidiaphragm on the left.
