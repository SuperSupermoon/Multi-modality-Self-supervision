The mid to lower lungs are relatively underpenetrated, presumed due to patient body habitus. No large pleural effusion is seen. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Mild prominence and indistinctness of the central pulmonary vasculature suggests pulmonary vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
