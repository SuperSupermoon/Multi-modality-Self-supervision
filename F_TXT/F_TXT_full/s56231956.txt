Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates left lower lobe atelectasis with associated volume loss, obscuring part of the left hemidiaphragm. Hazy opacifications are seen bilaterally along with prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature, suggesting some pulmonary vascular congestion. Allowing for AP projection, the heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax or focal consolidation. A metallic opacity is seen projecting over the left lower hemithorax and may represent a bullet fragment.
