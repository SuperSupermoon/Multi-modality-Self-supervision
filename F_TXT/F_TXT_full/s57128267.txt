Progressive opacification right lung base could be due in part to pleural effusion, but is more likely pulmonary. In the absence of clear rightward mediastinal shift, this is probably due to worsening right lower lobe pneumonia. Lungs are otherwise clear of focal abnormality. Heart size top-normal has increased slightly, and pulmonary vasculature is more dilated but there is no pulmonary edema. ET tube tip is between 2 and 3 cm above carinal with the chin elevated and should be withdrawn 15 mm for optimal placement. Esophageal drainage tube ends in nondistended stomach. No pneumothorax or appreciable left pleural effusion.
