Of note, the study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. There is interval improvement of previously noted right moderate-to-large pneumothorax status post chest tube placement with small residual pneumothorax and partial re-expansion of the right lung. The right chest tube is seen projecting over the right lung apex. The left lung remains grossly clear. There is no focal consolidation in the left lung. The heart size is normal. S shaped scoliosis is unchanged. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the right chest wall.
