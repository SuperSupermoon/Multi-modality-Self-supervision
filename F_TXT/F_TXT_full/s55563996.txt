A frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a left chest wall pacer device with leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle. The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains normal. Lung volumes are lower, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged, but right base opacity is increased. No large pneumothorax identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
