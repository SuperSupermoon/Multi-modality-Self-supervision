AP chest compared to 4:18 a.m.: Severe pulmonary edema has improved. Asymmetric distribution raises the possibility of concurrent pneumonia, but all the findings could be due to edema since there has been a relatively substantial improvement over just four hours. Moderate right pleural effusion stable. Mild cardiomegaly unchanged. No pneumothorax.
