Rotated positioning. Left-sided pacemaker is present, lead tips unchanged. This obscures small portion of the left lateral chest. Compared with the prior film, catheter at the left lung base is no longer visualized. Otherwise, the appearance is similar, except for slight increase in the amount of increased retrocardiac density --___ could reflect some increased pleural fluid and/or collapse and/or consolidation. The ovoid lucency seen medially, as before, could represent a small amount of loculated pneumothorax. No pneumothorax is seen at the left lung apex. The appearance of the right lung is unchanged, with a small right base pleural effusion, but otherwise no infiltrate or consolidation. No right-sided pneumothorax. No CHF.
