Lungs remain low in volume. Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis is more pronounced. Upper lungs clear. Borderline cardiomegaly is exaggerated by low lung volumes. Mediastinal widening probably due to combination of fat deposition and vascular engorgement is unchanged. No definite pleural abnormality.
