As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone right thoracocentesis. The pre-existing right pleural effusion has decreased in extent but the small amount of effusion is still seen along the basal and lateral aspect of the right hemi thorax. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities, notably on the left, have decreased in extent and severity. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. Low lung volumes are unchanged.
