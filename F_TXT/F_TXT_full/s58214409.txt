AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position. Previously described basal parenchymal densities persist. Comparison suggests stable findings on the right base but some regression on the left base. If the findings on the left base seen on the latest preceding study were interpreted as pneumonia, one can state that some regression has occurred. No other significant interval change can be identified.
