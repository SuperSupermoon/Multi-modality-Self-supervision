The right hydropneumothorax is unchanged from comparison study approximately 4.5 hours prior. The air-fluid level is less evident on this study most likely due to differences in patient position. The shift of the mediastinal structures is similarly unchanged, as is the combination of nodules and peribronchial infiltration in the right lower lung. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are unchanged.
