As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence of non-characteristic apical scarring as well as of moderate overinflation. Moderate cardiomegaly persists, and areas of atelectasis and bronchiectasis are seen in the lower lungs. There is no convincing evidence of a new parenchymal opacity, but the pre-existing right lower lobe opacity is slightly larger than on the previous image, raising concern for developing pneumonia, as previously noted. No pneumothorax.
