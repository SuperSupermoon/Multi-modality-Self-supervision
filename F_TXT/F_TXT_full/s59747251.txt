Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increased opacification of the left upper lung field consistent with pneumonia. There is a small area of increased opacification of the left base, which likely represents atelectasis. There is a stable appearing right upper lung nodule. The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. The heart is top normal in size. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction.
