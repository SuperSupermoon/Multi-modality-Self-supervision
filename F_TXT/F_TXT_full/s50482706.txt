Lung volumes are low, making comparison to prior exam slightly limited due to different lung volumes. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions persist with adjacent atelectasis. Bibasilar parenchymal opacities persist. No pneumothorax is seen. Left-sided pigtail catheter is partially evaluated. Right-sided pigtail catheter is not well seen on this study.
