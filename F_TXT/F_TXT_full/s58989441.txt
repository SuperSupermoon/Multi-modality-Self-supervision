Portable chest radiographs demonstrates bilateral low lung volumes with crowding of vascular structures. Minimal pulmonary edema evident. Minimal blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles may indicate small pleural effusions. Apparent widening of the mediastinum and increased cardiac silhouette is likely reflective of portable technique, low lung volumes, patient positioning and postoperative state. No osseous abnormality identified.
