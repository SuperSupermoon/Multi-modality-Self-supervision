Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. A right PICC is again seen, terminating at the cavoatrial junction. Minimal pulmonary vascular congestion persists. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggesting a trace pleural effusion. A trace right pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
