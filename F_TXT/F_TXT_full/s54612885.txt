Single portable view of the chest. Correlation is made to previous exam from ___. There is stable left basilar opacity which silhouettes the hemidiaphragm, potentially due to any combination of effusion and atelectasis or consolidation. Linear opacity at the right lung base is suggestive of atelectasis. Tracheostomy tube is in stable position. Cardiac silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
