Comparison is made with prior study CT torso performed 6 hours earlier. Cardiac size is top normal. Widened mediastinum is unchanged, due to mediastinal fat. There is no evident pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There are low lung volumes. Bilateral basal opacities left greater than right and right upper lobe opacities are unchanged, a combination of atelectasis and aspiration.
