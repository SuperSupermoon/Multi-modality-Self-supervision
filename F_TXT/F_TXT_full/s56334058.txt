An obliquely positioned chest radiograph is submitted for interpretation and is centered on the right lung, excluding a majority of the left lung from the field of view. The radiograph is satisfactory for assessing the newly placed right internal jugular central venous catheter, which terminates in the lower superior vena cava, but it does not allow for comprehensive assessment of the chest. There is no visible pneumothorax. Repeat radiograph with standard positioning may be helpful if there is clinical concern for any issue other than line positioning.
