The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. There is persistent opacification of the left lung base with a pleural effusion, but probably decreased somewhat. What is new, however, is an opacity in the right lower lung, probably in the right lower lobe, noting that it does not silhouette either the right cardiac border or hemidiaphragm.
