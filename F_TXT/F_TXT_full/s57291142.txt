Compared to the most recent chest radiograph, there is interval improvement of the pre-existing upper lung opacities bilaterally. However, there is interval worsening of a right cardiophrenic opacity and left retrocardiac opacity. The previously-noted discrete right upper lung nodular density is only faintly visualized in the current study but remains suspicious for a primary lung cancer. Otherwise no relevant short interval changes.
