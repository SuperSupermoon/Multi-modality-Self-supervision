No Dobbhoff tube is visualized. Expected postoperative findings with surgical clips overlying the right lower lung, multiple right-sided chest tubes, as well as evidence of volume loss on the right, and subcutaneous emphysema. Overall, there is increased dense multifocal opacifications which could represent edema, but without evidence of left hilar engorgement or significant hazy pulmonary vasculature, suspect that this is a worsening multifocal pneumonia. Right perihilar opacification has increased in size, which may indicate post-operative hematoma. Lucencies at the costophrenic and costovertebral angles indicate pneumothorax. Unable to assess for right pleural effusion. Possible new left pleural effusion developing.
