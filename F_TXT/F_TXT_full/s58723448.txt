AP chest compared to ___: Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. Moderate cardiomegaly has increased, lung volumes have decreased, mild pulmonary edema has worsened, bibasilar atelectasis is more pronounced, and there is likely a new or increased small-to-moderate right pleural effusion. There are no findings in the upper lungs to suggest pneumonia, but the lower lungs are not sufficiently displayed to exclude it. Biventricular atrial pacer defibrillator leads are in standard positions, unchanged. No pneumothorax.
