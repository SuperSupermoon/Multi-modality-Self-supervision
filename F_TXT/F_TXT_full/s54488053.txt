Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Thoracolumbar scoliosis is again seen. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The surgical clips again overlie the right breast. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Subtle left upper lobe opacity projecting over the posterior left sixth rib may relate to osseous structure, although an underlying consolidation is not excluded and not clearly seen on the prior radiograph from ___. Recommend followup to resolution.
