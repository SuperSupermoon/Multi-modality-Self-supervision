Patient is status post esophagogastrectomy. Lung volumes are low. Diffuse bilateral opacities are likely due to a combination of mild pulmonary congestion, small bilateral pleural effusions, and compressive bibasilar atelectasis. Widening of the mediastinum is expected in the postoperative setting. There is interval placement of new pleural drain catheters. A small right apical pneumothorax is appreciated. Heart size is unchanged. A feeding tube can be followed as far as the gastric pull-through.
