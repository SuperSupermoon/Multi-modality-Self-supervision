Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Underlying soft tissues cause some underpenetration. Given this, there appears to be moderate pulmonary vascular congestion/edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged. Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle is most likely due to overlying soft tissue, although very trace pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No right pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax. No focal consolidation is seen.
