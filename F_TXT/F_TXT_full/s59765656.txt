1. Nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the distal stomach or proximal duodenum. Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC abutting the lateral wall. No pneumothorax. Bilateral layering effusions with associated bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting atelectasis. Probable interval development of mild perihilar and interstitial edema. Cardiac contours are difficult to assess due to the bibasilar airspace process. Mediastinal contours appear stable. No pneumothorax. Clips in the right upper quadrant consistent with prior cholecystectomy. Abdominal drainage catheter remains in place.
