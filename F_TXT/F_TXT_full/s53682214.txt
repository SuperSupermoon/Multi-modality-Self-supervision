Borderline cardiomegaly is again noted. Opacification at the left lung base consistent with pleural effusion and adjacent compressive atelectasis appears improved since most recent prior examination of ___. Underlying infectious process cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical setting. Minimal opacification in right lung base may represent atelectasis. The right PICC tip projects over the expected region of the mid SVC. The tracheostomy tube appears slightly angulated with respect to the trachea and needs to be repositioned.
