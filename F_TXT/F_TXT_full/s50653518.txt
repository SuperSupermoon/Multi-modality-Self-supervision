A pigtail catheter is noted projecting over the right mid lung field laterally. There has been marked interval decrease in size of the previously demonstrated right pneumothorax, with only a small residual apical pneumothorax demonstrated. Previously noted leftward shift of mediastinal structures is also improved. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion is demonstrated.
