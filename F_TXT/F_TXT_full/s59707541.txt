The lungs are moderately well-expanded. There is pulmonary edema of at least moderate severity. Opacity in the left lung base likely represents a layering pleural effusion, possibly with some degree of loculation. Coinciding opacity is probably present and compatible with atelectasis. There is a small to moderate right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable from prior exam. Aortic arch calcifications are again noted. Results are similar to the examination from earlier on the same day.
