Heart is top normal size. Widening of the mediastinum is consistent with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy as seen on CT scan. Lung volumes are low with atelectasis seen in both bases. There is an opacity projecting over the mid right lung likely corresponding to the site of intervention possibly reflecting hemorrhage in that region. Neighboring hilar region also appears to have increased in size, likely secondary to the same process. Left lung is clear. No significant pleural effusions, and no pneumothorax.
