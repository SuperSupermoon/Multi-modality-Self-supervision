AP chest compared to ___: Mild cardiomegaly is stable and there is no appreciable pleural abnormality. Pulmonary vascular engorgement is mild. There is a suggestion of greater opacification in the right upper lung than anywhere else. It would be useful to obtain a fully erect view to see if this is a pulmonary abnormality such as developing pneumonia or overlying soft tissue. Findings were discussed with the house officer at 10:20 a.m.
