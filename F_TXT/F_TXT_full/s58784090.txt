There is slight interval improved aeration at the left apex but the left hemithorax remains nearly completely opacified likely reflecting a combination of lung collapse, possibly related to mucus plugging, and layering pleural fluid. The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. A left subclavian PICC line and right pleural apical pigtail catheter are unchanged in position. Faint opacity in the right upper lung is again seen and is stable consistent with aspiration or pneumonia. The remaining right lung is clear. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Spinal hardware is again seen overlying the visualized cervical and upper thoracic spine. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
