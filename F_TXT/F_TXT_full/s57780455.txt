In comparison to the radiograph obtained 1 day prior, no significant changes are appreciated. A small amount of medial left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged. Pleural effusions are small, if any. Lungs are otherwise fully expanded and clear. Heart size and cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. No pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. A right-sided PICC terminates the lower SVC. A VP shunt descends and terminates in the right upper quadrant.
