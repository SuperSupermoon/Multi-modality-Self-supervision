In comparison to the most recent prior study, the patient has been intubated with the tip of the endotracheal tube terminating at the level of the thoracic inlet, approximately 43 mm above the carina. An abandoned left subclavian catheter fragment is unchanged over multiple prior studies. A left supraclavicular central venous catheter is unchanged in position with the tip terminating at the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and the SVC. Suture chain material is again noted in the right lung base. The inspiratory lung volumes remain low with associated mild bibasilar atelectasis. No large pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is present. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no overt pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is top normal in size but stable with minimal calcification at the aortic knob.
