Interval placement of right subclavian central line which has its tip in the proximal right atrium. Pull-back by 4 cm would place the tip in the distal SVC. Left subclavian central line has its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip 3 cm above the carina. Lung volumes are diminished with patchy bibasilar opacities favoring atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No pulmonary edema.
