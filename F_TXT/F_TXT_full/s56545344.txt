Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There is persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and overlying atelectasis. Trace left pleural effusion is difficult to exclude. There is persistent enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, similar to prior. Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 2.8 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the diaphragm, likely terminating in the expected location of the proximal stomach.
