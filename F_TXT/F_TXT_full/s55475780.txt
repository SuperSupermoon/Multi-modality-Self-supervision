A right-sided chest tube is in unchanged position. A moderate right-sided pneumothorax is unchanged in size, but there is new extensive subcutaneous emphysema throughout the right chest wall. The nodular opacity which was seen previously at the right lung apex is not as well visualized; however, there is progression of pulmonary vascular congestion and diffuse opacity throughout the partially atelectatic right lung which may partially obscure the margins. Left basilar atelectasis is unchanged with no left-sided pleural effusion. Osseous structures appear unchanged. Multiple calcified granulomas are again seen throughout the left lung.
