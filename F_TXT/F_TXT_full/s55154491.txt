Semi-erect AP views of the chest were obtained. Again seen is extensive nodular pleural thickening involving the right lung compatible with metastatic pleural disease. Persistent opacification is seen within the right lung base, unchanged from ___.

There is new opacification of the left lung base, which could be related to effusion, however, cannot exclude consolidation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from prior exam. There is no pneumothorax.
