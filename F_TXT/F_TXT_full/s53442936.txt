The cardiac contours are not well delineated, but the heart is probably mild to moderately enlarged. The lung volumes are low. Streaky right basilar opacity suggests minor atelectasis. There is more extensive but vague left lower lung opacity; a pleural effusion is suspected on the left but not well demonstrated. There is no pneumothorax. An endotracheal tube terminates below the thoracic inlet about 6 cm above the carina, and an orogastric tube courses into the stomach.
