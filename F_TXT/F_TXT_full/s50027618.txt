Left lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema again noted. The previously reported small left apical pneumothorax is not definitively seen on this examination. Patchy bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, which likely reflect atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. There continues to be left lateral pleural thickening which could reflect a component of loculated fluid. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged but somewhat difficult to assess due to the opacification at the left base.
