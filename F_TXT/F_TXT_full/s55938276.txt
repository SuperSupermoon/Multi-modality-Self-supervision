As compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, left chest tube has changed in position with evidence of a tiny left apical pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. Note is made of interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube, the latter associated with development of mild gastric distension. With the exception of worsening atelectasis made right lower lobe, appearance of the chest is otherwise unchanged.
