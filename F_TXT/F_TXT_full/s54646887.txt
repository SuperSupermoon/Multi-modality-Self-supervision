Cardiac silhouette is severely enlarged due to cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion. Opacification at the base of the right hemi thorax is due to a combination of pleural effusion and parenchymal abnormality which could be either pneumonia or atelectasis. The remainder of the lungs is clear of any focal abnormality or pulmonary edema and the pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature are not engorged.
