There has been interval placement of an enteric tube with the tip coursing below the left hemidiaphragm, into the stomach and off the inferior borders of the film. Low lung volumes remain with patchy opacities at the lung bases most likely reflective of atelectasis. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is identified.
