Compared with ___ at 11:29 and allowing for differences in positioning and technique, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is prominent retrocardiac opacity, with a single surgical clip overlying the cardiac silhouette. As before, the possibility of a left-sided effusion cannot be excluded. Also again seen is upper zone redistribution an atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region, in the setting of low inspiratory volumes. Allowing for this, the right lung is otherwise grossly clear. No pneumothorax is detected in the setting of lordotic positioning. Prominent lucency is seen in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, but could represent gas within the stomach.
