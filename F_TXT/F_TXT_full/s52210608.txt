A single portable chest radiograph is provided. The lungs are clear. No pneumothorax is identified. Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique. No pleural effusions are present. Right clavicular displacement has improved although the right clavicle still appears slightly lower than the left at the sternocleidal junction. This is not ideally assessed on a portable CXR and could be more fully evaluated on standard clavicle radiographs when the patient's condition permits.
