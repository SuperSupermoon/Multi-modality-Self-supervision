Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Again, there is mild central pulmonary vascular congestion. A left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected positions of the right atrium and right ventricle. Azygos lobe is incidentally noted. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No evidence of free air is seen beneath the diaphragms.
