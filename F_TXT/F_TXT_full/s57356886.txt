In comparison with the study of ___, the left PICC line has been repositioned with the tip in the upper to midportion of the SVC. There is still bilateral opacification consistent with some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. Poor definition of the hemidiaphragms with haziness at the bases is consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in good position.
