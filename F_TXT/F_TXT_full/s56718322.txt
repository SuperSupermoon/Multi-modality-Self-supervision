Lung volumes are low on the right without convincing evidence of lobar atelectasis. There are multiple right-sided rib deformities consistent with old rib fractures. No pneumothorax. There is mild prominence of the bilateral hila and pulmonary vasculature consistent with a mild degree of congestive heart failure but no frank pulmonary edema. Mild cardiomegaly may be exaggerated by the projection. No consolidation or pleural effusion seen.
