Rotated positioning. A Port-A-Cath type catheter is present, tip probably also overlies the distal SVC. Again seen is cardiomegaly, with a globular configuration. Also again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with air bronchograms obscuration of left hemidiaphragm. The possibility of associated left pleural fluid cannot be excluded. The upper portion left lung is grossly clear without CHF or focal infiltrate. No left-sided pneumothorax. On the right, 2 chest tubes are seen at the base of the lung. Fluid and air may be present tracking at the right lung apex. Compare to the prior study, there is a new large lobulated opacity along the right mediastinum and in the right mid zone. A small amount pleural fluid is seen in the right sulcus. The etiology of this is unclear. Most likely etiology is some loculated fluid along the medial surface of the right lung, together with fluid along the minor fissure. Collapse of a portion of the lung is considered less likely. Surrounding the right mid zone opacity, the vascular markings are essentially normal, only minimally prominent. Residual subcutaneous emphysema again noted in the right supraclavicular area and along the right lower chest wall.
