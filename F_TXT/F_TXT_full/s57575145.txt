Pigtail drainage catheter projects over the right diaphragmatic region. The right lung base is elevated, but the precise location of the diaphragm with regard to the pleural space is indeterminate. Subpulmonic pleural effusion could therefore be present. Pleural effusion is otherwise small. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinum midline. Left lung and pleural space normal.
