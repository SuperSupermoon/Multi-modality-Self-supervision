Patient is status post aortic valve replacement and CABG with median sternotomy wires in place. Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size, which is likely mildly enlarged. There is central vascular congestion with mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Small right pleural effusion. Probable trace left effusion. No pneumothorax. Bibasilar parenchymal opacities, left greater than right, suggest atelectasis, though aspiration cannot be definitively excluded.
