Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position, including left subclavian vascular catheter, which terminates at the junction of the left subclavian, left brachiocephalic veins. Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema. A more confluent area of opacity in the right lower lobe has worsened in the interval, and a poorly defined opacity at the left lung base is also slightly worse. These findings may correspond to reported multilobar infection on prior CT. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions also appear slightly increased in the interval, but positional differences may contribute to this apparent change.
