A new enteric catheter courses below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view inferiorly. There has been marked improvement in aeration of the left mid-to-lower lung, status post bronchoscopy with presumed removal of a mucous plug. Moderate left lower lung/retrocardiac atelectasis persists. Concomitant infection or re-expansion edema in this region is not excluded. A small left pleural effusion may be present. There may also be a tiny right pleural effusion, not significantly changed. There is no pneumothorax. The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours are normal.
