AP chest compared to 8:32 a.m.: Much of the left pleural effusion has been withdrawn. Some may be loculated at the level of the hilus or this could be overlying soft tissue due to local tumor recurrence in the anterior chest wall, but there is no pneumothorax and only minimal layering pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Right lung is grossly clear.
