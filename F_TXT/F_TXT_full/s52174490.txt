Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits for technique. Improving opacity at left lung base is probably a combination of decreased pleural effusion and improving atelectasis in this region. No new confluent areas of consolidation are present to suggest the presence of a pneumonia, but standard PA and lateral chest radiograph may be helpful for more complete evaluation of the residual left basilar opacity if warranted clinically.
