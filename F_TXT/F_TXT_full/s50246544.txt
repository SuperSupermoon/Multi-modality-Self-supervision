Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 7 cm from the carina, in standard position. An electronic device is seen projecting over the aortic arch and main pulmonary artery. The heart is top normal in size with left ventricular predominance. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky opacity in the left lung base with mild tenting of the diaphragm suggests atelectasis with volume loss. Blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally likely reflects the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
