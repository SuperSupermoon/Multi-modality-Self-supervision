AP chest compared to ___: Upper lobes are clear. Left infrahilar consolidation has improved, rendering the left hemidiaphragm visible. Pleural effusion is small on the left if any. Right diaphragmatic pleural calcification noted with interest. Right infrahilar consolidation has improved. Either or both of these could be areas of pneumonia or recent aspiration or atelectasis. Conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs would be very helpful. ET tube in standard position. Right jugular line ends in the right atrium and would need to be withdrawn 2.5 cm to re-position it with confidence low in the SVC, if desired. No pneumothorax.
