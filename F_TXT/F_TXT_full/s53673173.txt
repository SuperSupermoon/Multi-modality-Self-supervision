Cardiac silhouette size is normal. The aorta remains tortuous, and mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Lungs appear hyperinflated without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax, however the extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. No gross acute osseous abnormalities are present.
