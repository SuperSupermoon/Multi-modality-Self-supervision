In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral effusions and compressive atelectasis at the base. Possible areas of post-traumatic contusion could be responsible for some of the ill-defined basilar opacities. Monitoring and support devices remain in place and there is no definite pneumothorax. The multiple bilateral rib fractures are better seen on previous CT. Subcutaneous gas persists outlining pectoral muscle bundles and along the right lateral chest wall.
