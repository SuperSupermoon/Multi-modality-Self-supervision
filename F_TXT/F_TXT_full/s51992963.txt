Right-sided PICC terminates in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. Subtle increase in right base opacity is seen which may be due to atelectasis or aspiration, but evolving infection is not excluded. Attention at follow-up. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The left lung is essentially clear.
