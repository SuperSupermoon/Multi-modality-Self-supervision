Compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, a PleurX catheter is been placed, with reduction in size of left pleural effusion. A large homogeneous opacity in the left mid hemi thorax may reflect residual loculated pleural fluid although a mass could have a similar appearance. Adjacent lung has partially re-expanded the some residual atelectasis or consolidation in the left lower lobe. Multifocal linear atelectasis is present in the right mid and lower lung.
