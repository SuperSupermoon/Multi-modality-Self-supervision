AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema, worse on the right, has been present without appreciable change since ___. Elevation of the right lung base is more pronounced now than it was previously, which could be due to increase component of subpulmonic pleural effusion, but I think the diaphragm is elevated on that side, perhaps by subphrenic pathology, perhaps by phrenic nerve palsy. Heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged. Subcutaneous emphysema in the right lower thoracoabdominal wall and in the left neck has improved. Nasogastric tube passes to the distal esophagus and out of view. Right PIC line ends in the mid-to-low SVC. No pneumothorax.
