CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Right IJ, right subclavian, and left PICC lines are present, tips all over mid/distal No pneumothorax identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged. Previously seen right-sided chest tube is not appreciated on the current exam, but the lower right chest wall and right costophrenic angle are also excluded from film. The ET tube has been removed. There are moderate-to-moderately-large left and probable moderate right effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is upper zone redistribution and pulmonary vascular plethora. Compared with ___ at 00:48 a.m. and allowing for technical differences, vascular plethora is slightly worse and the left effusion may be very slightly larger. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
