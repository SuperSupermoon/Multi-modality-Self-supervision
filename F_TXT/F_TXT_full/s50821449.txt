Pleural catheter remains in place in the lower left hemithorax, and note is made of a very small left apical pneumothorax, slightly decreased in size from the prior radiograph. Bibasilar opacities have improved compared to the previous study. Small pleural effusions are again demonstrated, not appreciably changed on the right, but potentially slightly smaller on the left. Otherwise, no relevant changes since recent chest radiograph.
