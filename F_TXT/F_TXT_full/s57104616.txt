Rotated positioning. ET tube present, with tip the top of clavicles proximally 6.6 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, tip beneath diaphragm overlying gastric fundus. Portions of the tuber obscured by the patient's lumbar spine spinal fixation hardware. There is left-sided chest tube. No pneumothorax is detected. There is minimal hazy opacity at the left lung base, slightly increased. This is non-specific in appearance and could represent atelectasis, parenchymal contusion, or early pneumonic infiltrate. No gross effusion. Allowing for overlying tubing and materials, the right lung is grossly clear, without overt CHF, focal consolidation, or effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged.
