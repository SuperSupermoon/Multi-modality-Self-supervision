Large opacity projecting over the left mid to lower hemi thorax is again seen, worrisome for pleural effusion and overlying atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema is again seen. Increased patchy right basilar opacity may be due to atelectasis or aspiration given short term development. Difficult to exclude a small right pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged although not well assessed on the left due to the large left-sided opacity. No pneumothorax seen.
