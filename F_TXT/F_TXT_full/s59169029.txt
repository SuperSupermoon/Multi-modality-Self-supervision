AP portable supine view of the chest was provided. There is irregular opacity at the left lung base which could represent a very early pneumonia versus atelectasis/scarring. The lungs appear lucent in the upper lobes, likely reflecting emphysema. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. Bony structures are intact. No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
