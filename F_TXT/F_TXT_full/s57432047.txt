Endotracheal tube is 3.5 cm above the carina. The enteric tube is within the esophagus but appears to terminate at the gastroesophageal junction. Exact position could be determined with an abdominal radiograph if necessary. Extensive carotid calcifications are noted. Multifocal opacities within the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe, are consistent with pneumonia. Sutures and scarring are seen in the left upper lung, likely from prior surgery. The heart is mildly enlarged and there is mild pulmonary edema. There are small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
