There has been interval removal of an endotracheal tube and enteric tube. A right internal jugular sheath terminates in the upper SVC. The heart is markedly enlarged, but largely stable from the prior examination. There is a small to moderate right effusion and increased opacity throughout the right lung which may reflect atelectasis or mild edema. There is marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with left basal pulmonary opacity, likely compressive atelectasis. No pneumothorax is seen.
