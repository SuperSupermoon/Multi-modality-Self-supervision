Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent moderate-sized left pleural effusion with collapse of the left lower lobe, and associated leftward shift of the mediastinum and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. The right lung is clear. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach with the last sideport just below the GE junction. The endotracheal tube ends 3.1 cm from the carina.
