Patient is status post median sternotomy, CABG, and aortic valve replacement. There is mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Bibasilar opacities are seen which are nonspecific but could be due to aspiration or infection. Alternately there may also be small pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation. Prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature suggests pulmonary vascular engorgement. The cardiac silhouette is top-normal to mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified.
