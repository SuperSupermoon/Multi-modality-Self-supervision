A bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval clearance of the large right pleural effusion with diffuse opacification of the right middle and lower lobes, likely secondary to re-expansion atelectasis. There is now a new small left pleural effusion which was not present four days ago. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly is stable. Interval widening of the upper mediastinal silhouette secondary to central venous engorgement is suggestive of hypervolemia. There is no pulmonary edema. A right chest wall central venous catheter is appropriately positioned in the lower SVC. The right chest tube is also appropriately positioned, in the right lower pleural space, including the side port.
