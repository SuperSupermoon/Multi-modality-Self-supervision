Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Patchy and linear opacities at both bases are suggestive of atelectasis. Possible small left pleural effusion, but no visible pneumothorax. Previously present free intraperitoneal air is not visualized, possibly due to differences in patient positioning as the current exam was performed in a semi-upright rather than fully upright position. A questionable left upper lobe nodule versus rib lesion at level of the second anterior left rib is unchanged since recent chest radiograph, and a CT has previously been recommended with communication documented in the prior report under clip ___.
