A frontal supine view of the chest was obtained portably. Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding. Part of the lung fields are obscured by bilateral pacemakers. The endotracheal tube ends 4.3 cm above the carina. Opacity at the left lung base may represent a small effusion and atelectasis or infection. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate due to the left lung opacity. The upper lung zones are clear. No large pneumothorax. A nasogastric tube follows the expected course, although the tip is not visualized, possibly in the proximal duodenum.
