In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a left chest tube following vats decortication. There is still extensive opacification in the left hemithorax, though some aerated lung is seen. Again there is some shift of the mediastinum to the right. At the right base, there is now a dense streak of atelectasis and blunting of the costophrenic angle that could reflect a small effusion.
