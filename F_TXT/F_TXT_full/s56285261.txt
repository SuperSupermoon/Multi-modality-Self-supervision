Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is an enteric tube which is deviated to the right side, likely related to the esophagectomy. The side port is at the GE junction. The distal tip is in the fundus of the stomach. There is a chest tube projecting over the right lung base. A second chest tube is seen at the left lung base. Heart size is enlarged and there is prominence of mediastinum. An air filled structure in the right lower mid chest is likely the neoesophagus.
