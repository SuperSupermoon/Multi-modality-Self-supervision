Large right and moderate left pleural effusion obscures much of the lungs, but there does appear to have been substantial improvement in previous mild edema and pulmonary vascular engorgement. The heart is normal size. Mediastinal veins are not distended. Bibasilar atelectasis is probably quite severe. No pneumothorax. ET tube in standard placement. Esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right jugular lines end at the origin of the SVC.
