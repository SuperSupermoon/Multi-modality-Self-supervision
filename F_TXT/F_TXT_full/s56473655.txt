1. Spinal hardware is again seen obscuring some of the detail. A right internal jugular central line continues to have its tip unchanged in position likely in the distal SVC. An endotracheal tube is in position with its tip approximately 2 cm above the carina. Once again, the patient is markedly rotated left limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours. There has been interval improvement in aeration in the left upper and mid lung but there is still likely lower lobe collapse. A superimposed infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. There also possibly is a layering left effusion. The right lung remains grossly clear. No pneumothorax is seen.
