CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. There is slightly rotated positioning. An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately a 4.3 cm above the carina. A right IJ line is present, tip over distal SVC. Multiple lines and tubing overlie the chest. Again seen is marked cardiomegaly. In this setting, the presence of a pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF and interstitial edema. Probable moderate right and small-to-moderate left effusions, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Compared with ___ at 3:09 a.m. and allowing for differences in positioning, I doubt significant interval change.
