As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 6 cm above the carina, the tube could be advanced by 1-2 cm. The patient also has a nasogastric tube. The tube ends in the mid esophagus and needs to be advanced by at least ___-15 cm. No evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. Likely as a result from increased ventilatory pressure, bilateral areas of parenchymal opacities, previously seen and combined to small areas of pleural effusions, have overall decreased in extent.
