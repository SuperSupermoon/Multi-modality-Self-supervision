Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged, this could be due to the projection. Large bilateral effusions have minimally increased, though the difference could be just due to difference in positioning of the patient. Adjacent opacities in the lower lobes, left greater than right, are consistent with atelectasis. Tracheostomy tube is in the standard position. Left subclavian catheter tip is in the cavoatrial junction. There is no evident pneumothorax.
