Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates well expanded lungs. Increased opacification of the retrocardiac space is consistent with atelectasis. There has been interval resolution of pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The heart remains enlarged. A left ventricular assist device is in the expected position. The Swan-Ganz catheter remains in place with the tip in the right pulmonary artery. There has been interval removal of the nasogastric tube, endotracheal tube, left-sided chest tube, and intra-aortic balloon pump. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
