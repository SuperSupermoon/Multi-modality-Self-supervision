In comparison with the study of ___, the left IJ catheter tip remains in the lower portion of the SVC. There is little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs with mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Elevation of the indistinct right hemidiaphragm is consistent with effusion and atelectasis on this side. Minimal atelectasis at the left base.
