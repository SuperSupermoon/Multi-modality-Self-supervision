Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___:03. Slight interval improvement in pulmonary edema, superimposed on fibrosing NSIP. Moderate cardiomegaly improved slightly. Pleural effusions small if any. Substantial subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall and neck, new since ___:30 on ___, stable since ___:00. No pneumothorax or clear pneumomediastinum. Although this could be due to barotrauma, I am told the patient's pulmonary status improved and positive pressure ventilator support was decreased during the preceding day. Clinical consideration should be given to trauma or complications involving the upper airway or esophagus. Indwelling right internal jugular central venous line comment ET tube, and transesophageal drainage tree overall in standard placements unchanged.
