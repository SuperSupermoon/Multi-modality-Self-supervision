No previous images. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits normal or mildly enlarged and there is evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure with small effusions and atelectatic changes at the bases. Left subclavian pacer is in place with leads extending to the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle. No evidence of post procedure pneumothorax. Suggestion of more coalescent area of opacification at the right base could reflect developing consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting. There are surgical clips in the left axillary region, consistent with the clinical history of prior mastectomy.
