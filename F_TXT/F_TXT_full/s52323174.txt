Allowing for technical differences, there may have been slight improvement in CHF findings. Otherwise, doubt significant interval change. ET tube tip lies 4.6 cm above the carina. NG tube tip extends beneath diaphragm overlying the upper stomach. The sideport lies in the region of the GE junction, probably slightly distal to it. There is mild cardiomegaly. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF, with possible slight interval improvement. Retrocardiac opacities improved, though remains faintly present, with suggestion of air bronchograms, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. No gross effusion. No pneumothorax detected. Fixation hardware of the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine again noted.
