As compared to the previous radiograph, the chest tube has been slightly pulled back and the tip projects more cranial than on the previous examination. The effusion component of the pre-existing left abnormality has slightly increased, as has the atelectasis at the left lung base. There is currently no evidence for a left pneumothorax. On the right, the effusion has slightly decreased and, as a consequence, the areas of basal atelectasis are also smaller than previously. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
