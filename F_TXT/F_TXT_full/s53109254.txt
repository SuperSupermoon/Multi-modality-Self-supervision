There is a consolidation of the right lower lobe, with a more patchy opacity in the mid lung field accompanied by a moderate pleural effusion in this side. The right hemidiaphragm is obscured but the right heart border is well defined. There is a patchy opacity also in the left lower lung field, but no blunting of the left costophrenic angle. There is stable moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral hilar prominence and vascular upper redistribution. The mediastinal contour is unremarkable and there is no pneumothorax. A pacemaker generator is noted in the left axilla with the leads ending in expected positions in the right atrium and right ventricle.
