1. Interval extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube. Interval removal of several of the mediastinal drains. Bibasilar chest tubes and right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip in the pulmonary outflow tract are stable. 2. Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative cardiac and mediastinal contours. There continues to be patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflecting moderate pulmonary edema, which is essentially unchanged, although a diffuse pneumonia cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. Relative density of the ribs raises concern for sclerotic metastases, for which clinical correlation is advised. No pneumothorax or pleural effusions.
