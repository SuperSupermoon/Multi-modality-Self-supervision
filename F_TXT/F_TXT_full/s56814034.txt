NG tube tip is in the lower esophagus, should be advanced to more standard position. ET tube is in standard position, the tip is approximately 6.8 cm above the carina. Cardiac size is top normal. Sternal wires are aligned. The patient is status post CABG. There is no pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions associated with adjacent atelectases are larger on the left side. Extensive opacity in the right lung with a consolidative pattern in the right lower lobe and nodular opacities in the periphery of the right lung are associated with interstitial opacities and haziness of the vessels. These opacities could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema that could be associated with atelectasis in the right lower lobe. Hazy opacity in the right upper lobe could be due to aspiration. In the left lung, there is irregularity of the left perihilar region and there are multiple plate-like atelectases or scarring in the left mid lung; these are of unknown chronicity. Given the constellation of findings and not clear explanation of the nodular opacities in the right lung, CT is recommended for better evaluation of the lung parenchyma and evaluation of the left ___. Findings discussed with Dr ___ by phone, ___ at 2.___ pm
