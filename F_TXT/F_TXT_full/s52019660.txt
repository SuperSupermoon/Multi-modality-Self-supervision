The ET tube and left subclavian line are unchanged. The feeding tube is still located too high, in the proximal stomach. There is increase in retrocardiac opacity with a left effusion and hazy opacities in both lower lobes. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution. The overall impression is that of a worsened fluid status.
