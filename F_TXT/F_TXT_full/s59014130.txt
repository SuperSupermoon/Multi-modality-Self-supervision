AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. Tracheostomy is in place, slightly pointed towards the right and with the tip being 3.5 cm above the carina. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged including cardiomegaly. Vascular engorgement and mild interstitial engorgement are noted most likely consistent with mild interstitial edema.
