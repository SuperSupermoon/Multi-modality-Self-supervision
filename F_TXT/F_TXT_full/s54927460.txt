Comparison is made with prior study ___. There are unchanged low lung volumes and diffuse interstitial opacities consistent with patient's known pulmonary fibrosis. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There are no new lung abnormalities. The main pulmonary arteries are enlarged consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Suspected mild interstitial edema is stable. Minimally increased opacity in the left lower lobe is consistent with atelectasis.
