AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Similar as on the preceding examination of ___, the patient is tilting towards the right. The previously identified minimal apical pneumothorax on the left side has further reduced and is less than 1 cm. Thus left lung appears well aerated and expanded. Bilateral basal pleural effusion remain rather unchanged. No new parenchymal abnormalities.
