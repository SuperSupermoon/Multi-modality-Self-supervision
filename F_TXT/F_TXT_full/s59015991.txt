CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. A right-sided PICC line is present, tip overlying mid/distal SVC. A left-sided dual-lumen catheter is present, tips overlying SVC/RA junction and RA. No pneumothorax is identified. There are low inspiratory volumes. There is cardiomegaly with vascular plethora and vascular blurring, though these findings are likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. There is increased opacity at the right base, which could represent a combination of pleural fluid, elevated hemidiaphragm, and underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There is also pleural thickening and/or fluid at the right lung apex. Sutures noted about the right hilum. The left costophrenic sulcus is clear. Compared with ___, findings at the right base are similar. There is slightly less opacity at the right apex. The CHF findings may be slightly worse.
