AP portable upright chest radiograph was obtained. The left lung is relatively well expanded. Increased opacity of the right lower lung is likely a combination of small to moderate size pleural effusion and consolidation. Minimal retrocardiac opacity may also be present. There is no pneumothorax or left pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal contours and heart size are unremarkable.
