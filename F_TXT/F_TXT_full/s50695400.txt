The ETT appears to be high terminating 8 cm above the carina, which is unchanged in comparison to the prior radiograph. There is a left PICC line with the tip terminating in the low SVC. There is a right IJ ECMO cannula, which appears unchanged in comparison to the prior radiograph. There is improved aeration of the lower lobes bilaterally, although there is a persistent combination of bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. The upper lungs appear clear bilaterally. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax.
