As compared to the previous radiograph, there has been interval removal of an endotracheal tube and an enteric catheter. Right-sided central venous catheter is stable in position. Comparative evaluation is limited due to patient's rotation. Relatively stable left lower lobe opacity, likely representing a combination of atelectasis and effusion. Right lower lobe opacity is not significantly changed as compared to the previous radiograph, no evidence of pneumothorax. Unchanged cardiomediastinal contours.
