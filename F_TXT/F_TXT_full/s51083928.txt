Single supine portable radiograph through the chest was obtained. External trauma board somewhat limits evaluation. Lung volumes are low bilaterally. No focal consolidation is identified. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. No large pleural effusion is seen. The right apex is out of the field of view. Allowing for this, no pneumothorax is seen. Osseous structures are without acute abnormality.
