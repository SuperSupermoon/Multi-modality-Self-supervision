Comparison to ___. The patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube was removed. The right internal jugular vein catheter is in stable position. Stable low lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No pleural effusions. The right lung basis appears better ventilated than on the previous image but an indistinct increase in radiodensity at the level of the right upper lobe persists. Short term followup should be performed to exclude developing right upper lobe pneumonia.
