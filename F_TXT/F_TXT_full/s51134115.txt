The endotracheal tube is again seen approximately 3 cm above the carina. A left subclavian central venous catheter is unchanged in position and terminates in the mid to low SVC. A nasogastric tube is within the stomach but contains a hairpin turn which may cause kinking. The tip is likely in the antrum. An unidentified additional line with a radiopaque cylinder overlies the neck adjacent to the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes, and was not present on the prior radiograph. It is likely external to the patient. An area of linear atelectasis in the right lower lung is more prominent than on the prior study. The well-expanded lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The hilar and cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. The patient has had a past wedge resection of the right lung.
