The lungs are well expanded. Multiple patchy opacities throughout the right lung are compatible with known pleural metastasis. Chain sutures in the right upper lung are re-demonstrated, consistent with prior wedge resection. A focal nodularity seen in the left apex was compared with prior CT and corresponds to a focus of fibrosis/scarring. No focal opacities are seen in the right lung concerning for pneumonia. Cardiac size is normal. There is a tortuous aorta with atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic wall, unchanged. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. An IVC filter is partially imaged.
