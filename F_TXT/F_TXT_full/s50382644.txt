As compared to the previous radiograph, the left PICC line is now in correct position. The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the mid to low SVC. No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The patient remains intubated, with the tip of the endotracheal tube projecting approximately 3 cm above the carinal. The course and position of the nasogastric tube is unchanged. Lower lung volumes than on the previous examination but no evidence of overt pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Moderate atelectasis at the right lung basis.
