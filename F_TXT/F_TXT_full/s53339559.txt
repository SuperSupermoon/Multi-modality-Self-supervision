Mild generalized interstitial abnormality has improved minimally since ___ when the patient also had transient pneumonia, aspiration, or pulmonary hemorrhage in the left lung. There is no consolidation currently. The appearance of the persistent interstitial lung disease raises concern about the immunocompetence of the patient and possibility of chronic or recurrent recurrent interstitial pneumonia, including PCP. Heart size is normal. There is no pleural abnormality. The mild widening, shape, and homogeneity of upper mediastinal contents suggest adenopathy, perhaps increased slightly. A more complete clinical history and review of any prior chest CT scanning would be necessary to see if CT scanning would provide clinically useful information now.
