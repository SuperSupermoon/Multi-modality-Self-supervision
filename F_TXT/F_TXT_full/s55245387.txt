Comparison is made to the previous study from ___. The heart size is upper limits of normal. There are low lung volumes due to poor inspiratory effort. There is some crowding of the vascular markings, especially around the right hila, and underlying infiltrate in this area is not entirely excluded. This could be better assessed with PA and lateral radiograph. There is coarsening of the bronchovascular markings; however, no overt pulmonary edema is seen. There are no pneumothoraces identified.
