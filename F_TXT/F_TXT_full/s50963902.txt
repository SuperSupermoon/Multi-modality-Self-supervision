The patient has been extubated in the interim, which has resulted in lower lung volumes and increased atelectasis in the right lower lobe. Opacity at the left lung base is likely atelectasis , unchanged. Mediastinal and pleural drains have been removed. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. No pneumothorax. The heart remains mildly enlarged, however, there is no pulmonary edema. Emphysema predominantly upper lobes. Cervical ribs are noted. Left pectoral pacemaker, sternotomy wires and a mitral valve prosthesis are constant. The right internal jugular catheter courses into the mid SVC.
