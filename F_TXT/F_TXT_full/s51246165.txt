1. Interval removal of two left chest tubes with one remaining in place having its tip at the left apex. There is increasing opacification in the left mid to lower lung with some residual aerated lung at the left apex. These findings most likely reflect increasing partial lobar atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. The right lung has somewhat decreased in volume, but is grossly clear. The cardiac and mediastinal contours remain stably enlarged given patient rotation on the current exam. There is a stable small left apical pneumothorax. Crowding of the pulmonary vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema.
