There are low lung volumes that may be due to poor inspiratory effort. Suboptimal evaluation of the left lung base. There is opacification in this area but is likely due to overlying soft tissue edema. A small pleural effusion cannot be completely excluded. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. The pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.
