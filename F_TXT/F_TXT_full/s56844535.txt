As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The monitoring and support devices are constant. Unchanged left pleural effusion with subsequent areas of relatively extensive atelectasis. Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged minimal right pleural effusion with homogeneous increase in radiolucency of the right hemithorax. No evidence of focal parenchymal opacity in the ventilated parts of the lung parenchyma that could suggest pneumonia.
