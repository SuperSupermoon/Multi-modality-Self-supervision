Assessment is slightly limited by patient rotation. Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the right atrium. Heart size is moderately enlarged. The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise grossly unremarkable. No pulmonary edema is seen. Patchy retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis. Lungs appear hyperinflated. Small left pleural effusion may be present. No pneumothorax is identified. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
