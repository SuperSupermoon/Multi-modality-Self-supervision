AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. During the interval, a left-sided small-caliber tube was placed on the left base entering lower lateral chest wall and progressing along the diaphragmatic contour towards the midline. Special high-contrast copy illustrates this finding in spite of the general increased basal soft tissue densities related to patient's sitting position. In comparison with the previous study, the amount of pleural density has decreased, indicating successful drainage. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area of the lungs. The previously present cardiomegaly persists and the pulmonary vascular pattern is compatible with chronic congestion. No new discrete parenchymal infiltrates can be identified.
