The heart size is mildly enlarged, slightly increased from prior. There are bilateral interstitial opacities, consistent with mild pulmonary edema. A small left pleural effusion is unchanged. Overlying opacities presumably atelectasis, although, pneumonia would have to be considered in the correct clinical setting. The mediastinum is unremarkable.
