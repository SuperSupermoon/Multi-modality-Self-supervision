Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. There is slight prominence of the left hilum, and underlying prominent lymph nodes or small consolidation is not excluded. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further evaluation.
