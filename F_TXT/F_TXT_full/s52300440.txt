As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a tracheostomy tube. The nasogastric tube remains in place, as does the right-sided PICC line. The signs indicative of pulmonary edema have decreased. At the right lung base, plate-like atelectasis has newly appeared. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No larger pleural effusions are visualized.
