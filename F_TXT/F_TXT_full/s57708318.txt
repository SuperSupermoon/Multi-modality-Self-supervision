Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement are pronounced but there is no pulmonary edema. Mediastinal venous distension is long-standing, not as severe as it was on ___ when the patient was also in mild pulmonary edema. The intrathoracic stomach, traversing a chronic hiatus hernia, projects to the right of the cardiac silhouette. Moderate right pleural effusion is larger. The combination of intrathoracic stomach and pleural effusion obscures the right lower lobe, but both lung bases are poorly aerated and could contain pneumonia.
