As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in appearance of the Swan-Ganz catheter. Also, the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are constant in appearance. The lung volumes have minimally increased, potentially reflecting an increase in ventilatory pressures. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities are unchanged in extent and severity.
