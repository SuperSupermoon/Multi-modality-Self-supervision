The previously seen right apical pneumothorax has decreased significantly in size. A tiny residual right apical pneumothorax remains present. CHF findings are slightly improved. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Catheters or leads are seen adjacent to the lower portion of both right and left hemithorax these. Clinical correlation requested for further assessment.
