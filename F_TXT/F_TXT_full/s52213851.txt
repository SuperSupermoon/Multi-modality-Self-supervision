AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained 1 hour and 20 minutes earlier. The patient is intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea some 4 cm above the level of the carina. As before, a tiny right apical pleural separation indicates a residual pneumothorax which does not show tension or increase. Metallic grid structures of cor valve prosthesis is noted in place, unchanged in position. Heart size has not increased and the pulmonary vasculature is not congested. Previously identified right subclavian approach central venous line and right-sided chest tube with pigtail end configuration and mediastinal drainage line advanced from below as before.
