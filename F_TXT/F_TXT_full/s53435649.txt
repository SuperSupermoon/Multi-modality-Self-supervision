The patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 3.5 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube can be followed into the stomach, although its termination point is not imaged, located beyond the inferior margin of the film. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The lungs appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
