Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given lordotic technique. The aorta is unfolded and tortuous. Lungs are slightly diminished in volume but grossly clear. No evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
