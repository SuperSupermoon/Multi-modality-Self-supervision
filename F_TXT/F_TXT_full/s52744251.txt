The lower most left chest and left costophrenic angle are excluded from the film. The patient is imaged with his left arm raised. The lungs are moderately well inflated. The heart may be slightly enlarged, but the cardiomediastinal silhouette unchanged, with minimal unfolding of the aorta and aortic calcification noted. No CHF, focal infiltrate, right pleural effusion, or gross left pleural effusion is identified. No pneumothorax detected. Linear hyper density projecting over the lingula is not significantly changed dating back to ___. Limited assessment of the upper abdomen shows residual contrast in the colon. Equivocal hyperlucency could be an artifact due to overlapping loops of bowel. No free air seen beneath the diaphragm.
