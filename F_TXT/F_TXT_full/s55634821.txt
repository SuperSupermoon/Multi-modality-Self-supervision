As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal improvement in ventilation of the right than left lung base. The lung volumes, however, remain low and bilateral small pleural effusions are visualized. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. The monitoring and support devices are constant. However, given the different projection, a loop of the esophageal device is now visualized at the upper aspect 's of the image. The loop could represent a coiling in the pharynx and should be assessed clinically.
