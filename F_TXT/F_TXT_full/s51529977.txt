Increasing left basilar opacity may be secondary to interval aspiration or pneumonia. There is also a new small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. Increasing pleural fluid is also seen on the right, though small. There is ongoing pulmonary vascular congestion, similar to prior, though no overt interstitial edema. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. There is no pneumothorax.
