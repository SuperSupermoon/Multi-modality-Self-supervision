AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained seven and a half hours earlier during the same day.

The on previous examination existing basal haze on the right side has decreased and a local basal air-fluid level is now identified indicating successful thoracocentesis diminishing right-sided pleural effusion which was partially layered in posterior pleural compartments in this patient in almost supine position. Left hemithorax remains unaltered. There is no evidence of any pneumothorax in the apical area. Position of NG tube unchanged.
