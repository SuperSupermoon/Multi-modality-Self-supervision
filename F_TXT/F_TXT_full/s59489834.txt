Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There are low lung volumes. Mild cardiomegaly is new. Increasing asymmetric opacities in the right perihilar region could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Right small-to-moderate pleural effusion has minimally increased allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. NG tube tip is in the fundus of the stomach. There is persistent dilatation of the visualized colon in the upper abdomen.
