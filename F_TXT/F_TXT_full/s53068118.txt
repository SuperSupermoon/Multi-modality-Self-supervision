There is an unchanged left-sided AICD with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. The cardiac silhouette is unchanged and mildly enlarged with a mildly tortuous aorta. There is a silhouette sign of the descending aorta, consistent with either volume loss or consolidation, both of which have been described in DRESS. No pneumothorax is identified.
