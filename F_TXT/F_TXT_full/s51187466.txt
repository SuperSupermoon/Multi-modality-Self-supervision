As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. As a consequence, there is a minimal increase in radiodensity at the left and right lung bases, likely reflecting local atelectasis. No pleural effusions. No pneumonia. The monitoring and support devices are constant, constant size of the cardiac silhouette.
