In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette given the AP portable view. No evidence of vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. The left hemidiaphragm is obscured and there is increased opacification in the retrocardiac region. This is consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. However, in the absence of a lateral view, progression of this process cannot be properly assessed.
