1. Interval extubation. Right internal jugular central line and left basilar chest tube remain in place. Lung volumes are lower on the current examination. There is patchy opacity at the left base with an associated effusion, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the low lung volumes and patient rotation on the current study, although the mediastinal contours are likely unchanged. Status post median sternotomy for CABG. No pneumothorax.
