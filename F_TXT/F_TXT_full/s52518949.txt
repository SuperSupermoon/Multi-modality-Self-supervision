1. Interval exchange of a feeding tube for a nasogastric tube with the tube seen coursing below the diaphragm but the tip not definitely identified due to technique and patient's body habitus. A dedicated abdominal film to confirm the position of the nasogastric tube may be helpful prior to clinical use as it is not clear where the sideport lies. Left subclavian PICC line remains in place. Persistent bilateral layering effusions with interval worsening of bilateral airspace process likely reflecting worsening pulmonary edema. There is likely bibasilar compressive atelectasis associated with the effusions. Heart remains stably enlarged. No pneumothorax is seen. Results were communicated to the patient's nurse, ___, by phone on ___ at 10:20 a.m.
