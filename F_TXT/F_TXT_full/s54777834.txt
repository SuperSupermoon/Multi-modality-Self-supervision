Since a recent study of several hr earlier, the patient has been intubated, with endotracheal tube terminating 2.8 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube has been placed, coursing below the diaphragm. New patchy areas of increased opacity have developed in the right upper and both lower lobes, and may be due to multifocal aspiration and/or atelectasis.
