There has been interval placement of a left-sided subclavian central venous catheter with tip projecting over the mid SVC. No pneumothorax is identified. An endotracheal tube and an esophageal catheter are in unchanged position. Again seen are diffuse ill-defined bibasilar opacities, as well as more reticular opacities with bronchiectasis consistent with chronic fibrotic change. No significant pleural effusion is seen. The heart size is normal.
