As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.5 cm above the carinal. The Swan-Ganz catheter is still far to low within the right lower lobe periphery and should be pulled back by approximately 7-8 cm. Newly developed left retrocardiac atelectasis, potentially combined to a small left pleural effusion. The course of a newly inserted nasogastric tube is unremarkable, the tip projects over the middle parts of the stomach. The previously placed intra-aortic balloon pump is no longer visible.
