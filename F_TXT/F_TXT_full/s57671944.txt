In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Tracheostomy tube remains in place. There is again diffuse cardiomediastinal widening, which apparently reflects a combination of mediastinal lipomatosis as well as distended vascular structures. There is moderate pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacifications are consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. The possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate setting. The right PICC line appears to have been removed.
