There is a right pleural effusion which is unchanged since prior exam. Again seen is a right hilar opacity consistent with fibrosis, better assessed on recent CT. A subtle left lower lobe opacity is seen, which may represent atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be excluded. The lungs are otherwise clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from prior exam. Visualized osseus structures are unremarkable.
