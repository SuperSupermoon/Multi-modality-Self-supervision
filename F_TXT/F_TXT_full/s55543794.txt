Cardiac silhouette size is normal. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic arch. There is mild perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Additionally moderate size layering bilateral pleural effusions are relatively similar compared to the prior examination. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect compressive atelectasis. Marked degenerative changes of the left glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint are noted along with multilevel degenerative changes in the imaged thoracic spine.
