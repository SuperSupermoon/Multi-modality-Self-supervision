Single upright image of the chest demonstrates an elevated left hemidiaphragm with small left base opacification likely representing atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly is seen. There is a minimally dilated aorta which follows a tortuous course compatible with the patient's advanced age.
