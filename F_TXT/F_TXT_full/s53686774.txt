ET tube remains in good position. There is an upper alimentary tube whose tip is not seen, but appears to be coiled towards its distal end. Bilateral diffuse airspace opacities are much improved on this study, but slight increased markings in the bilateral upper lobes and the right lower lobe are still present. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
