Status post median sternotomy and CABG. Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic knob. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour may be due to the presence of mediastinal fat and slightly low lung volumes. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures likely attributable to low lung volumes without overt pulmonary edema. Persistent small to moderate size left pleural effusion is present with left basilar opacification likely reflective of compressive atelectasis. Mild interstitial abnormality in the right lower lobe likely reflects chronic changes and atelectasis. No pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
