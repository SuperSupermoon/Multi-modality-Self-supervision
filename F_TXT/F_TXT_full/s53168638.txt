In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 2 hours prior, there is been interval placement of a left-sided IJ central venous catheter which terminates near the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC. An enteric tube terminates within the gastric body. Bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis, although there is some asymmetry with increased opacification at the left base and a small pleural effusion, possibly suggesting the presence of a pneumonia. Mild cardiomegaly is mildly increased, but without pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes are otherwise normal.
