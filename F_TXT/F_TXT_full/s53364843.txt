AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 4:48 a.m.: ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placements respectively. Opacification in the left lower hemithorax is due exclusively to pneumonia. Although small left pleural effusion may have developed, that is not necessarily the case, and there appears to be more consolidation extending superiorly to the level of the hilus. Small regions of infection in the right lung more evident on CT scanning than conventional radiographs. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax.
