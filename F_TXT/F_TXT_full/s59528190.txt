Single portable view of the chest. No prior. Lungs are clear of confluent consolidation. There is indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature. Calcification projects over the right lung apex, potentially calcified granuloma or potentially vascular in nature. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
