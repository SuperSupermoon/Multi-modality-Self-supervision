Patient is status post left upper lobectomy with clips noted in the left hilar region and evidence of left sided volume loss including mild rightward shift of mediastinal structures and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Low lung volumes are present. The cardiac silhouette size is slightly increased from the prior study, but this is likely due to supine positioning and low lung volumes. Similarly, the mediastinal contour superiorly appears somewhat widened, but again this is likely due to technique and low lung volumes. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures, but no pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
