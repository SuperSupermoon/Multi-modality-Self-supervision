AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. The heart size appears to be unchanged, somewhat greater heart size on this portable examination is explained by examination technique. Patient's inspirational effort appears to be lower than on previous examination. Diaphragms still can be identified well and there is no evidence of new pleural effusion as the lateral pleural sinuses remain free. The previously described multiple peripherally located linear parenchymal densities, most marked in left lower lobe area and mid to upper portion of right hemithorax appear rather unchanged. No new abnormalities are seen and no pneumothorax is present.
