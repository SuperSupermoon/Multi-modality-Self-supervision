A tracheostomy tube is in place. There are low inspiratory volumes. Again seen are somewhat patchy densities at both lung bases. At the right base, the opacity is slightly more confluent. At the left base, there may be slightly improved aeration. Doubt overt CHF. No gross effusion. No pneumothorax detected. Prominent patchy osteopenia noted in both proximal humeri.
