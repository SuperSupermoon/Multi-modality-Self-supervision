Right internal jugular catheter ends at SVC. Orogastric feeding tube is seen to course below the diaphragm into the stomach, however distal end is beyond the view of radiograph. Bilateral lung volumes are low. Lower lung atelectasis and presumed small left pleural effusion is unchanged. Given the low lung volumes, assessment for mild or early pulmonary edema is limited.
