The cardiomediastinal silhouettes are within normal limits. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. Irregular opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle likely represents combination of basal atelectasis in conjunction with crowding of bronchovascular structures in the setting of low lung volumes. Otherwise, the lungs are clear. There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Evidence of multiple old left posterolateral rib fractures, at least involving ribs 6, 7, and 8, are noted.
