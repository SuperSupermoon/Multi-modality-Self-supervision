As compared to the previous radiograph, the widespread parenchymal opacities, diffusely distributed in both lungs, have moderately decreased in extent and severity but clearly remain visible. Small pleural effusions, right more than left, have also decreased but likewise are still present. Mild retrocardiac atelectasis persists.
