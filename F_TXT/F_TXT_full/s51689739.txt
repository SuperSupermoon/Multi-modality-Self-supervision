As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing and pre-described right lower lobe pneumonia has substantially increased in extent and severity. There now is a large area of parenchymal consolidation at the right lung bases, potentially associated with a small right pleural effusion. The size of the cardiac silhouette is minimally enlarged. The retrocardiac atelectasis has newly occurred. Unchanged tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pneumothorax.
