Enteric tube traverses the midline. Left PICC line ends in the mid SVC. Surgical hardware in the thoracic spine projects over the mid thorax and limits evaluation of underlying structures. Aeration of the lungs has improved but lung volumes remain low. Bilateral atelectasis persists. No definite pleural effusion. The heart is normal in size, unchanged. Minimal bilateral edema. No pneumothorax. Opacity projecting over the right upper lung likely reflects prior rib injury. Gaseous distention of the colon in the left upper quadrant is similar to previous exam.
