Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Right pigtail pleural catheter has apparently been removed since the prior study, and a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has slightly increased in size. Multifocal linear scar versus atelectasis in the right lung appears unchanged. Linear scarring versus atelectasis in the periphery of the left upper lobe also appears similar compared to the prior study.
