Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Diffuse lung opacities have increased. Previously noted abnormalities are due to infection though there is a component of mild pulmonary edema. The consolidations have increased in the upper lobe mainly. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There are low lung volumes. The small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Right central catheter tip is in the lower SVC.
