Interval extubation. Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by an asymmetrical pulmonary edema pattern affecting the right lung to a greater degree than the left, which remains less severe than on the initial presentation radiographs of ___. Multifocal nodular opacities are present, predominantly in the right hemithorax, and could potentially be related to multifocal infection, although at least some of these could be due to exuberant callus formation at previous rib fracture sites. Dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs may be helpful for more complete evaluation when the patient's condition permits.
