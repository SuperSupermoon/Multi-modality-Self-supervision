Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval improvement in the degree of bilateral parenchymal opacities, with clearing at the bilateral apices, right greater than left. Small right-sided pleural effusion persists. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. A right-sided internal jugular central venous line ends at the distal SVC. The endotracheal tube ends 3.8 cm from the carina. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view. No pneumothorax.
