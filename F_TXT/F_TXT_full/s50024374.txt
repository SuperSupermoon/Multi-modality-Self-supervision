The endotracheal tube ends at the level of the clavicles. An NG tube terminates in the stomach. A right PICC line is unchanged in position, ending in the mid SVC. Moderate right has slightly increased, but the small left layering pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Heart size appears slightly larger, which may be due to a combination of poor inspiration and pleural fluid.
