The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to pleural thickening or very trace pleural effusion. Subtle right base opacity is felt to be due to overlap of vascular structures rather than true focal consolidation. This could be further assessed on PA and lateral views of the chest. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable with slight prominence of the main pulmonary artery which can be seen with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Aortic knob is calcified. Prominent right hilum is stable.
