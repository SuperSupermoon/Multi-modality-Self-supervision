Small right apical and basilar pneumothorax is not significantly changed compared to the most recent radiograph from ___. The previously seen small caliber right pleural catheter on the prior chest radiograph is no longer identified. There are two new larger bore pleural catheters projecting over the right lung base. There has been interval improvement of the small right-sided pleural effusion. The left lung is clear without evidence of focal consolidations. There is mild right basilar atelectasis. The hilar and mediastinal contours are normal.
