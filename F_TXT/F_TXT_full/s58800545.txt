Esophageal stent straddles the gastroesophageal junction, approximately 10 cm above and 3.5 cm below. There is mild narrowing of the stent in the distal third. Substantial increase in opacification of both lower lungs medially could be due to atelectasis or aspiration. Pleural effusion is small if any. Upper lungs are clear. Heart size top-normal. Central infusion catheter ends in the low SVC. No pneumothorax.
