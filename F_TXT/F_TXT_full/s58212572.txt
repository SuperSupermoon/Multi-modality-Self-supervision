The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Patchy opacities are demonstrated within both lung bases, which appear somewhat progressed compared to the previous exam. This could reflect areas of infection and/or atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated though the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. No pulmonary edema is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Right PICC has been removed.
