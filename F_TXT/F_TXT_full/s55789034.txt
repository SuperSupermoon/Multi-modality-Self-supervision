In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with intact midline sternal wires. No definite vascular congestion. There is increased opacification at the right base medially. This could represent merely crowding of vessels combined with atelectasis. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. The left hemidiaphragm is relatively well seen, though there may well be some atelectatic change involving the left lower lobe.
