CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position above the carina. An NG tube is present, extending beneath the diaphragm off the film. A left subclavian central line is present, tip over mid SVC. Compared with ___ at 10:41 a.m., the bilateral chest tubes have been removed. No pneumothorax is identified. There is patchy opacity at the left base with a small left effusion and patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, overall similar to the earlier film. Slight differences in appearance may relate to differences in positioning. Axillary surgical clips noted.
