As compared to ___ chest radiograph, endotracheal tube continues to terminate above the thoracic inlet level, approximately 7.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach, and an adjacent esophageal catheter terminates at the gastroesophageal junction. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema and mild pneumomediastinum are again demonstrated. . Prominent lucency surrounding the right hemidiaphragm contour and extending deep into the right costophrenic sulcus, as well as a newly apparent linear lucency along the left lateral abdominal contour raise possibility of right basilar pneumothorax and free intraperitoneal air respectively. Left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen could be obtained to to better assess these findings. Widespread pulmonary opacities have slightly worsened in the interval.
