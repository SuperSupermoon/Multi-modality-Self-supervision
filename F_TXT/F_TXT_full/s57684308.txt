Multiple left-sided rib fractures are again demonstrated. There is slight relative elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with worsened left lower lobe atelectasis, likely reflecting respiratory splinting. The overall inspiratory effort is slightly less in comparison to the prior examination. No pneumothorax is detected.
