Single portable view of the chest. Again seen is relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with blunting of the right lateral costophrenic angle, potentially due to small effusion. The lungs are clear of consolidation. Low lung volumes result in crowding of the bronchovascular markings. Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged but this is likely due to low lung volumes and portable technique and is likely unchanged from prior. Degenerative changes are seen at the left shoulder. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant suggest prior cholecystectomy.
