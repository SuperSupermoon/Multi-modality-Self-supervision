Inspiratory volumes are slightly lower. Cardiomegaly is again seen, similar to prior. As before, there is increased retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Suspect small left effusion. There is also hazy opacity at the right base, an blunting of the right costophrenic angle, consistent with atelectasis and small effusion. There is vascular plethora, slightly more than on the prior exam. Note made again made of a dual-lumen right-sided catheter with lead tips over the right atrium an ___ dilute and a left-sided dual lead pacemaker, similar in configuration. No pneumothorax detected. Prominent rounded lucency overlying left cardiac silhouette is probably unchanged. No air was seen within the pericardium on the CT from ___. This likely represents air within the lung, adjacent to the heart.
