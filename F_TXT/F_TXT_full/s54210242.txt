1. Left basilar pigtail catheter and right PICC line remain unchanged in position. Interval reduction in lung volumes with persistent multifocal patchy opacities throughout the left lung. The right lung demonstrates patchy opacity at the base likely reflecting atelectasis. No large pneumothorax is seen. A left basilar chest tube remains in place as well. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient positioning and technique.
