New right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava just proximal to the expected location of the cavoatrial junction. There is no visible pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube has been withdrawn slightly, now terminating 6.8 cm above the carina, and a nasogastric tube coils within the stomach, with distal tip directed towards the GE junction level. Slight decrease in cardiac silhouette and vascular pedicle width, as well as slight improvement in predominantly perihilar opacities which likely represent pulmonary edema. Residual opacities are worse on the right than the left, and followup radiographs after diuresis would be helpful to exclude pneumonia given clinical suspicion for this entity. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present, with apparent improvement on the right.
