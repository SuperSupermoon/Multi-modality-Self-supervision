In comparison with the study ___ ___, on this less oblique view, the cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia. The endotracheal tube tip is approximately 4.4 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though the side port is above the esophagogastric junction. The tube should be pushed forward approximately 8-10 cm for more optimal positioning.
