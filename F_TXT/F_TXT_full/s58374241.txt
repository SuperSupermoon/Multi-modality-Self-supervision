Most or all of the left lower lobe is still collapsed. It is difficult to say whether relative hyperlucency of the left upper hemi thorax is due to hyperinflation of the superior segment or a pleural air collection. Moderate left pleural effusion is slightly larger, basal pleural tube still in place. Right lung is clear. Heart size is large, but difficult to assess because the left border is obscured.
