The patient is rotated to the right. There is continued evidence for pulmonary vascular congestion and a left pleural effusion. Left pleural fluid has redistributed. Underlying parenchymal consolidation would be difficult to exclude. A pigtail catheter has been withdrawn on the right. Allowing for differences in patient positioning, mediastinal structures are probably stable. A PICC remains in place.
