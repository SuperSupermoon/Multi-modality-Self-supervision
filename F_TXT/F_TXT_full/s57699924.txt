The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There is an asymmetry in the right upper lung that is difficult to characterize without lateral view. There is no evidence of pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. Again seen is a PICC line that now terminates in the cavoatrial junction. The hila and pleura are unremarkable.
