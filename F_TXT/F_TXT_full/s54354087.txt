Right IJ central line tip overlies proximal SVC. Mediastinal drain and left chest tube noted. No obvious pneumothorax. Possibility of a tiny left apical pneumothorax is difficult to X completely exclude. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, with sternotomy wires noted. There is upper zone redistribution, without overt CHF. Patchy retrocardiac opacity is similar to prior. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is again noted. Subsegmental atelectasis the right cardiophrenic region is improved. A cerclage wire overlies the overlap point of the left clavicle and left scapular spine. At the edge of these films, there is increased density in the left proximal humerus likely representing chondroid calcification.
