Since the previous film, there has been an increase in the size of both the right and the left effusion. There is volume loss in the left lower lobe and this is probably due to atelectasis, but a pneumonia in this region would give a similar appearance. Some opacification in the right upper lobe adjacent to the mediastinum is present. This did not appear to be present on the prior chest x-ray and may represent an aspiration pneumonia, though the position is unusual.
