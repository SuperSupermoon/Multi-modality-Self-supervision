The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable, with moderate cardiomegaly. Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema have slightly improved since the prior study. A tracheostomy tube terminating 5 cm above the carina, left upper extremity PICC terminating in the mid SVC and a left central venous catheter in the right atrium are all unchanged in position since the prior study. Mild hazy bibasilar opacities, most likely atelectasis. No consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.
