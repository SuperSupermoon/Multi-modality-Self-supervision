As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 1.7 cm above the carina. The tube should be pulled back by approximately 1 cm. The left internal jugular vein catheter is in unchanged position. Lung volumes remain low. The size of the cardiac silhouette is slightly increased. There is no evidence of pleural effusions, pneumonia, or pulmonary edema.
