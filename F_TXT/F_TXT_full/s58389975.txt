Compared with the prior study, there is new subsegmental atelectasis at the right lung base, with possible small bilateral effusions. Minimal linear atelectasis left base is also new. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF, similar to the prior film. No frank consolidation is identified. No free air seen beneath the diaphragms. Old healed left clavicular fracture again noted.
