As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Relatively large lung volumes with blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, likely caused by pleural scar. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and signs of minimal fluid overload. No pneumonia. No pneumothorax. A calcified thyroid nodule is present.
