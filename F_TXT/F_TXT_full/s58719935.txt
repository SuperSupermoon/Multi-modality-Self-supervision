AP chest compared to ___: Mild pulmonary edema, mediastinal vascular congestion and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette have all improved since ___, but there is appreciable worsening of right lower lobe consolidation. In the absence of rightward mediastinal shift, it would be more sensible to ascribe the change to new pneumonia. Right PIC line ends in the mid SVC, upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
