AP chest compared to ___: There has been a generalized worsening of heterogeneous pulmonary opacification in both lungs. Since accompanying it is greater dilatation of mediastinal veins, I suspect this is asymmetrically distributed edema though followup will be needed to exclude pneumonia. ET tube is in standard placement. A right subclavian central venous line ends close to or just beyond the superior cavoatrial junction. An upper enteric tube passes into the stomach. No pneumothorax.
