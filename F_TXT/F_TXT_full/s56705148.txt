Overall, aeration of the lungs appears similar compared to recent prior examination with ongoing basilar opacities and right mid lung opacity, findings consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Endotracheal tube, right approach central line and pacemaker leads are in unchanged expected position. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
