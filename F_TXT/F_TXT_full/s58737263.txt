The lungs are n hyperinflated, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is increased opacity at the right lung base, which could be due to underlying infection or aspiration. There appears to be perihilar peribronchial thickening. No large pleural effusion is seen although a trace right pleural effusion be difficult to exclude. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
