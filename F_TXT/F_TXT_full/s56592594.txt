Persistent patchy opacity at the left base most likely reflects slightly worsening left lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia or aspiration cannot be excluded. Possible layering left effusion. Calcified nodule in the left upper lobe consistent with prior granulomatous infection. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall stable cardiac and mediastinal contours given patient rotation on the current study. No pneumothorax.
