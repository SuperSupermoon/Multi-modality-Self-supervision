Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. Right internal jugular central venous catheter has been repositioned and now terminates in the expected location of the distal SVC. There are low lung volumes. The mediastinum appears widened as compared to the prior study performed earlier today at 13:03 which could relate to lower lung volumes and supine AP technique, although correlate clinically for acute mediastinal process and consider CT if of concern. Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema has increased. No pneumothorax.
