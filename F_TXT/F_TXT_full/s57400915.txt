Endotracheal tube terminates above the level of clavicles approximately 8.6 cm from carina. Consider advancing ET tube by 3-4 cm for a more secured seating. Single right chest drain at right lung base terminates near the cardiophrenic angle. Epidural catheter terminates at the mid thoracic level. Right internal jugular catheter sheath ends at upper SVC. Engorgement of pulmonary vasculature reflecting pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral lower lung atelectasis is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable. There is no pneumothorax. Mildly enlarged heart, mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.
