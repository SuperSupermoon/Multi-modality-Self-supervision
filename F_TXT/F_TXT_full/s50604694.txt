In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes. The pulmonary vessels appear somewhat more engorged than on the previous study, raising the possibility of worsening vascular congestion. Opacification at the bases is consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, more prominent on the right. Again there is a background of chronic interstitial lung disease.
