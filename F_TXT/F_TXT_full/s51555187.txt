Following tracheal extubation and removal of the nasogastric tube there has been marked progression of pulmonary consolidation previously predominating in the right upper lung at 07:22, now symmetrically involving both lungs more superiorly than inferiorly. The rapid progression in the setting of new mediastinal venous engorgement is most consistent with pulmonary edema, perhaps with a preceding pneumonia. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion is new or newly apparent. Heart is normal size but increased in the antrum. There is no pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends in the neck.
