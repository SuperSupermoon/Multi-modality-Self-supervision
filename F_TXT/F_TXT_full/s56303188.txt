Comparison is made to previous study from ___. Tip of the PICC line has been pulled back, now at the cavoatrial junction, appropriately sited. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position and stable. There are again seen diffuse airspace opacities bilaterally likely due to combination of pulmonary edema and potentially pneumonia. There are developing air bronchograms in the right perihilar region, slightly new since the prior study. There are no pleural effusions.
