1. Right basilar chest tube remains in place. There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle as well as thickening of the right lateral pleura, which may be related to the patient's known pleurodesis and/or residual effusion. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Streaky linear opacities at the left base may represent subsegmental atelectasis or scarring. Opacity at the right base may reflect atelectasis, although superimposed infection cannot be excluded. The upper right lung and the remainder of the left lung are clear. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
