The study is somewhat limited as the patient's chin projects over and obscures the lung apices. Lung volumes are slightly reduced. The heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is unfolded. The mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise unchanged. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Minimal patchy opacity in the left lung base likely reflects atelectasis. No pleural effusion, focal consolidation or large pneumothorax is identified. Clips from prior thyroidectomy are noted within the neck.
