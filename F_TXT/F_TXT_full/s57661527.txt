Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of left-sided chest tube. There has been resolution of the previously seen small left-sided pneumothorax. There is mild widening of the superior mediastinum, which is unchanged from the prior exam. A linear lucency projecting over the cardiomediastinal silhouette raises concern for pneumomediastinum. There is no substantial pleural effusion or focal lung consolidation. Heart size is normal. There has been interval increase in the degree of massive subcutaneous emphysema extending into the supraclavicular soft tissues and into the neck.
