The examination was centered in the upper abdomen rather than in the chest for assessment of a nasogastric tube, which terminates in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, probably in the proximal duodenum. However, this technique limits comprehensive assessment of the thoracic structures in this recently postoperative patient. Median sternotomy wires are present as well as midline drains and left-sided chest tubes. No definite pneumothorax is evident. Note is also made of a right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating in the right atrium, and there is likely an endotracheal tube present, with tip 5.2 cm above the carina, but this is not confidently assessed due to the limitations mentioned above. Marked cardiomediastinal widening is beyond that expected for recent surgery and raises the concern for the possibility of a mediastinal hematoma in the appropriate clinical setting. Partially loculated left pleural effusion is present as well as bilateral retrocardiac atelectasis. ___ was successfully paged to discuss these findings at 11:55 a.m. on ___ at the time of discovery.
