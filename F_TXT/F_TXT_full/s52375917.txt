In comparison with study of ___, there is now a nasogastric tube in place with its tip in the fundus and the side hole at about the level of the esophagogastric junction. The tube should be pushed forward if possible. There is some ill-defined increased opacification at the right base. This could merely reflect atelectasis, though in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered. There is subcutaneous gas in the right supraclavicular level extending to the medial aspect of the lower neck.
