1. Right pleural basilar catheter remains in place with a small pocket of air contiguous to it and there is improving aeration in the right hemithorax suggestive of decreasing pleural effusion. Right subclavian PICC line is in place and unchanged in position. There has been interval appearance of a patchy opacity in the left upper lobe with some increased prominence of the interstitium. Although these findings may reflect aspiration or pneumonia, an atypical appearance of pulmonary edema should also be considered. Clinical correlation is advised. Prominent interstitium in the recently aerated right upper and mid lung likely reflects re-expansion pulmonary edema. There is also airspace consolidation in the retrocardiac region which may reflect aspiration, pneumonia or possibly atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given obscuration of the right borders but overall the left borders are stable. Results were communicated to Dr. ___ by phone on ___ at 10am at the time of discovery.
