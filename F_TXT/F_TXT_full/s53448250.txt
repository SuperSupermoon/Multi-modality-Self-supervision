A single AP view of the chest shows a left Port-A-Cath in proper position with the tip at, or just above, the atriocaval junction. It is unchanged in position since the prior radiograph. The lungs are clear without consolidation or pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
