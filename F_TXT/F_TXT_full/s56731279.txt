In comparison with the study of ___, there is increasing opacification at both bases with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms. This suggests increasing layering pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis. Subcutaneous emphysema is essentially unchanged. Mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure is probably present. Monitoring and support devices remain in.
