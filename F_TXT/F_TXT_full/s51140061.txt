Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained. There is slight blunting of the costophrenic angles, which may be due to small pleural effusions. Patchy right lower lobe opacity is seen, worrisome for pneumonia with some possible underlying atelectasis. Patchy left basilar opacity most likely represents atelectasis, although consolidation from infection or aspiration is not excluded. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in technique and inspiration. No pneumothorax is seen.
