In comparison with the chest radiograph obtained 4 days prior, there is new, mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema and increased retrocardiac opacity, most likely atelectasis. Lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation. Heart size is normal. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal. No pleural effusions. An enteric tube passes through the stomach, into the proximal small bowel, and outside the field of view.
