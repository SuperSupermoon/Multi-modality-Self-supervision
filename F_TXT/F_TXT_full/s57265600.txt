Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding. Asymmetric opacification in the right mid lung may represent pulmonary edema, however aspiration could also be considered. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged. There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which ends approximately 3.3 cm from the carina. Additionally, a right internal jugular central venous line has been placed over the interval, with the tip ending in the right atrium. Retraction of this line by 2-3 cm low will results in positioning in the low SVC. The nasogastric tube ends in the esophagus, and should be advanced prior to use. Review of the chest radiograph performed after this study reveals improved positioning of the right internal jugular central line and persistent positioning of the nasogastric tube in the esophagus.
