There is a Port-A-Cath in place terminating at the lower superior vena cava and stable volume loss of the left lung with a leftward mediastinal shift. There is recurrent opacification of the left lung similar to what was seen on ___ although not present on the more recent CT. This appearance is nonspecific but could be seen with a widespread pneumonia or obstruction. Given the short timeframe of onset, it is unlikely that the opacification primarily reflects any potential recurrent malignancy, although increasing obstruction due to a hilar malignancy is not excluded. There is also probably a new pleural effusion on the left. The right lung remains clear without pleural effusion.
