AP chest compared to ___: Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper stomach but would need to be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction. Patient has baseline hyperinflation, but today lung volumes are lower. This may account in part for changes in the lungs, but dense consolidation in the right lower lobe is strongly suggestive of new pneumonia. Interstitial edema elsewhere is mild. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions unchanged. Endotracheal tube is in standard position, but the cuff is mildly overinflated. Upper esophageal distention is new, but could be transient. Right internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC. Extensive lymph node calcifications in the mediastinum and hila is a chronic finding. There is scarring in the right upper lobe.
