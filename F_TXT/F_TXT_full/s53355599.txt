Portable semi supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates hyperexpanded lungs. Persistent opacification of the right lower lung and retrocardiac space likely represents pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. There is a probable small right-sided pleural effusion. The endotracheal tube ends 4.4 cm from the carina. The nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view.
