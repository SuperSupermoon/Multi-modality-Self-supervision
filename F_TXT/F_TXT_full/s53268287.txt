Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding. Bilateral heterogeneous pulmonary opacities, predominately in the lower lobes, are slightly more prominent over the interval. New left-sided pleural effusion is small. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Endotracheal tube minutes 3.4 cm from the carina. Right-sided Port-A-Cath ends at the cavoatrial junction. Nasogastric tube ends in the neo-esophagus. There is no pneumothorax.
