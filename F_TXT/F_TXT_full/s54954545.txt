The lung volumes are low. There is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion. A pleural effusion is also suspected on the left. A mild interstitial abnormality is predominantly perihilar and suggests pulmonary vascular congestion. Prominence of each hilum also probably reflects mediastinal adenopathy as does widening of the right paratracheal stripe. Pulmonary nodules are not well assessed. Suture material projects over the left lower chest as before.
