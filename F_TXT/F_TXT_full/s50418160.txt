AP chest compared to ___: Relatively continuous improvement in opacification of the right lower lobe over two days suggests it was due to atelectasis, not pneumonia. Left lower lobe was clearly collapsed on ___ and is also better aerated, another site for atelectasis. Upper lungs are clear. Heart size normal. Some pleural effusion is presumed, but difficult to assess because the diaphragm contours are so high. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in a non-distended stomach. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
