Right-sided central venous catheter tip is seen in the lower SVC. Sternotomy wires and prosthetic valves are unchanged. Bilateral chest tubes are unchanged. Small bi-apical pneumothoraces persist, although there is no diaphragmatic flattening or mediastinal shift to suggest tension. There persists bibasilar opacity, more prominent on the right than the left, and in the appropriate clinical setting may represent pneumonia. There is no large pleural effusion.
