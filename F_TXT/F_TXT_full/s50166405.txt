The patient is rotated. There is significant soft tissue attenuation. Right lung volume is slightly less than the left lung with similar mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. No definite focal consolidation. Increased streaky opacity of the lung bases is probably atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Linear platelike atelectasis in the left mid lung. Cardiomegaly is overall unchanged. The thoracic aorta it is tortuous, unchanged. Pulmonary vascular congestion but no frank pulmonary edema, similar to the prior exam. The left proximal humeral hardware device, incompletely visualized, appears intact and overall similar to the prior exams.
