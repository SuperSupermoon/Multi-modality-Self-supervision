A Pleur-x catheter is seen terminating in the upper portion of the right lung. Compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there is a persistent moderate right-sided pleural effusion, slightly improved in the interval, with a new small air-fluid level in the right lung base suggesting a small hydropneumothorax component. Increased right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis, although infection is not excluded. Patchy left basilar opacity is also slightly worse in the interval. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. Deformity of the left humeral head is chronic.
