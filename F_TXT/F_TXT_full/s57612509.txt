1. Interval reduction in lung volumes with appearance of patchy opacities at both bases, which likely reflect atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia should also be considered. There is crowding of the pulmonary vasculature, most likely related to the low lung volumes with no evidence of overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusions. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given portable technique and differences in patient positioning.
