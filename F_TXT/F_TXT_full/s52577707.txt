Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in standard position. Widespread heterogeneous opacities persist throughout the right lung and within the left lower lobe. Although potentially due to contusion in the setting multiple known acute bilateral rib fractures, a multifocal aspiration event should be considered given the absence of the majority of these opacities at the time of the patient's initial trauma CT scan as well as the lack of substantial improvement over time. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are unchanged.
