The patient is status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-up. The inspiratory lung volumes are decreased. Increased opacification at the bilateral lung bases on the left greater than the right may represent atelectasis in this setting. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests trace left pleural fluid. Left apical opacification is stable in comparison to the prior study. There is no definitive evidence of pneumothorax. The thoracic aorta is tortuous with calcification of the aortic knob. The cardiac silhouette is incompletely evaluated in the setting of left basilar opacification that is likely stable. Surgical clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen are compatible with prior cholecystectomy. Surgical clips at the left hemidiaphragm and left upper quadrant may represent prior splenic surgery.
