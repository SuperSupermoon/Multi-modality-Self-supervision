Lordotic positioning. Again seen are low inspiratory volumes. As before, the carina is not well defined, but the tip of the ET tube appears to lie approximately 3.1 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, with tip over the upper stomach. If a sideport is present, it lies in the region of the GE junction. As noted, there are low inspiratory volumes, with elevated right hemidiaphragm and bibasilar atelectasis. There are some more patchy opacities throughout the left lung compared with the prior film. While this could represent more extensive atelectasis, it raises the question of an early infiltrate or area of aspiration. Attention to this area on followup films is requested. Doubt CHF. No effusion.
