There has been interval placement of a right-sided pigtail catheter with terminates over the right hemi thorax/ right upper abdomen. A chest tube is again seen in unchanged position. The size of a a large multiloculated right pleural effusion is stable compared to the prior examination done earlier this morning. No pneumothorax is identified. Opacity at the right base is consistent with atelectasis and effusion, also similar in extent. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. The left lung appears clear.
