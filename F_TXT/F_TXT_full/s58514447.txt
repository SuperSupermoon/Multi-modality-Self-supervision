AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Image field is directed to lower chest and upper abdomen identifies the newly inserted Dobbhoff line. The line reaches well below the diaphragm and is slightly curled up within the area of the fundus of the stomach. On the next preceding similar chest examination obtained 12 hours earlier during the same day, a conventional NG tube was present pointing towards the pylorus of the stomach. Apparently, these lines have been exchanged. Previously described extensive bilateral pulmonary parenchymal densities persist.
