Worsening dense left retrocardiac opacity with paucity of air bronchograms likely reflects complete left lower lobe collapse, and is accompanied by a small left pleural effusion. Apparent slight improvement in right pleural effusion and adjacent right basilar atelectasis. Previously present pneumoperitoneum is less well demonstrated on today's exam.
