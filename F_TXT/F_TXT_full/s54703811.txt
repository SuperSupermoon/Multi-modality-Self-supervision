The moderate left effusion appears unchanged. There is likely a new small right pleural effusion. The endotracheal tube ends 7.7 cm the carina. The enteric tube passes below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view within a decompressed stomach. The left-sided PICC line ends in the high SVC. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without frank pulmonary edema. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
