In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. Other monitoring and support devices remain in place, with the nasogastric tube now coiled in the stomach with the tip just beneath the left hemidiaphragm. Bilateral basilar opacification is consistent with layering effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases. Mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure is seen.
