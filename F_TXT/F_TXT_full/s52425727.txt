The patient is status post median sternotomy and valve replacement. Mild cardiomegaly is present. Right-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the region of the right atrium and right ventricle. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour is noted, which could be due to low lung volumes and the presence of mediastinal fat. There is crowding of bronchovascular structures with mild pulmonary vascular congestion noted. Patchy retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There are no displaced fractures identified.
