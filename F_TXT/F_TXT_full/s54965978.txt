As compared to ___ chest radiograph, a new focus of consolidation has developed in the right infrahilar region, as well as a poorly defined opacity in the left retrocardiac region. These findings may reflect aspiration or evolving aspiration pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Cardiomediastinal contours are similar to the recent radiograph, and linear scar atelectasis in left mid lung is unchanged.
