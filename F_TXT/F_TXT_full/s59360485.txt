Compared to chest radiographs ___. Lung volumes are lower but there is clearly progression of consolidation in the axillary and basal regions of the right chest, probably due to developing pneumonia. Left lung is essentially clear. The heart is normal size and there is no appreciable vascular engorgement in either the lungs or mediastinum. ET tube is in standard placement, at new esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view, and the apparent advance of the right PIC line from the superior cavoatrial junction into the upper right atrium is probably a function of lower lung volumes.
