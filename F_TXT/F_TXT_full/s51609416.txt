In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has been placement of a right chest tube at the base laterally. However, since there has been no change in the large pleural effusion, the tube may be malpositioned. A lateral view could prove helpful if the condition of the patient would permit. No evidence of pneumothorax.
