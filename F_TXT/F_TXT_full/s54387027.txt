Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiomediastinal contours and bronchovascular structures. Apparent increased patchy opacity in left retrocardiac region could potentially be due to atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes, but aspiration and early focus of pneumonia could produce a similar appearance. With this in mind, short-term followup radiograph may be helpful with improved inspiratory level. Exam is otherwise remarkable for right PICC terminating in the body of the right atrium.
