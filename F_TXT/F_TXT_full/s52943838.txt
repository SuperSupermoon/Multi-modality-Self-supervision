Previous pulmonary vascular congestion in asymmetric edema have largely cleared mild cardiomegaly is stable. There is new relatively uniform opacification in the right mid and lower lung zones. A lateral view would be helpful in order to determine how much if any of this is due to posteriorly layering pleural effusion and how much is due to focal pulmonary consolidation or residual asymmetric edema. There is as well consolidation of both lung bases, usually atelectasis but conceivably infection. Left trans subclavian right atrium right ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses from the left pectoral generator. Previous temporary right internal jugular pacer has been removed. There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. ET tube is in standard placement and an upper enteric drainage tube passes through nondistended stomach to or just beyond the pylorus.
