CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. A pigtail catheter is present at the left lung base. It is positioned higher than on the most recent study from ___ at 18:10 p.m. Again seen is the hydropneumothorax at the left base. The degree of air in this hydropneumothorax is greater than on the prior film and the lobulated opacity seen medial to it suggests a portion of collapsed lung. Mediastinum remains grossly midline. Increased interstitial left perihilar markings and bullous change in the upper left lung are again noted. The right lung is grossly unchanged.
