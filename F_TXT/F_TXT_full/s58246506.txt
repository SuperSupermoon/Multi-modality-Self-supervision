Suboptimal penetration limits evaluation. Lung volumes are low. The heart is moderately enlarged. There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions. Increased interstitial markings suggest mild pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities could reflect dependent edema, atelectasis or infection. There is no pneumothorax. The aortic arch is calcified.
