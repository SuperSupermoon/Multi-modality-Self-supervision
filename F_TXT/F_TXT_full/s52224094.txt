As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Minimal atelectasis at the right lung bases, small to moderate left pleural effusion with subsequent areas of atelectasis. The lung volumes remain very low. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3.3 cm above the carina, the endotracheal tube is new. The patient has also received a nasogastric tube. The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube is difficult to visualize but appears to project over the middle parts of the stomach. There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. No new parenchymal opacity.
