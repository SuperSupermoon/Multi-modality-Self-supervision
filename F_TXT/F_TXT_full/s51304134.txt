Endotracheal tube tip is 3 cm above the carina, right subclavian line ends in low SVC/cavoatrial junction, the tip of the feeding tube is in the proximal duodenum, single lead from the left pectoral ICD device is positioned in right atrium and right internal jugular catheter sheath tip is in mid SVC. Another linear radiopaque structure with its tip ending in the lower esophagus, is probably a core temperature monitoring device. Mild pulmonary edema is new since ___. However, given the low lung volumes, the severity of this could be exaggerated. Mediastinum is little wider than it was yesterday and bilateral pulmonary hila are prominent due to engorged pulmonary vasculature. Top normal heart size is unchanged. Minimal right lung base opacity is either atelectasis or a combination of atelectasis and pulmonary edema.
