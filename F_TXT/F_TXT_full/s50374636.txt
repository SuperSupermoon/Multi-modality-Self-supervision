Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinum is grossly unremarkable. Lungs are essentially clear except for right basal opacity which unclear if represents a true lesion or summation of shadows. Repeated radiograph preferably with full inspiration is required. If finding is persistent, assessment with chest CT would be necessary.
