Lung volumes are low. Heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous, and the mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present as a result of low lung volumes. A small to moderate size right pleural effusion is demonstrated with associated right basilar opacity, likely compressive atelectasis. Patchy left basilar opacity also may be reflective of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. No displaced fractures are seen.
