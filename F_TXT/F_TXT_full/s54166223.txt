The distal end of the NG tube is not included in this study. It goes probably in abdominal left inferior quadrant. Please refer to the concurrent abdominal x-ray. The lungs are otherwise clear. Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A surgical drain projects in the abdominal midline.
