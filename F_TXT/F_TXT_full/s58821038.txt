There has been interval development of a large left-sided pneumothorax, with displacement of the mediastinum to the right. The right lung base also shows more conspicuous opacities secondary to new atelectasis in the setting of previously existent right basal opacities. There is no right sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A new left-sided IJ line is seen crossing the midline and ending at the confluence of both innominate veins. An esophageal tube ends below the gastroesophageal junction and the endotracheal tube is unchanged in position compared with prior exam, ending 3 cm above the carina.
