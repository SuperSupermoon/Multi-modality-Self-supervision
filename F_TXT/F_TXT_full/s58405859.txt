Interval placement of basilar chest tube with decrease in right pleural effusion. A right subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip in the distal SVC. Right perihilar vasculature remains prominent, although the interstitial pattern has improved suggesting resolving edema. There is persistent patchy opacity at the left base likely reflecting atelectasis. There is also lucency overlying the heart centrally which may represent a hiatal hernia. Minimal blunting in the left costophrenic angle likely reflects a small effusion. No evidence of pneumothorax. The heart remains enlarged. Calcification in the aorta is consistent with atherosclerosis.
