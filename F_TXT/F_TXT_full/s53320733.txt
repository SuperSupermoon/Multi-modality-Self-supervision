As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. As a consequence, the width of the cardiac silhouette has increased and the extent of the bilateral predominantly perihilar and basal parenchymal opacities has also increased. There are, however, no new focal parenchymal opacities in the lung parenchyma. No pneumothorax. No larger pleural effusions. The monitoring and support devices are constant an in normal position.
