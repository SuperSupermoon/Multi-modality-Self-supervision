In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier,patient rotation limits precise comparison. With this limitation in mind, a moderate partially layering left pleural effusion appears slightly larger, and a small right pleural effusion has apparently decreased in size with associated improved aeration at the right lung base. No other relevant changes.
