As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Appearance of the pleural space on the right as well as of the partly atelectatic lung parenchyma on the right is constant. Constant increase in lung parenchymal density on the left, likely reflecting mild fluid overload, but improved as compared to the previous examination.
