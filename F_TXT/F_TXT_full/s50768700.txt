Lung volumes are low. This factor accentuates the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. Note is made of distention of the azygos vein contour as well as pulmonary vascular engorgement accompanied by mild-to-moderate perihilar edema and bilateral layering pleural effusions, large on the right and moderate on the left. No visible pneumothorax.
