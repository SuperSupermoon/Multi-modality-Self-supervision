As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices, including the endotracheal tube, are unchanged. The tip of the tube projects 7 cm above the carina and should be advanced by approximately 2-3 cm. The lung volumes have increased, potentially reflecting increased ventilatory pressure. As a consequence, the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities appear slightly less widespread than before. No new opacities. Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural effusions.
