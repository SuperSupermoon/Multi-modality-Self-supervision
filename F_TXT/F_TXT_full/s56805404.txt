Rightward mediastinal and cardiac shift reflect a small decrease in volume of the right hemithorax, but right lung volume is approximately unchanged secondary due to decrease in small right pneumothorax and concomitant increase in small right pleural effusion. The left lung is unremarkable. Heart size is normal, but larger today. There is no pulmonary edema or vascular congestion. Subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged in quantity, but different in distribution. A linear right lower lung opacity is probably atelectasis. Two right chest tubes are unchaned, one in the apex, the other in the base.
