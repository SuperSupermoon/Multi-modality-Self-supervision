As compared to the previous image, the lung volumes have slightly increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation. As a consequence, the radio density of the left lung base has also decreased. A mild to moderate left pleural effusion, combined to mild cardiomegaly and retrocardiac atelectasis, however, persist. No pneumothorax. Unchanged course of the right central venous access line, with the tip projecting over the right atrium.
