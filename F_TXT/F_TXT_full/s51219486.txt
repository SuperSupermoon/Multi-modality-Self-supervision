Comparison is made to previous study from ___. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 6.4 cm above the carina. There is a left-sided central catheter with distal tip in the proximal right atrium, stable. There is a left retrocardiac opacity and bilateral pleural effusions, left side worse than right. A small focal area of consolidation within the right mid lung zone. Continued attention to this area is recommended on subsequent exams. This may be related to the chest tube placement. The right-sided chest tube tip is again seen in the apex of the lung. There are no pneumothoraces identified.
