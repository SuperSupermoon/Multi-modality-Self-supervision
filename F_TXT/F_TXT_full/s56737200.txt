Compared to the prior exam approximately 1.5 hours previously, there is increased bilateral perihilar opacification, vascular markings, and peribronchial cuffing, consistent with pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, appear new or increased. No pneumothorax is detected. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
