A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained. The lungs are well expanded. There is minimal atelectasis at the left base. Cardiomegaly is mild. There is no effusion, pneumothorax, or consolidation. Heterotopic calcification and surgical clips in the right axilla are sequelae from prior axillary-bi-femoral bypass. The left subclavian central catheter terminates in the proximal left basilic vein.
