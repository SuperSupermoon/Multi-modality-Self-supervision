A right IJ sheath is present. The tip lies near the point of confluence with the subclavian vessel. Tubing overlies the upper mediastinum in the midline. If this is an ET tube, it lies relatively low, only 1 cm above the carina. If it is an NG tube, then it has not passed beyond the mid esophagus. There are low inspiratory volumes. There is probable mild vascular plethora, though this is likely accentuated by low inspiratory volumes. Minimal subsegmental atelectasis at the bases. No focal infiltrate, frank consolidation or gross effusion. No free air seen beneath the diaphragm. R Rounded densities overlying the cardiac silhouette adjacent to the descending aorta may represent vessels seen on-end.
