Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position. There is improving aeration in the left hemithorax but persistent consolidation in the left upper and lower lobes consistent with lobar atelectasis, infection, or pulmonary hemorrhage. Clinical correlation is advised. There is likely a layering effusion. The right lung also has improved aeration suggesting that there likely was a component of superimposed edema. No obvious pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to the left hemithorax airspace process.
