In comparison with the study of 5 or in IN, there is little interval change. Again there are multiple, widely displaced rib fractures in the upper left, better seen on CT. Clavicular fracture is difficult to assess radiographically. Hyperexpansion of the lungs is again seen consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. No definite pleural effusions on this apparently more erect view. No vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.
