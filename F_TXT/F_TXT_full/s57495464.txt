AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR RADIOGRAPH OF 1 DAY EARLIER, THE PATIENT HAS BEEN EXTUBATED AND A SWAN-GANZ CATHETER HAS BEEN ADVANCED FARTHER INTO THE DESCENDING LEFT PULMONARY ARTERY. THIS COULD BE WITHDRAWN A FEW CM FOR STANDARD POSITIONING. LEFT LUNG APPEARS BETTER AERATED WITH RESIDUAL LEFT LOWER LOBE COLLAPSE AND A MODERATE LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION AND POSSIBLE TINY APICAL PNEUMOTHORAX, WITH CHEST TUBE REMAINING IN PLACE. EXAM IS OTHERWISE REMARKABLE FOR RESOLVING RIGHT BASILAR ATELECTASIS.
