Lung volumes remain extremely low. Left lower lobe opacity has increased, likely due to increasing pleural fluid; though the overall opacity likely reflects a combination of atelectasis, known pleural mass and pleural fluid. A tiny left apical pneumothorax is stable. A left pleurX catheter terminates near the left hilum. Subcutaneous emphysema along the left chest wall is decreased.
