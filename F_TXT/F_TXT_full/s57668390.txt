Endotracheal tube appears in place in midtrachea. Right internal jugular central venous catheter appears in place with the tip at the lower SVC. Enteric tube traverses to the stomach. There has been continued improvement in biapical mild pulmonary edema. Again noted is persistent left lower lobe collapse and adjacent small to moderate pleural effusion. Right basilar opacities likely representing a combination of small pleural effusion and atelectasis and right middle lobe opacities likely representing atelectasis versus pneumonia appear stable.
