AP chest compared to 7:21 A.M., ___: Previously reported new left pleural effusion, hemothorax until proved otherwise, has increased substantially now displacing and nearly collapsing most of the left lung and shifting mediastinum appreciably to the right at the expense of right lung volume. Findings were discussed by radiology resident, Dr. ___ with Dr ___ at time study was performed, and Dr ___ ___ I spoke again at the time of dictation. Nasogastric tube passes to the distal stomach as before. New opacification at the base of the right lung could be atelectasis alone or new pneumonia. The heart border is obscured by the new left pleural effusion, but development of hemopericardium needs to be considered from a clinical standpoint, and subjected to appropriate imaging if that diagnosis is entertained.
