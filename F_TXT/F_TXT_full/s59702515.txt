Lung volumes are very low likely due to severe abdominal distention from dilated large bowel. There are bibasilar opacities, which likely represents atelectasis; however, pneumonia cannot be ruled out. The patient has tracheostomy in appropriate position. No evidence of pneumothorax. No large pleural effusion identified. Please see dedicated abdominal films for better characterization of the abdominal findings.
