A tracheostomy is in-situ. A right-sided PICC terminates in the right atrium, this could be withdrawn 3-4 cm for better positioning in the distal SVC. There are bilateral chest tubes in-situ. These are unchanged in position when compared to the prior study. There is persistent bibasal pleural effusions, similar in degree when compared to the prior study. There is associated bibasilar atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
