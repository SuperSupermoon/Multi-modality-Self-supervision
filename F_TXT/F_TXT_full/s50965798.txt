Interval placement of intra-aortic balloon pump, with the tip terminating approximately 5.2 cm below the superior aspect of the aortic knob. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Bilateral predominantly perihilar airspace disease has minimally improved, and may reflect pulmonary edema. Curvilinear interface in the right upper lobe favors a skinfold over a pneumothorax, but attention to this region on a short-term followup radiograph would be helpful to exclude atypical pneumothorax, particularly in the setting of a right pleural effusion. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
