Portable frontal radiograph of the chest is overall unchanged from the prior study. Again seen is increased density and irregular contour of the mediastinal and right suprahilar regions correlating with mediastinal mass seen on CT with distal right upper lobe opacification but to represent postobstructive pneumonia. Although, the stent is difficult to visualize radiographically, the overall configuration of the trachea is stable. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
