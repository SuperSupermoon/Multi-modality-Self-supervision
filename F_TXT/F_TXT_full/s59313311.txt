Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates low lying ET tube with tip 3.6 cm below the upper margin of the clavicle, extending to the region of the carina, likely accentuated by kyphotic position of the patient. This could be retracted by 1-1.5 cm cm to ensure safe positioning. An enteric tube traverses below the diaphragm out of view. The lung volumes are low, accentuating bronchovascular crowding. There is no pneumothorax.
