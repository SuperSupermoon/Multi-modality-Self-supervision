Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above level the carina. Enteric tube courses into the left hemi thorax, terminating in the midline below the diaphragm. Please note that on subsequent CT, the enteric tube is seen terminating in the proximal stomach. However, the side port may remain high in position. Low lung volumes persist in there increased bibasilar opacities since the prior study which may be due to atelectasis and/or aspiration. No large pleural effusion is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
