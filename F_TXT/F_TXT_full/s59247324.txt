Interval removal of nasogastric tube. Unchanged position of left PICC. Stable cardiomediastinal contours. Bilateral diffuse alveolar lung opacities with scattered areas of spared lung, predominantly in the left upper lobe and right juxtahilar region have slightly progressed in the interval and in conjunction with CT of ___, these findings likely represent a multifocal pneumonia, possibly secondary to aspiration. Coexisting pulmonary edema is likely. Persistent small pleural effusions, but no visible pneumothorax.
