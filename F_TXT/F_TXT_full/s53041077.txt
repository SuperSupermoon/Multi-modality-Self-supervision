Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval decrease in size of the right-sided pleural effusion, which is now moderate in size. Linear lucency along the right lateral lung had resolved on subsequent chest radiograph and likely represents a skin fold rather than a pneumothorax. Stable small left pleural effusion. Bibasilar compressive atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
