The lungs are poorly inflated. The left lower lung field is opacified as it was in the prior exam, with a distinct linear consolidation tracking across the left lower lobe, likely representing atelectasis with a concurrent small pleural effusion. Otherwise, the remaining lung fields are clear. Cardiac sillhouette appears slightly smaller suggesting improvement of the pericardial effusion. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
