As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with bilateral relatively extensive parenchymal opacities. The appearance of these opacities and their distribution suggests atelectasis rather than pneumonia. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
