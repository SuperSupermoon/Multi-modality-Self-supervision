In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal in size or slightly enlarged. Some indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. There again are a areas of increased opacification at both bases. On the right, obscuration of the hemidiaphragm is consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the lower lungs. Less prominent changes are seen at the left base. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
