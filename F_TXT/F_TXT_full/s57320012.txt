There is a right cardiophrenic opacity with associated right-sided volume loss and mild rightward mediastinal and trachial deviation, suspicious for right lower lobe collapse. There is no pneumothorax. A small right pleural effusion is present. The upper mediastinal contour is within normal limits. A right tunneled central venous line terminates at the caval atrial junction.
