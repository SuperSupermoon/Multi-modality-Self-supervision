Previous right pneumothorax has resolved and mediastinum has returned to the midline. Right apical pleural drainage tube in place. Some infrahilar consolidation persists in the left lower lobe and should be monitored for possible developing pneumonia. No appreciable left pleural abnormality. Heart size normal. Subcutaneous emphysema in the left neck is probably the result of the pneumothorax, since resolved dissecting out of the chest.
