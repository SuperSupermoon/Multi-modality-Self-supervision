Comparison is made with prior study performed eight hours earlier. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Lines and tubes are in unchanged position. Right lower lobe opacity has increased, likely due to recent BAL. Diffuse left perihilar and left lower lobe opacities are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
