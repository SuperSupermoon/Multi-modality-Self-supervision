1. Nasogastric tube remains unchanged in position. Right chest tube also remains in place, unchanged. A left subclavian central line has its tip in the distal SVC, unchanged.

Bibasilar opacity is also again seen likely representing a combination of postoperative changes and atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.
