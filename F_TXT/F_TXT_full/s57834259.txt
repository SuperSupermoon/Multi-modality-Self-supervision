AP chest compared to ___ through ___: Variations day-to-day in the intensity of diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality are more likely due to changes in ventilator settings and hemodynamics than real changes. For example, today, there has been mild clearing in the right upper lung, but both lower lungs are as densely consolidated as before. Overall, I doubt that there has been any change in pneumonia over the past several days. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also stable. Heart size is normal. ET tube, right internal jugular lines are in standard placements and an upper elementary tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
