Comparison is made to previous study from ___. The endotracheal tube and feeding tube are unchanged in position. The heart size is within normal limits. There is again seen low lung volumes. There is prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings with more focal confluent areas of opacities at the lung bases. These ground-glass reticular opacities are greater on the right side and remained stable. This may be due to pulmonary edema; however, underlying infection is not excluded.
