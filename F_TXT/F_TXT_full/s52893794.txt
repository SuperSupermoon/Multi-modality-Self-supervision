The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A right-sided pacemaker device has been placed, terminating in the right ventricle. There is a moderate pleural effusion on the left with associated opacity, probably due to atelectasis, including volume loss and mild leftward shift of mediastinal structures. Aside from streaky and band-like opacities in the right lower lung suggesting minor atelectasis, the right lung appears clear. There is no pleural effusion of the right or pneumothorax. There is no definite evidence for free air.
