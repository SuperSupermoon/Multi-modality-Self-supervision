Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm above the carina. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm. There are low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. Blunting of the costophrenic angles could relate to low lung volumes or small pleural effusions. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
