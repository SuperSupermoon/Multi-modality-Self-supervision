AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained the same day earlier. The right chest tube is in place. There is small apical pneumothorax, unchanged since the prior study. The post-surgical opacity in the right upper lung is redemonstrated. Left pleural effusion is most likely present, unchanged. Overall, the appearance of the chest including substantial dextroscoliosis is stable.
