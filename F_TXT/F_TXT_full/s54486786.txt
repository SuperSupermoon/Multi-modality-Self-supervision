Single AP semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained. Prominent costochondral calcifications are seen. There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may be due to overlying soft tissue, though a trace pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No definite focal consolidation is seen. There is likely left base atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. The aorta is calcified and tortuous. No displaced fracture is seen.
