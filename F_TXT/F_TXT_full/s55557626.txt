There has been interval removal of the right pigtail catheter with some sutural material at the right apex and a small pocket of loculated air in the right apex. A chest tube is now in place. The lungs are without evidence of focal airspace consolidation or pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
