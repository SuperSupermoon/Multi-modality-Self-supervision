Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Lungs are clear except for bibasilar opacities, including linear atelectasis at the left base, and a focus of patchy and linear opacification in the right infrahilar region. This may reflect atelectasis, aspiration or early pneumonia. Right internal jugular catheter terminates the proximal right atrium, with no pneumothorax. .
