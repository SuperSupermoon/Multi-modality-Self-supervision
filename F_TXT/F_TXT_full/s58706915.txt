Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Endotracheal tube terminates 2.0 cm above the carina. Left subclavian central catheter terminates in the right atrium. Heart size is top normal. Low lung volumes simulates vascular congestion, and severe left lower lobe atelectasis explains leftward mediastinal shift. Blunting of left costophrenic angle suggests a small left pleural effusion. Interstitial abnormality at the base of the right lung, including microcalcifications, is chronic. No pneumothorax. Stomach is severely distended with air and fluid; no NGT in place.
