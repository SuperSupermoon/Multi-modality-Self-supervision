The inspiratory lung volumes are slightly decreased. The lungs are symmetrically well aerated without focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia, significant pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged and there is no frank pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size allowing for low inspiratory lung volumes. Mild calcification at the aortic knob is noted and there is mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. The mediastinum is within normal limits otherwise. The visualized upper abdomen shows multiple surgical clips in the left upper abdomen, unchanged from the prior study. Degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral joint are again noted.
