There has been slight interval withdrawal and rotation of a left base pigtail pleural catheter with interval resolution of a small loculated air pocket surrounding the pig tail. There is no recurrent pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is moderately enlarged. There is redemonstration of scattered calcified plaques, likely from asbestosis. Subtle hazy alveolar opacities in the left lung are unchanged and difficult to discern from pleural plaques.
