A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right chest wall port with the catheter terminating in the upper right atrium. Lung volumes are low, with exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette. There is increasing patchy opacity in the bilateral lower lobes, some of which could be atelectasis, but are also concerning for multifocal pneumonia. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
