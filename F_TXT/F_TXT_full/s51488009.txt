In comparison with study of ___, the endotracheal tube has been pulled back so that the tip lies approximately 4 cm above the carina. The pulmonary edema has substantially cleared. Opacification in the retrocardiac region most likely reflects some volume loss in the lower lobe. Hazy opacification at the right base could reflect small effusion and atelectatic changes. The upper two-thirds of the lungs are clear. Nasogastric tube and right IJ catheter remain in unchanged position.
