Comparison is made with prior study performed six hours earlier. There is a questionable left apical pneumothorax; followup is recommended. There are low lung volumes. Cardiac size is normal. Left lower lobe opacities have minimally improved consistent with improving atelectasis, but aspiration could be also present. In the right upper lobe, the ill-defined opacities could be due to atelectasis and/or aspiration. The stomach is very distended.
