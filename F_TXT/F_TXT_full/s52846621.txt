In comparison with chest radiograph from ___, pulmonary edema has mildly improved, though multifocal consolidations in the right lung have probably worsened and may reflect aspiration. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Significant left deviation of the trachea is unchanged and likely suggests thyroid enlargement or mass, though a thoracic aortic aneurysm cannot be definitively excluded based on this study alone.
