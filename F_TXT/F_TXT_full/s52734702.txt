CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW The ET tube lies approximately 6.1 cm above the carina, with its tip still approximately 13 mm above the superior edge of the medial clavicular heads. There is probable slight volume loss on the left, with shift of the mediastinum, left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, and slight hazy opacity throughout the left lung, which probably reflects atelectasis in the left lung. The left subclavian PICC line remains relatively lateral in position.
