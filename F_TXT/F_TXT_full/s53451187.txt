1. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given patient rotation on the current examination. Lung volumes have diminished and there is patchy opacity noted at the right base which is more confluent as well as linear opacity at the left base. These findings may reflect bibasilar atelectasis and/or post-inflammatory scarring. However, given the focality of the finding on the right side, this would be concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. Pulmonary vasculature is somewhat prominent, but there is no overt pulmonary edema. There is a healing right posterolateral rib fracture with some callus formation which was not previously seen. No pneumothorax. No pleural effusions.
