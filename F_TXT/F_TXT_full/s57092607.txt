A right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the mid SVC. Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. Aorta remains tortuous. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion which appears relatively unchanged. No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is demonstrated, however the left costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view. There is no focal consolidation, with patchy atelectasis noted in the lung bases.
