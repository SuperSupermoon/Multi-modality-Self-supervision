The endotracheal tube tip terminates 5.5 cm above the level of the carina. Diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities are new from prior and likely reflect moderately severe pulmonary edema given the clinical history of heart failure. Additionally, baseline cardiomegaly has increased, findings consistent with decompensated heart failure. There are possible small layering bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified. A linear opacity in the medial right lung base is unchanged from multiple priors and may reflect a foreign body.
