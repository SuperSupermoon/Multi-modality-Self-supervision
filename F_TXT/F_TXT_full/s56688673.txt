Endotracheal tube and feeding tube have been removed. There is a tracheostomy tube whose distal tip is at the level the clavicular heads, 5 cm above the carina. There is again seen a right-sided PICC line with the distal tip at the cavoatrial junction. Heart size is within normal limits. There is improved aeration at the right infrahilar opacity. There are no pneumothoraces. ___, MD
