Persistent widening of mediastinum and hilar contours due to a combination of lymphadenopathy and mediastinal lipomatosis as shown on prior PET-CT. Heart size is normal. Lung volumes are slightly improved since the recent study with associated improved aeration of the lung bases. No evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
