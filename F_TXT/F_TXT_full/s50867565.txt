Lung volumes are low. Heart size is top-normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. Linear opacity in the left lung base likely reflects an area of subsegmental atelectasis. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or definite pneumothorax is detected, however the right apex is somewhat obscured by the patient's neck and chin projecting over this area. Left axillary clips are noted. There appear to be mildly displaced fractures of the right lateral fifth through seventh ribs.
