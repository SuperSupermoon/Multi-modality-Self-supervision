Markedly rotated positioning. Allowing for this, a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter has been placed. The tip overlies a right inferior pulmonary. No obvious pneumothorax is identified. Cardiac silhouette appears larger than on the prior study. In addition, there is new confluent increased retrocardiac opacity, with new obscuration of the left left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Obscured blunting of the right costophrenic angle is compatible with a left effusion. Hazy density at the left base laterally could reflect either a layering effusion or additional atelectasis. There is evidence of CHF, with vascular plethora and vascular blurring. There is focal patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region less well seen due to patient rotation. There is new hazy density in the right cardiophrenic angle suggesting a small right pleural effusion.
