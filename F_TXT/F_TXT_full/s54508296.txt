Compared with the prior film and allowing for differences in technique, there may be a new small left pleural effusion. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is background COPD, with cardiomegaly, CHF with interstitial and alveolar edema, an slight elevation left hemidiaphragm. Patchy opacity in the right infrahilar region is also again seen.
