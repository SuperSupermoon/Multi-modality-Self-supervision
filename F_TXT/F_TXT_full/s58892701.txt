Portable AP upright chest radiograph provided. When compared with a prior CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated ___, a curvilinear calcification projecting over the left lung base corresponds with a partially calcified left ventricular aneurysm. Overall appearance is unchanged from prior exam dating back to ___. There are low lung volumes which somewhat limit the evaluation, though allowing for this there is no focal consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is enlarged. The mediastinal contour is stable. The imaged osseous structures are intact. An AICD is again seen with leads extending to the region of the right atrium and right ventricle.
