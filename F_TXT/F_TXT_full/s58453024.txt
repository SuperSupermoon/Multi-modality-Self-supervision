In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged. There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure that may have improved since the prior study. The hemidiaphragm on the right is better seen, suggesting some improved pleural effusion, though this could merely be a reflection of a more upright position of the patient. Opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectatic changes and possible small effusion.
