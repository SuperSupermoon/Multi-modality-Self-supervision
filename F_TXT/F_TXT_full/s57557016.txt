AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is at the higher end, just above the clavicular heads, 8 cm above the carina. Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Perihilar opacities appear to be minimally progressed since the prior study and might potentially reflect vascular engorgement/interstitial minimal edema. The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm with its tip not included in the field of view. No central venous lines identified. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion seen.
