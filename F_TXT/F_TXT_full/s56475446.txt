As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a bigger inspiratory effort. Both the left and the right hila appear borderline in diameter, caused by borderline sized pulmonary arteries. A clinical correlate of pulmonary hypertension should be excluded. Since yesterday, no new changes have occurred. No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Normal mediastinal contours.
