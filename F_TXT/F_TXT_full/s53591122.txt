As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing opacity at the right lung base has completely resolved. On the left, the opacity, likely reflecting atelectasis, has mildly increased. The lung volumes are low. Severe scoliosis with subsequent asymmetry of the ribcage. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. The monitoring and support devices are in correct position. No pneumothorax.
