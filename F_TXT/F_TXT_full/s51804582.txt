There are diffuse widespread pulmonary airspace opacities more confluent in the right middle lobe and lingula compared to the CT from ___. A small to moderate left pneumothorax is similar to the outside hospital radiograph from earlier today. Mild septal thickening may be due to pulmonary edema. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal in size however largely obscured by airspace opacities. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
