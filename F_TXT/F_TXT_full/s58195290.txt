Since the prior radiograph on ___, bilateral pigtail catheters have been placed resulting in interval resolution of pleural effusions. There is no pneumonia, pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Of note, there are two vertical lines that mimic pneumothorax; however, the presence of lung markings lateral to these lines suggests that they are skin folds. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities.
