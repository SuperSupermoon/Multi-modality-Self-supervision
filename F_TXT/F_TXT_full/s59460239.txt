AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. The ET tube tip is 4.6 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged as well as bilateral pleural effusions and diffuse parenchymal opacities, highly concerning for pulmonary edema. Diffuse infection might be another possibility to consider although less likely based on the radiological findings.
