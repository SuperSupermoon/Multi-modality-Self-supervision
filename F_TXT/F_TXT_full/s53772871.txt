Left perihilar opacities again seen, which may relate to postoperative and post-radiation changes as seen on the prior CT. There is a left retrocardiac opacity as well as obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm which may relate to volume loss and postoperative changes; however, appears more dense than compared to the scout image from CT from ___.
