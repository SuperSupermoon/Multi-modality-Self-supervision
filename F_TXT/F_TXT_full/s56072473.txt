Single portable AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of a chest tube within the right hemithorax which medially projects over the midline. Previously seen right pneumothorax is no longer appreciated. Lungs are hyperinflated with flattening of the hemidiaphragms suggestive of emphysematous changes. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. No acute osseous abnormalities detected. There is no pleural effusion.
