AP chest at 5:21 compared to ___ for at 6:40: Masslike consolidation in the axillary region of the left lung is a little smaller. I am still concerned that it may mask a lung carcinoma. Pulmonary vasculature remains mildly engorged but there is no edema. Cardiomegaly is mild and unchanged. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard placement. Remnant catheter fragments end in the right atrium and left lower lobe, as before. Right supraclavicular dual channel hemodialysis set ends in the right atrium. An upper enteric drainage tube passes into the nondistended stomach and out of view.
