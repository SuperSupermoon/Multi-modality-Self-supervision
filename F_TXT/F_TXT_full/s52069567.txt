Opacification in the left base could represent merely atelectasis, though the extent suggests superimposed aspiration or infectious pneumonia. Continued blunting of the costophrenic angles is consistent with small pleural effusions. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in the left lobe .
