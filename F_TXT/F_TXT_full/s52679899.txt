In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with substantial pulmonary edema that is somewhat asymmetric toward the right. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could be consistent with pneumonia. The left hemidiaphragm again is poorly seen with retrocardiac opacification. This could represent volume loss in the left lower lobe and effusion, though again in the appropriate clinical setting this could be the focus of infection.
