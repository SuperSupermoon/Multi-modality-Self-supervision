In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. Bilateral pigtail catheters remain in place in this patient with layering pleural effusions and compressive basilar atelectasis. There may be a small apical pneumothorax on the right. Tracheostomy tube is in good position. The right subclavian catheter probably extends to the upper portion of the right atrium. In view of the extensive pulmonary changes, in the appropriate clinical setting it would be impossible to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
