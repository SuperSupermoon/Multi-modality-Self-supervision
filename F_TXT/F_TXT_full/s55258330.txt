A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained. There is a moderate-sized left pleural effusion and adjacent compressive atelectasis; however, pneumonia is not excluded. Rounded opacity along the right hilus may represent a mass. There is pulmonary vascular engorgement without pulmonary edema. Severe dextroconvex thoracic scoliosis is noted. There is no left effusion or pneumothorax. Deformity of the left humerus likely reflects sequelae of an old injury.
