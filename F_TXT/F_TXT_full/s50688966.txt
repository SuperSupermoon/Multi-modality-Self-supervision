There are small-to-moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions and associated basilar opacities, larger on the left than the right. These opacities may represent compressive atelectasis, though a component of infection is difficult to completely exclude. Additionally, there is mild vascular congestion. No pneumothorax is identified. The mediastinal contours are unchanged, and normal. Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted along the aortic arch. The heart is moderately enlarged. It appears slightly increased in size since the prior exam. Otherwise, there has been little change.
