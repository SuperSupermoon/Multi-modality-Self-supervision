AP chest compared to ___: Mild pulmonary edema was present on ___, and recurred on ___. Subsequently, it has improved. Previously, bilateral pleural effusion was moderate, it has decreased on the right, and remained stable on the left. Unusual linear contours parallel to the right lower chest could be bands of atelectasis, but if the patient has had an interval thoracentesis, I would strongly recommend carefully positioned upright chest radiographs to exclude pneumothorax. Severe cardiomegaly and generally widened thoracic aortic contour are stable. Mediastinal veins are still dilated. There is no pneumothorax. Right PIC line ends in the upper SVC. Dr. ___ was paged at 9:10 a.m. as soon as the findings were recognized.
