Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies available for comparison. Heart size is top normal. Mediastinum is grossly unremarkable with most likely present substantial mediastinal lipomatosis. Bilateral opacities are noted, predominantly in the lung bases with some associated pleural irregularity, most likely representing chronic process. They were demonstrated in part on the prior CT abdomen from ___, but appeared to be more progressed thus potentially may reflect superimposed infectious process. Assessment of the patient with chest CT should be considered.
