In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is more prominence of the cardiac silhouette, presumably related to the AP supine rather than the PA upright position. Mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels could reflect mild elevation in pulmonary venous pressure. Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen, as well as suggestion of more coalescent opacification in the right upper lung. In the appropriate clinical setting, this could be a manifestation of developing consolidation.
