AP chest compared to ___, 4:53 a.m.: Over the course of less than four hours, the pulmonary circulation has grown somewhat more engorged in the left lung, with the major changes in the right lung where there is new heterogeneous opacification in the mid and lower lung zones. Appearance is similar to ___ in the right lung, when the left lung showed mild edema. I suspect most of the abnormality in the right hemithorax is due to atelectasis and unilateral edema in a patient who probably lies in a right decubitus position. This would of course make her prone to aspirate to the right lung as well. Left internal jugular line ends in the mid SVC. Heart size is top normal. Pleural effusion if any is small on the right. No pneumothorax.
