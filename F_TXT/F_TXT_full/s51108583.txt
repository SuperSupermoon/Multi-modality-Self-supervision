The heart is normal in size. There is heterogeneous opacification in each mid to lower lung and each hilum is mildly enlarged. This is probably due to enlargement of pulmonary vessels in association with mild vascular congestion. Confluent opacification obscuring the left cardiac border suggests pneumonia in the lingula, although pneumonia might not be confined to this area.
