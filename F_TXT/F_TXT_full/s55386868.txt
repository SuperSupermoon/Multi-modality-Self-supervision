AP chest compared to 7:01 p.m.: Nasogastric tube has been withdrawn to the level of the aortic arch, terminating just below the thoracic inlet in the neoesophagus, now containing a little more air, but not severely distended. Right pleural and soft tissue drainage tubes still in place. No appreciable right pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Subcutaneous emphysema in the right chest wall, unchanged. Intestinal distention in the upper abdomen still quite severe, makes it difficult to exclude a small pneumoperitoneum, although that would not be clinically significant. Mild left and moderate right basal atelectasis minimally changed. Heart size normal. No pulmonary edema.
