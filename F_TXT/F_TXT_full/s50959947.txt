The right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter has been substantially pulled back and now has its tip in the pulmonary outflow tract. The left internal jugular central line is unchanged in position. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The intra-aortic balloon pump has its tip only 0.8 cm below the top of the aortic knob. Overall, the lungs appear clear with continued resolution of interstitial and pulmonary edema. There are likely very small bilateral pleural effusions. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
