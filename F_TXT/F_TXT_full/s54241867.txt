The heart is mildly enlarged with left ventricular configuration. The aortic arch is calcified. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests perhaps a very small pleural effusion or atelectasis. Chain suture material is new since the earlier examination along the right upper lung. Otherwise, the lungs appear clear.
