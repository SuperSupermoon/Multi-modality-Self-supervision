There has been interval placement of a right-sided chest tube with tip projecting over the mid right lung field, and side port appears to be at the level of the lateral thoracic ribcage with a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema. Previously noted right hydropneumothorx with large right pleural effusion component has slightly decreased in size compared to the prior study, with a small amount appearing to be loculated in the major fissure. The small right apical pneumothorax component appears unchanged. There is continued right basilar opacification compatible with compressive atelectasis. Previously noted leftward shift of mediastinal structures has resolved. Left lung remains hyperinflated with atelectasis in the left lung base. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Left-sided pacemaker device is seen with lead terminating in the right atrium. Mild right-sided pulmonary vascular congestion is present. Extensive degenerative changes of both glenohumeral joints are noted.
