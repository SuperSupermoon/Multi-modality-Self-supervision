Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates mild cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, and interstitial edema. However, the right upper lobe is disproportionately consolidated suggestive of pneumonia. There was a smaller consolidation in the same lobe in ___, so either the pneumonia is recurrent or the abnormality is the 'pneumonia' form of bronchioloalveolar cell lung cancer. Another alterhative is asymmetric edema if patient has marked mitral regurgitation. Probable small left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate hiatus hernia is chronic.
