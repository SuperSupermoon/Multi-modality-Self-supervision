Diffuse subcutaneous emphysema has slightly improved in the interval and pneumomediastinum has also slightly decreased in extent. Right-sided chest tube remains in place, with no visible pneumothorax, but extensive subcutaneous emphysema could potentially obscure a small pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and is accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Interval improved aeration at both lung bases with otherwise no additional relevant changes since the recent study.
