Comparison is made with prior study ___. Increased opacity in the left lateral hemithorax likely corresponds to increase in pleural effusion. If any, there is a small right pleural effusion. Bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis have increased on the left. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged, pneumomediastinum has almost resolved. There is a tiny left pneumothorax. Left chest wall subcutaneous gas has decreased. Left chest tube is in place, the tip projects at the level of the posterior sixth left rib.
