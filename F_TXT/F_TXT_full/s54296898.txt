Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent retrocardiac patchy opacity, likely atelectasis. There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema, most significant at the bases, which is slightly improved. There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
