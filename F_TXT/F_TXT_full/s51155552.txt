Comparison is made with prior study, ___. Cardiomegaly is stable. There are low lung volumes. ET tube is in standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. Catheter projects in the left upper quadrant. Right subclavian catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction. Peripheral bilateral lung opacities have almost completely resolved. Left lower lobe opacity is minimally increased, likely a combination of atelectasis and small effusion. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded. There is mild pulmonary edema.
