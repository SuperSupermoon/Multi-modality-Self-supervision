Comparison is made to prior study from ___. The endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and right-sided central line are in unchanged position. There is increased density within the right upper lobe, which may be due to right upper lobe collapse versus loculated pleural fluid. A right basilar pleural effusion is also seen. Left lung is grossly clear. No pneumothoraces are present.
