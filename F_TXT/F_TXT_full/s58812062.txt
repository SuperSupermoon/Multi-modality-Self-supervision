As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. Subsequently, there are relatively extensive areas of newly appeared parenchymal atelectasis, both in the retrocardiac region and at the right lung bases. Short-term followup should be performed to rule out potentially coexisting pneumonia in these areas. No pleural effusions. Mild fluid overload. Known deviation of the trachea to the left. Mild cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax. The right PICC line is in unchanged position. The nasogastric tube has been removed in the interval.
