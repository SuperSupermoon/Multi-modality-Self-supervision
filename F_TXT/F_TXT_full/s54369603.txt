As compared to the previous radiograph, the left internal jugular vein catheter has been pulled back. The line now projects over the mid SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The right pectoral Port-A-Cath is unchanged in position. The size of the cardiac silhouette and the valvular calcifications are constant in appearance. The position of the patient has changed, with resulting different projection. However, there is a minimal increase in vascular diameters, potentially reflecting mild pulmonary edema. Short-term radiographic monitoring should be performed.
