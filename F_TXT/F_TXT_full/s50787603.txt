The left PICC tip remains within the lower SVC. Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position. Patient is status post median sternotomy, aortic and mitral valve replacement, and CABG. Moderate cardiomegaly persists, and diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta are noted. Mediastinal contour is relatively unchanged with central venous vascular congestion. There is mild to moderate pulmonary edema, not substantially changed considering differences in positioning. Hazy opacification in the right lung is compatible with a layering right pleural effusion, likely small to moderate in size. There is likely a trace left pleural effusion as well. Patchy opacities in lung bases may reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam.
