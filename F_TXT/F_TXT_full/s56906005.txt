There is rightward rotation of the patient. Allowing for changes due to patient positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouettes are unchanged. The bilateral hila are normal. The previously seen right basilar opacity appears more prominent, however, this may simply reflect change in position of now layering effusion in conjunction with lower lung volumes and differences in radiographic technique in comparison to prior exam; however, in the appropriate clinical setting, this could also be compatible with sequela of aspiration or pneumonia. There is stable appearance of left basilar atelectasis. Otherwise, there are no focal lung consolidations. Again seen is a small right pleural effusion, now layering posteriorly. There is no left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion.
