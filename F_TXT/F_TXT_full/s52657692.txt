A single portable AP semi-upright view of the chest is obtained. There is interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous catheter with tip near the confluence of the internal jugular and right subclavian veins. Although the trachea appears narrower than before, a prior CT torso from ___ showed displacement of the right innominate vein from the trachea; therefore, the increased distance between the right IJ line and the trachea need not be due to a hematoma. Lungs are clear. No effusion or pneumothorax.
