Moderate residual pulmonary edema in the left lung is unchanged. Heterogeneous opacification in both lower lungs is stable. Right hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated. Pleural effusion is presumed, but probably not substantial. Heart size top-normal. Mediastinal veins only mildly distended. ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach, but neither the most proximal side port new nor the tip is visible.
