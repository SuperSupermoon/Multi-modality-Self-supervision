Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.4 cm from carina. An enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, through the stomach, and off the inferior borders of the film. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is demonstrated. Left perihilar opacity is associated with left upper lobe volume loss, and is concerning for underlying malignancy. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, asymmetrically pronounced on the left. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Lungs appear hyperinflated with probable emphysematous changes in the right apex.
