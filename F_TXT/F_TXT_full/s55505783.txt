As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Two central venous access lines on the right and right pleural drain. Minimal increase in extent of remnant right pleural effusion with subsequent areas of atelectasis, but no new parenchymal opacities. Signs of mild pulmonary edema continues to be present. Moderate cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax.
