The patient is intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina, beyond the thoracic inlet. The heart is moderately enlarged, as before. The mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. The lung volumes are low. Streaky basilar opacities suggest minor atelectasis. There is also mild upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vascularity, but without findings suggestive of frank congestive heart failure. There is no definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
