As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone right-sided VATS intervention. A right chest tube is in expected position. There is an approximately 2-3 mm apicolateral pneumothorax on the right, without evidence of tension. Overall, the lung volumes have decreased, which visually exaggerates bilateral areas of atelectasis. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette, no pleural effusions.
