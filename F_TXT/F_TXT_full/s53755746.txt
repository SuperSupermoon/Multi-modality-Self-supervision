Portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal contours. There is stable mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette. There has been interval increase in diffuse alveolar opacities with a basilar predomince, left greater than right with loss of left hemidiaphragm silhouette. Given multiple prior studies demonstrating rapid increase and decrease of opacification and previously provided history of cocaine use, findings suggest acute non-cardiac pulmonary edema versus pulmonary toxicity.
