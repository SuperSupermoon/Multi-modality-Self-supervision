Two chest tubes remain in place in the right hemithorax. Circumferential right pleural opacity corresponding to a combination of pleural thickening and pleural fluid appear relatively similar to the prior radiograph. Adjacent lung opacities remain most marked within the right middle and right lower lobe and show only slight improved aeration in these regions. Diffuse interstitial pattern in right lung could reflect lymphangitic carcinomatosis given the history of malignancy. A persistent small left effusion is present.
