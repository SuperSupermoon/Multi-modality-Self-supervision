An endotracheal tube is in unchanged position, 3.5 cm from the carina. An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of field of view. The right internal jugular central venous catheter is present with the tip in the mid SVC. Again, there are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, similar to the prior exam. Bilateral, predominantly perihilar interstitial and parenchymal opacities are similar to the prior exam. There is no new opacity. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours are normal. The heart size is difficult to determine given the adjacent effusions.
