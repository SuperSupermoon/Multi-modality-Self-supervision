In comparison with the study of ___, the bilateral pigtail catheters remain in place. No substantial effusion or pneumothorax. The lung volumes have decreased. Prominence of interstitial markings is again consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with some volume loss in the left lower lobe and there again is blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally. And surgical clips are again seen in the left axillary region.
