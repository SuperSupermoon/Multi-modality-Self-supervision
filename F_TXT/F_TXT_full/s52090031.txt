In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a temporary hemodialysis line that extends to the level of the cavoatrial junction. No evidence of pneumothorax. The hazy opacification in the right hemithorax consistent with layering pleural effusion is much less prominent on the current study. This could reflect improved pleural effusion, though it may merely be a manifestation of a more upright position of the patient. Otherwise little change.
