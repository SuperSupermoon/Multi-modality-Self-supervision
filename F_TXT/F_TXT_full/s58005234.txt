When compared to previous exam, there has been no significant interval change. Right-sided Port-A-Cath is seen with tip in the right atrium. Relatively low lung volumes are again noted. Bilateral interstitial opacities with more focal regions of consolidation in the right upper lobe, bilateral perihilar and basilar distribution are again noted. Least small bilateral pleural effusions are noted with blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally.
