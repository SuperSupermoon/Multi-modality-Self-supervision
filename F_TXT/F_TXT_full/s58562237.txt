Stable cardiomegaly and widening of the vascular pedicle accompanied by worsening congestive heart failure with increasing perihilar edema. More confluent asymmetrical opacity in the left retrocardiac region is noted and could reflect a combination of dependent edema, atelectasis and effusion, but superimposed infection is also possible in the setting of sepsis. Moderate left and small right pleural effusions have increased in size since the recent study.
