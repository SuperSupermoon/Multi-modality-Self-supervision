Portable AP chest radiograph. The patient is rotated to the right. This causes the cardiomediastinal silhouette to obscure the right lung base. A repeat radiograph with better positioning would help exclude an underlying consolidation. There is mild edema and possibly small effusions. There is no pneumothorax. The heart is moderately enlarged.
