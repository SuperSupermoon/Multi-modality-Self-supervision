Lung volumes are appreciably lower today than after optimal inspiration on previous radiographs, but not appreciably changed since ___.

Conventional chest radiographs would be helpful in trying to make that distinction. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. Left PIC line ends in the low SVC.
