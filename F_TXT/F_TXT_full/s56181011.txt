ET tube terminates 3.2 cm from the carina. Enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm with side port likely in the stomach and tip beyond the field of view. There is large left retrocardiac opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm likely reflecting some combination of pleural effusion, atelectasis and possible pneumonia. There is no large pneumothorax. The right lung is essentially clear. There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
