Multifocal areas of consolidation involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left with associated foci of cavitation appears similar to the recent chest radiograph except for the left retrocardiac region, which shows some interval improved aeration. Findings are consistent with history of MRSA pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size in the interval. There is no visible pneumothorax.
