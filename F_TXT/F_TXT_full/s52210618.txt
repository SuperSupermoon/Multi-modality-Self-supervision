Lung volumes are low. Heart size is moderately enlarged but accentuated by the low lung volumes. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion with ill-defined patchy opacities in the lung bases, possibly atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. There may be trace bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. Left subclavian vascular stent is in unchanged position.
