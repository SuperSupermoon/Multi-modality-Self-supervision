Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved. Widened mediastinum has improved. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. There are low lung volumes. There are probably small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. Right central catheter tip is in the lower SVC. There is no evident pneumothorax.
