As compared to the previous image, all monitoring and support devices have been removed, with the exception of the right internal jugular vein catheter. As expected, the lung volumes have decreased. There is mild fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema. Atelectasis is present at the right lung bases. No larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
