Single portable view of the chest. ET, enteric, and right PICC are in stable positions. New right IJ line is seen with tip at the SVC/RA junction. There is no pneumothorax. Low lung volumes again noted, with crowding of the bronchovascular markings. More focal opacity at the left lung base is likely due to atelectasis.
