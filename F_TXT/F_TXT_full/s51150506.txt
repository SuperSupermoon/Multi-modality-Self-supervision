Single semi-upright portable AP view of the chest was obtained. The lungs remain hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patchy right basilar, possibly right middle lobe opacity is seen, raising concern for underlying pneumonia possibly due to infection or aspiration. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stable and unremarkable. Previously seen right-sided PICC is no longer seen.
