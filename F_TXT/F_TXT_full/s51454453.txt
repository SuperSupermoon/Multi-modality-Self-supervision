There is a persistent left basilar opacity with an associated small pleural effusion which would be concerning for pneumonia or aspiration in the correct clinical setting. Lower lobe atelectasis could also have this appearance. Clinical correlation is recommended. Streaky opacities at the right base in the setting of the low lung volumes suggests atelectasis. No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. Given the low lung volumes, it is difficult to assess the cardiac and mediastinal contours for any interval change.
