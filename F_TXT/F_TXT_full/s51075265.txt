Position of endotracheal tube and right-sided Swan-Ganz is unchanged. NG tube projects over the stomach. Sternotomy wires and outline of artificial mitral valve noted. Heart is moderately enlarged as before. Mild bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged. Bilateral patchy lung opacifications, likely represent atelectasis and crowding of pulmonary vasculature secondary to low volumes. No focal areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
