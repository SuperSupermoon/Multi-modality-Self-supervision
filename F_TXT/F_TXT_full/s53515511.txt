CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. There are low inspiratory volumes. Allowing for this, the appearance is similar to the film obtained at 12:03 p.m. the same day. Lines and tubes are unchanged, in satisfactory position. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is present, likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary vasculature is also likely accentuated by low lung volumes. No pneumothorax detected.
