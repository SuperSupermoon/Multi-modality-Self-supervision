In comparison to previous radiograph of 2 days earlier, right hemidiaphragm is further elevated with associated worsening atelectasis in the right middle and right lower lobes. Marked rightward patient rotation limits overall assessment, and repeat, nonrotated radiograph is recommended for more complete assessment. Left lower lobe atelectasis has nearly resolved and a left pleural effusion has apparently decreased in size. Pulmonary vascular congestion persists.
