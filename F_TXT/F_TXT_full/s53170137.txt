Single AP view of the chest was reviewed. Since the recent prior study, there has been interval placement of an intended left internal jugular line with tip not clearly in a central vein. The ET tube now resides in the trachea with tip approximately 1.8 cm from the carina. The more distal aspect of the enteric tube is captured on this film, and the sideholes are clearly in the stomach. There has been interval rapid progression of opacification of the right lung, especially the right upper lobe, concerning for aspiration with atelectasis, hemorrhage, or possibly severe mitral regurgitation.
