Compared with ___ at 19:14 there is more focal irregular consolidation at the right lung base. However, the appearance is similar to ___ at 08:00 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is a right PICC line with tip overlying the distal most SVC. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. Extensive increased interstitial markings in both lungs again noted. Before, the right hemidiaphragm is elevated. No pneumothorax is detected. Small right effusion would be difficult to exclude. No gross left effusion. Doubt CHF. Presence or absence of pericardial effusion would be difficult to evaluate in this setting.
