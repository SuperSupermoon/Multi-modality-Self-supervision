The aorta is tortuous and calcified. The heart is normal in size. The lungs demonstrate patchy opacity in the right upper lobe that has increased since the prior radiographs although difficult to compare to the more recent CT. This appearance may reflect areas of increased mucous plugging associated with suspected lower airway infection or atypical infection. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
