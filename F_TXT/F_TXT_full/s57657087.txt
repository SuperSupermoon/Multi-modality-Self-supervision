As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The lung volumes have decreased and there is increased crowding at the lung bases as well as mild retrocardiac atelectasis. However, short-term followup radiograph should be performed to exclude the possibility for pneumonia. No fluid overload. No pleural effusions. No other relevant changes.
