The endotracheal tube has been repositioned, with the tip terminating 3.8 cm above the level of the carina. A new right internal jugular catheter terminates at the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax is evident. Increasing interstitial opacities suggest developing pulmonary edema especially given the moderate cardiomegaly and distension of the azygous vein. No large pleural effusions are evident. Consolidation within the left lung base has progressed, possibly due to progressive atelectasis, though pneumonia and aspiration are also within the differential. Apparent widening of the Mediastinal and hilar contours is likely secondary to the supine technique.
