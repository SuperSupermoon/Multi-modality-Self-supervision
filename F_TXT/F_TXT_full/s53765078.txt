The endotracheal tube terminates 1.5 cm above the carina. The Swan-Ganz catheter terminates at the right ventricular outflow tract. A new right apical thoracostomy tube is present. A right basilar chest tube is unchanged in position. Orogastric tube and left thoracostomy tube are unchanged in orientation. The patient is post CABG. A loculated right pleural effusion has markedly decreased in size. There is no pneumothorax. The central right perihilar opacity may reflect focal edema versus consolidation. Short-term followup radiograph recommended.
