Single portable view of the chest. There are an irregular perihilar opacities bilaterally which are present on prior chest CT but have developed since prior chest x-ray. These could be related post radiation changes although recurrent tumor is also possible. Increased interstitial markings more conspicuous at the left lung base with possible more confluent consolidation in the retrocardiac region. New nodular opacity also seen at the left lung base not identified on prior CT. Blunting of the costophrenic angles most suggestive of effusions. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and again notable for right paratracheal adenopathy.
