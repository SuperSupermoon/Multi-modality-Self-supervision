The patient has been intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 5 cm above the carina. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable. A very small pleural effusion is possible on the right. The left costophrenic sulcus appears sharp. There is no pneumothorax. Aeration of the upper lungs has improved after intubation, but there is still a mild interstitial abnormality including bronchovascular thickening. The appearance suggests improvement in pulmonary edema.
