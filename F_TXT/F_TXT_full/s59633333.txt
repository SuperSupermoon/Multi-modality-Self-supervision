Single portable view of the chest. Posttreatment changes project over the right lower lung with fiducial marker and distortion of the underlying lung parenchyma with linear opacities. Some of this is also attributed to the right middle lobe atelectasis identified on prior CT. At the left lung base there also areas of relatively linear opacity obscuring the heart border. Superiorly the lungs are clear. No acute osseous abnormality identified.
