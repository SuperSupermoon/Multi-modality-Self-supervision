There are low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. Trace pleural effusions were better assessed on CT. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Slight prominence of the right peritracheal mediastinum is similar and may be due to prominent vasculature. No underlying lymphadenopathy was seen on CT. No pneumothorax is seen. No overt pulmonary edema is seen.
