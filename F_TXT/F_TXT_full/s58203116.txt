The ET tube ends 3 cm above the level of the carina. The NG tube passes below the level of the diaphragm and likely out of the field of view inferiorly. Lung volumes are low, causing exaggeration of the heart size and accentuation of the pulmonary vasculature. There is marked retrocardiac atelectasis. The heart is moderately enlarged allowing for AP technique. There is a left apical cap and moderate left pleural effusion. There is no definite right pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen.
