Compared with the prior film, the right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter has been repositioned, with the tip now overlying the proximal right pulmonary artery. The right sided central line is unchanged, tip overlying cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, but stable, allowing for technical differences. The right and left lung bases are grossly clear, except for some patchy retrocardiac opacity, which appears improved. No gross effusion identified on either side.
