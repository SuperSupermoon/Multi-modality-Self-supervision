Since the previous radiograph, there is new appearance of a muild post-operative pneumopericardium. The overall size of the cardiac silhouette is not enlarged as compared to previous examination. The appearance of the lung parenchyma is not changed. The monitoring and support devices are constant, with an endotracheal tube that is positioned rather high and could be advanced by 1 to 2 cm. No evidence of pneumothorax or larger pleural effusions.
