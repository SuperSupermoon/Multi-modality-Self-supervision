1. Right internal jugular line has its tip in the mid to distal SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. Lung volumes remain markedly low with increasing opacity at the left base and a stable patchy opacity at the right base. There are likely layering effusions, left greater than right. The findings most likely reflect bibasilar patchy atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Vascular crowding is seen, likely related to low lung volumes with no overt pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is appreciated. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess given the markedly low lung volumes.
