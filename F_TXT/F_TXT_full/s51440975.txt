AP chest compared to ___: Severe extensive bilateral pulmonary consolidation is still worse in the right lung than the left but the left is worsening as well. Substantial right pleural effusion layers posteriorly. The heart is not enlarged. Left pleural effusion is small. Findings are most likely due to a combination of pulmonary edema and possibly a second process such as diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage or even pneumonia. I doubt that the edema is strictly cardiogenic since heart size is small and mediastinal veins are only mildly dilated. No pneumothorax.
