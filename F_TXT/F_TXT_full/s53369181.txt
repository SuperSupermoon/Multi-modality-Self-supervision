In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is increasing indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with worsening pulmonary edema. Substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. Hemodialysis catheter remains in good position. The left hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and probable small pleural effusion.
