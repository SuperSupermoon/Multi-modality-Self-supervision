AP portable view of the chest. Pleural thickening, possibly calcified, which blunts the right costophrenic sulcus with mild right hemidiaphragm elevation is unchanged. There is a new small left pleural effusion. There is mild cardiomegaly and cephalization of vessels consistent with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No definite consolidation suggestive of pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
