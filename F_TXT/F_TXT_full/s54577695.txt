In comparison with the study of ___, the left subclavian catheter has been removed. There is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with worsening pulmonary edema. More patchy areas of confluence of opacification could reflect developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Left hemidiaphragm is poorly seen and there is hazy opacification at the left base, consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Nasogastric tube remains in place.
