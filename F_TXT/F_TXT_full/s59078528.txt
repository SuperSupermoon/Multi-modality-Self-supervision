Comparison is made to prior radiographs performed 11 hours earlier. There is a right-sided central venous line with distal lead tip at the right atrium; however, this may be partially positional. Endotracheal tube has been removed. The study is very limited due to the patient's chin and mass obscuring the upper chest and there are low lung volumes due to poor inspiratory effort. There remains atelectasis and a left retrocardiac opacity. Would recommend repeat of images if there is high clinical concern for pathology; however, there is likely no interval change since the previous study.
