Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___. Heart size is mildly enlarged but stable. Mediastinal calcified lymph nodes are unchanged. Lungs are clear except for minimal opacity at the left lower lung adjacent to the left heart border that although might represent atelectasis, in relatively immunosuppressed patients might reflect developing infectious process. In this specific case, correlation with chest CT is recommended.
