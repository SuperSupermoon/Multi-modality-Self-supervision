There has been interval repositioning of a left-sided chest tube with the tip terminating near the left lower lung. Re-expansion of the left lung persists with only a tiny amount of pneumothorax seen in the apex. There is a new enlarging consolidation in the left lower lobe. The right lung is clear. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
