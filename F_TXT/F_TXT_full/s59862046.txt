AP chest compared to 5:10 a.m.: Pulmonary edema has improved if not resolved, but extensive consolidation persists in the left lung, and to a lesser degree at the right lung base medially. Findings point to extensive pneumonia, as discussed with the house officer caring for this patient at 10:30 a.m. Feeding tube ends in the distal stomach. Right PICC line ends low in the SVC. Heart size is probably normal. Pleural effusions if any are small. No pneumothorax.
