AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained two hours earlier during the same day. In the interval, a left-sided pigtail and pleural drainage catheter have been placed and introduced through the lower left lateral chest wall. On this AP view, the pigtail end is seen positioned just above the left diaphragmatic cupola. This indicates position in the pleural space. In comparison with the previous study, the drain must have eliminated some of the left-sided pleural effusion, as the blunting of the pleural space has clearly decreased. No new pulmonary abnormalities are seen. The left lung tissue remains aerated. Possibility of small loculated pneumothorax in the lower area is likely. Observe that the pigtail catheter was placed to the area where at least two local rib fractures are seen. Right-sided chest findings are unaltered.
