Cardiac silhouette is normal in size and demonstrates left ventricular configuration. Aorta is tortuous. Severe upper lobe predominant emphysema is again demonstrated, as well as multifocal linear scarring in the mid and lower lungs. Hazy opacities at the lung bases probably represent small pleural effusions with adjacent basilar atelectasis. Other lower lobe process such as aspiration or developing pneumonia are also possible in the appropriate clinical setting, and short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
