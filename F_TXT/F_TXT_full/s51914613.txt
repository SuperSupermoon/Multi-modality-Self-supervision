As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Unchanged course and position of the left-sided chest tube and the left subclavian catheter. Minimal left basal atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The subtle parenchymal changes at the right lung bases are constant.
