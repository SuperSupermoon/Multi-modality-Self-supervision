Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. There is increased haziness in the right lung with opacities in the right greater than left base, appearance suggestive of asymmetric edema, versus aspiration or infection. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. Post-operative changes of CABG and median sternotomy appear unremarkable. Moderate right greater than left shoulder degenerative disease is present. No definite displaced osseous injury is evident.
