Left-sided internal jugular central venous catheter is seen terminating in the proximal SVC/SVC brachiocephalic junction. Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is seen, which may be due to the left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, consolidation is not excluded. There is hazy opacity projecting over the left perihilar region which could relate to a layering pleural effusion, however, may also relate to asymmetric pulmonary edema and/or infection. A right infrahilar opacity is seen which is nonspecific but additional site of infection or aspiration is not excluded. No pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
