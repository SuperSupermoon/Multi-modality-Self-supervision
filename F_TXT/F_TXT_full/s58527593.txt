Left-sided AICD /pacemaker seen device is noted with leads terminating in right atrium and right ventricle. Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications. Lung volumes are low. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits without evidence of pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Widening of the right paratracheal stripe is likely related to low lung volumes. There are no acute osseous abnormalities. Mild deformity of the mid shaft of the left clavicle may suggest a remote healed fracture. No free air is noted under the diaphragms.
