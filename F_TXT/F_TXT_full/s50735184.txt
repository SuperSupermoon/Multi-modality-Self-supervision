Portable semi-upright frontal radiograph of the chest reveals increased interstitial markings bilaterally and persistent hazy opacity at the periphery of the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure, possibly representing mild interstitial pulmonary edema superimposed on a background of chronic interstitial abnormality and emphysematous changes. No new focal airspace opacity is appreciated. The right costophrenic sulcus is not included on this image. The heart size is slightly enlarged, stable. The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax detected. Median sternotomy wires are in place.
