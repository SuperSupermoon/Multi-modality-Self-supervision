As compared to ___, a small right apical pneumothorax is similar to prior study. Hazy increased opacity with oblique orientation A in the right mid lung probably represents loculated pleural fluid. New patchy right retrocardiac opacity could reflect atelectasis, aspiration, and less likely developing pneumonia. Short-term followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.
