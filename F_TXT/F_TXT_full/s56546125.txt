In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been the development of increased opacification in the right mid zone, consistent with pneumonia. The remainder of the study shows the heart to be within upper limits of normal in size. Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels at the bases suggest some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
