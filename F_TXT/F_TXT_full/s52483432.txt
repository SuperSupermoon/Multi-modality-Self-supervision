Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates stable prominent interstitial markings bilaterally without any focal consolidation or superimposed edema. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. The left-sided PICC line ends at the approximate level of the cavoatrial junction. The temporary pacing wire projects over the right atrium, headed towards the right ventricle. No pneumothorax. Opacity projecting over the expected location of the right renal shadow likely represents contrast in the right renal collecting system.
