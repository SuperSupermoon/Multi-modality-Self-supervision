As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation. However, relatively extensive parenchymal opacities at the left lung base, with consolidation and, potentially cavitation, remain unchanged. Also unchanged are faint parenchymal opacities on the right lung base. There is continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, the presence of pericardial effusion should be considered and rule out by echocardiography. The position and course of a right PICC line is constant.
