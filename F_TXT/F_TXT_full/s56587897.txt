The chest tube and mediastinal drains have been removed. The ET tube and Swan-Ganz catheter have also been removed. There is bilateral lower lobe volume loss with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. A small effusion and infiltrate cannot be excluded in this region. There is also an area of opacity in the right lower lobe laterally, compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. The upper lungs are clear.
