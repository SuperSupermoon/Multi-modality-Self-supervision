As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased. The pre-existing opacities at the lung bases have substantially decreased and are barely visible on today's examination. Only small areas of platelike atelectasis persist at both the right and the left lung bases. On the left, a small pleural effusion is visualized. Unchanged appearance of the known right upper lobe calcifications. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.
