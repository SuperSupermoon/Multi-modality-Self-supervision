As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Lung volumes are slightly increased, leading to an apparent decrease in radiodensity of the pre-existing opacities. The extent and severity of the opacities, however, is unchanged. The lung shows no newly appeared parenchymal opacities. No change in appearance of the cardiac silhouette.
