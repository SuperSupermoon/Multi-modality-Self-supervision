As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a new right PICC line, the previously placed subclavian line was removed. The course of the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the mid SVC. There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. The appearance of the mediastinum, the heart and the lung parenchyma is unchanged.
