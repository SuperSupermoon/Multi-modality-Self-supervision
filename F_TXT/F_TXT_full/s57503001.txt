Large left pleural effusion is increased compared to before. Right pleural effusion is small. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by pleural effusion. There is almost complete collapse of the left lung, sparing left lung apex. Mild pulmonary edema is noted in the right lung. Massive dilated esophagus is unchanged. Left upper abdomen catheter is in unchanged position. Left main stem bronchus is patent but distal branches are not visualized, which may reflect bronchial impaction, possibly due to mucous. Lucency under the right hemidiaphragm likely reflect a loop of colon as seen on prior CT.
