Lower lung volumes may explain to some extent the increase in the diameter of the cardiac portion of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, but since there has been a simultaneous and continuing increase in moderate to large bilateral pleural effusion, the possibility of mediastinal or pericardial effusion should be considered. Lower lobes are largely atelectatic due to the effusions. Upper lobes are grossly clear. There is no pneumothorax. Esophageal drainage tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. The upper esophagus is distended with air and fluid.
