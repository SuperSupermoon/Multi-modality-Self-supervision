AP chest compared to ___, 9:08 p.m.: One nasogastric feeding tube passes into the distal stomach or proximal duodenum where it is sharply folded and could be partially occluded. The other containing the wire stylet is looped in the mid to low esophagus and returns proximally and out of view. Left lower lobe is still collapsed. Right lung is clear. Lung apices are excluded from the examination. The heart is top normal size. Tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 3 cm above the carina. If the chin is elevated, this is too low. Left hemidiaphragm is elevated, either due to or causing the left lower lobe collapse, but re-positioning of the Dobbhoff tube was documented by subsequent chest radiograph available at the time of this dictation and was reported accordingly.
