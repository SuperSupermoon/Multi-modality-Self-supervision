Comparison is made with prior study performed seven hours earlier. Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and post-operative mediastinal widening is grossly unchanged. Right IJ catheter tip is in the right atrium, should be withdrawn for a more standard position. ET tube is in standard position. Mitral ring is noted. There has been interval increase in mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right, small to moderate on the left, have minimally increased. Bibasilar atelectases have worsened, more so on the right. There is no evident pneumothorax.
