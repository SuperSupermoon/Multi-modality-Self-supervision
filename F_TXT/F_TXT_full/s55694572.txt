CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW. Compared with ___, there may be slight increase in the degree of vascular engorgement. Faint opacity along the left chest wall most likely represents overlying soft tissues, though loculated fluid could have a similar appearance. Otherwise, the overall appearance is similar. Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with small left effusion and small right effusion with right base atelectasis and elevated right hemidiaphragm. Known pulmoonary nodules are not readily visible radiographically, but may account for some of the faintly nodular opacities present. Clips noted over the left breast. Stent-type device noted over mid abdomen. Compared to ___, there is definite vascular engorgement, consistent with CHF. The findings at both bases are new since that time.
