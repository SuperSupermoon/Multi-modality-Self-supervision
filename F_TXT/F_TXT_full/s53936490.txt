1. Endotracheal tube now has its tip 3.7 cm above the carina. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. Nasogastric tube courses below diaphragm with tip not identified. The lung volumes remain low with persistent retrocardiac opacity and probable layering effusion consistent with compressive atelectasis. Pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There is also likely patchy atelectasis at the right medial lung base. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contour is stable given differences in patient rotation.
