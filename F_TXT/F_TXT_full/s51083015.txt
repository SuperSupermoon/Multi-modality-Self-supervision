As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right internal jugular vein catheter and has been extubated. The catheter shows a normal course. The tip projects over the mid-to-low SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. The lung volumes remain low, the size of the heart is at the upper range of normal, but there is no overt pulmonary edema and no pneumonia.
