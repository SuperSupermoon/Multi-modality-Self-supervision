Comparison is made to prior study from ___ at 10:09 a.m. There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 6 cm above the carina, appropriately sited. There is a feeding tube whose side port is at the GE junction and this could be advanced approximately 10 cm for more optimal placement. Intra-aortic balloon pump is identified. There are bilateral pleural effusions and left retrocardiac opacity. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema. Heart size is within normal limits. There is some scarring in the lung apices, right slightly greater than left.
