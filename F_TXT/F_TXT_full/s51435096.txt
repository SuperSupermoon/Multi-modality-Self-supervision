AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. A right arm PICC line is again seen with its tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction with its tip obscured due to overlying EKG leads. The patient is rotated to her left, which limits evaluation. The right lung appears clear. There is left basal opacity which obscures the left hemidiaphragm, which could represent a combination of aspiration/pneumonia and effusion. The left upper lung appears reasonably aerated. The left-sided rib fractures are again noted. There is no pneumothorax. The ET and NG tubes have been removed. Overall, since the prior exam, there has been little change.
