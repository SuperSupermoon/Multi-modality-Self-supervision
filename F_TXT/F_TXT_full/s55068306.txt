A frontal AP upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The examination is suboptimal due to poor penetration and patient body habitus. Lung volumes are slightly low, resulting in bronchovascular crowding. The lungs are grossly clear aside from mild bibasilar atelectasis. There is no large effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged allowing for differences in technique. Apparent widening of the mediastinum is likely due to portable technique and low lung volumes. Hilar contours are normal. No acute osseous abnormality is identified on this limited study.
