There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter terminating in the mid to low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.3 cm above the level of the carina. A right-sided PICC is grossly stable in position. Diffuse bilateral opacities again seen worrisome for pulmonary edema, underlying infection not excluded, appears slightly worsened as compared to the prior study, including a more confluent area of opacity in the right upper to mid lung. Probable left pleural effusion persists.
