As compared to the previous radiograph, a relatively substantial left pleural effusion has been drained using a left chest tube. The extent of the effusion has decreased, but remnant effusion is still located at the bases of the left hemithorax. A subsequent left basal atelectasis is unchanged as compared to the previous examination. A linear opacity parallel to the heart border has newly occurred. No overt pneumothorax is visible. Minimal air inclusion at the level of the chest tube insertion.
