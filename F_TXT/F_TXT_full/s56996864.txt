Large left and moderate right layering pleural effusions have increased compared with the prior study. There is no pneumothorax or focal consolidation. Endotracheal tube terminates 8 cm from the carina. A left PICC terminates in the mid SVC, and a right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the distal SVC. Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view. Multiple mediastinal clips are unchanged.
