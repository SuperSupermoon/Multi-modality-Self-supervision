Low lung volumes accentuate the size of the cardiac and mediastinal contours, with the heart size appearing moderately enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. Widening of the superior mediastinal contour, particularly the right may be due to the presence of mediastinal fat and prominent vessels. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is noted, without overt pulmonary edema. Patchy opacities in the left lung base may reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified on this supine exam. Mild degenerative changes are seen in the left glenohumeral joint. No central venous catheter is demonstrated.Patient is status post kyphoplasty at the thoracolumbar junction.
