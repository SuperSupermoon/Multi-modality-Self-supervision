Coarse bilateral interstitial opacities are consistent with patient's known interstitial lung disease. There is minimally increased prominence of pulmonary vasculature and heart size compared to prior, possibly secondary to slightly lower lung volumes and/or interval hydration/fluid overload. Mild congestive heart failure cannot be excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Underlying interstitial lung disease slightly limits evaluation for pneumonia, but no new large opacities are detected. Aortic calcification is again seen. A nasogastric tube traverses below the diaphragm, distal tip not well seen.
