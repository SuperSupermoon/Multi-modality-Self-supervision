Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates the ET tube in stable position. The NG tube tip is within the stomach. A right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. Severe pulmonary edema is unchanged along with a mild pleural effusion on the right. There likely is also a small effusion on the left with possible left basilar atelectasis. Severe cardiomegaly is also unchanged.
