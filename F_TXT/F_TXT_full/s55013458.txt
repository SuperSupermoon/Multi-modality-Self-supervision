In comparison to the prior exam, there is no significant change. Heart is mildly enlarged. Lung volumes are again low. There is no overt sign of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. An opacity in the right middle lobe which silhouettes the heart border and may represent pneumonia in the correct clinical setting, however it is likely atelectasis given the low lung volumes. A new right IJ line terminates in the high SVC.
