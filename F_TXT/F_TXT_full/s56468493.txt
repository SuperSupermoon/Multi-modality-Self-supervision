Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.2 cm above the level of the carina. Enteric tube terminates in the distal esophagus and should be advanced so that it is well within the stomach. Subtle medial right base opacity persists, again could be due to infection, aspiration, or atelectasis. No focal consolidation is seen on the left. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
