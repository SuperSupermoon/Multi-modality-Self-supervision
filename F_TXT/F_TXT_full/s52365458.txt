Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube with its tip at the level of the clavicular heads. An NG tube passes through the stomach, and a right subclavian central venous catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction. There is an interval decrease in lung volumes; small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis is mild and increased. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged and unchanged. The mediastinal contours are little changed. Pulmonary vasculature is normal and improved.
