Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion and improving asymmetrical pattern of pulmonary edema involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left.

Worsening left retrocardiac opacity is most likely due to atelectasis given associated inferior displacement of the left hilum and adjacent pleural effusion.
