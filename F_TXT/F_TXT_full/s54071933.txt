A new right internal jugular sheath terminates near the confluence of the internal jugular and subclavian veins. A left subclavian catheter terminates in the lower SVC. An endotracheal tube is 2 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses along the esophagus and terminates out of the field of view, likely within the stomach. The lungs are better expanded, which results in an improved appearance of both the mediastinum and cardiac silhouette. There is prominence of the central vasculature with mild pulmonary edema. There is no pleural effusion. The previously seen rounded opacity at the right lung base is no longer visualized. There is no pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation. There is no free air seen on this semi erect radiograph.
