Evaluation is somewhat limited due to multiple overlying lines and tubes. However, the endotracheal tube appears appropriately positioned within the mid trachea. An enteric tube is visualized with the tip at the gastric fundus. The lungs are clear with no evidence of consolidation, effusions, or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal. Postsurgical changes are noted with an anterior fusion of cervical spine.
