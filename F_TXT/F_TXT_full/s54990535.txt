In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels consistent with mild fluid overload. Blunting of the costophrenic angles persists. Left hemidiaphragm is not as well seen as on previous studies, raising the possibility of increasing volume loss in the lower lobe. Upper lungs are clear.
