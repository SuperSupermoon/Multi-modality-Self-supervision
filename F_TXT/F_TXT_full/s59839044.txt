AP portable upright view of the chest. Endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing 3.1 cm above the carinal. Orogastric tube descends into the left upper abdomen with its tip not within the imaged field. Lung volumes are low likely accounting for the subtle hazy opacities in the lower lungs. No convincing sign of consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax. An azygous fissure is noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. No bony injury abnormalities.
