Greater opacification is present in both lower hemi thoraces. Some of the difference is due to a change in patient position from semi-erect to supine with more vascular congestion and more cephalad layering of pleural effusions as a result. Nevertheless I think the heart is larger, pulmonary vascular congestion is worse, pleural effusions are larger and there is increasing perihilar edema, all pointing toward relative cardiac decompensation. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric tube ends in a nondistended stomach. Left jugular line ends in the left brachiocephalic vein. An esophageal measurement probe ends above the level of the larynx. Clinical correlation advised. Sharp definition of the ET cuff reflects secretions pooling above it that need to be suctioned.
