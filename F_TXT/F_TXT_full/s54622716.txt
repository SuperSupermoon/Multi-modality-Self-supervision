Right subclavian PICC line remains unchanged in position. There are slightly worsening bilateral layering pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities likely reflecting compressive lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded. Slight interval improvement in mild interstitial edema. Due to marked patient rotation, assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is not possible on this study. No pneumothorax.
