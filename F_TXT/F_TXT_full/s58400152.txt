Linear opacities within the left mid lung are similar to prior and likely reflect scarring. Lung volumes are low, however, no confluent consolidation is identified. There is no pulmonary edema or large pleural effusions. Moderate enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears similar to prior examination and is consistent with recent CABG. Enlargement of the thoracic aorta is similar to multiple priors. Median sternotomy wires are intact. There is no pneumothorax. Again noted is a prosthetic aortic valve in unchanged position. Deviation of the trachea to the right is unchanged from prior and consistent with known thyroid enlargement seen on prior CT.
