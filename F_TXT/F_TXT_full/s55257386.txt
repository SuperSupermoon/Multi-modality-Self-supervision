Single semi upright AP portable chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube, its tip which terminates approximately 4.9 cm above the level of the carina in appropriate position. An enteric tube descends the thorax in uncomplicated course, its tip below the level of the hemidiaphragm projecting over the left upper quadrant, new since prior study. Relative to prior study, there is improved aeration of the left hemithorax. There persists a large opacification at the left lung base with mild shift of mediastinal structures leftward to suggest a component of volume loss. The right costophrenic angle is incompletely imaged. There is no large pneumothorax.
