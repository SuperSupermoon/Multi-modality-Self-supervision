Compared to the prior exam, lung volumes are slightly lower. Streaky linear like opacities in the bilateral lower lungs most likely reflects atelectasis. Additional opacity in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe is not well evaluated in the setting of right hemi diaphragmatic elevation and single portable projection.. No pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. The heart is normal in size. The mediastinum is not widened. The patient is slightly rotated. Contiguous old right posterior rib fractures are noted. The ninth posterior rib fracture does not demonstrate significant callus formation.
