The tip of the endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina in appropriate position. The tip of the orogastric tube is not clearly identified but the side port is below the GE junction. There is mild pulmonary edema with areas of more patchy opacity at the lung bases, slightly more pronounced since the prior study. Emphysematous changes are seen at the apices bilaterally. The heart is mildly enlarged. No large pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen. A remote right distal clavicular fracture is again identified. Multiple bilateral rib fractures appear subacute to chronic.
