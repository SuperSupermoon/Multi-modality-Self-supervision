There is persistent mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and bandlike atlectasis in the left lower lung. In comparison to the prior study however, there is improved overall aeration of the left lung. Persistent left perihilar opacities are in part due to pulmonary vascular crowding and atelectasis, though resolving contusion may also be a component. The right lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Multiple fractures involving the left ribcage, left mid shaft clavicle and the left scapula are better evaluated on recent CT. The endotracheal tube terminates 7.5 cm above the carina and should be advanced by 2 cm for optimal placement. The enteric tube is curled in the stomach directed towards the fundus. Left chest tubes unchanged in position.
