A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The patient is rotated to the right. The previously seen right basilar opacity has improved. No new opacity is seen. There is left basilar scarring. A small left pleural effusion is new. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged allowing for differences in rotation. Old left rib fractures are noted.
