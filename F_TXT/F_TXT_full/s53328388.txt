A linear lucency through the right clavicle is consistent with a non-displaced fracture. No other fractures identified. A rounded lucency in the right second rib is better evaluated on the concurrent CT of the torso. The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
