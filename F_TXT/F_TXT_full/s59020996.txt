Pigtail pleural catheter has been exchanged for a Pleurx catheter in the left hemithorax. Moderate left pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size with slight improvement of adjacent opacities in the left mid and lower lung. Within the right hemithorax, a small right pleural effusion has slightly increased in size, and juxtahilar linear atelectasis has worsened. Subcutaneous emphysema in left supraclavicular region is new, and a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema is also seen in the left chest wall near the external portion of the Pleurx catheter.
