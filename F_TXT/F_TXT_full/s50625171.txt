Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance. Severe upper lobe predominant emphysema is again demonstrated. New linear opacities have developed in the right mid and both lower lungs, most consistent with areas of subsegmental atelectasis. Otherwise, no relevant change since the recent study. A feeding tube remains in place, with slightly more proximal location than before. The proximal portion of the radiodense tip is likely proximal to the gastroesophageal junction and could be advanced a few centimeters for standard positioning.
