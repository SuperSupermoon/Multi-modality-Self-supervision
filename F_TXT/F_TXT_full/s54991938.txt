Portable supine AP chest radiograph is obtained. Endotracheal tube is seen with its tip located approximately 5 cm above the carina. NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen. Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities, which are most compatible with pulmonary edema. A right pleural effusion is noted, moderate in volume. There may be a tiny left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Heart size difficult to evaluate though is at least top normal. Widening of the mediastinum is likely due to supine portable technique. The imaged osseous structures are intact.
