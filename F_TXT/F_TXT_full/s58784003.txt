Single frontal chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable hilar contours. Atherosclerotic calcifications are present in the aortic arch. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. There are bibasilar opacifications, left greater than right which may represent atelectasis though superimposed infectious process or aspiration is not excluded. No pneumothorax identified. Mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles suggests small bilateral pleural effusions. Multilevel degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
