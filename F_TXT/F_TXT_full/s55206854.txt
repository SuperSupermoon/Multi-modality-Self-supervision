Right-sided pleural effusion is again seen largely unchanged. There is left-sided ground glass opacity which has slightly improved consistent with improving pulmonary edema. Endotracheal tube is seen in appropriate position, 6 cm from the carina. NG tube is seen entering the stomach and out of field of view. Incidental note of right lateral pleural calcification which is better seen on CT imaging.
