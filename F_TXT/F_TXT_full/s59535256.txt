The ETT is 3.6 cm above the carina. The pacer wire extends from the IJ and projects over the expected location of the right ventricle. NG tube tip is in the stomach. There are bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and small bilateral effusions. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution with ill-defined vascularity compatible with fluid overload. Compared to the study from earlier the same day the pulmonary status appear similar.
