A single portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained. Apparent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is likely related to the technique. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unchanged. Redemonstrated are bilateral central areas of bronchial wall thickening and diffuse bronchiectasis. As compared to the prior study, increased more confluent opacities particularly at the right base and adjacent to the right heart border are concerning for infection. No large effusion or pneumothorax.
