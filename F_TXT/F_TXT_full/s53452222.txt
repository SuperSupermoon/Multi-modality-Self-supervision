Supine portable radiograph is obtained. Endotracheal tube is satisfactorily positioned within the trachea. Examination was slightly limited by motion with bilateral atelectasis and low lung volumes. No pneumothorax is seen with exaggeration of heart and mediastinal size likely due to supine positioning. Old clavicular fracture is noted.
