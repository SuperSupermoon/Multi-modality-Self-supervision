Single portable view of the chest. Compared with prior there has been essentially complete resolution of bilateral pleural effusions. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be due to trace effusion. The lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation to suggest infection or aspiration. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Median sternotomy wires are again noted. No acute osseous abnormality is detected.
