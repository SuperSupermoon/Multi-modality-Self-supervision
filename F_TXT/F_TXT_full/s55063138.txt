An endotracheal tube terminates 2.8 cm above the carina. An enteric tube passes below the diaphragm, outside the field of view. There is retrocardiac linear atelectasis at the left lung base. Lung volumes are low with associated crowding of the bronchovascular structures. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal. Surgical clips projecting over the with right upper quadrant are presumably related to cholecystectomy. A radiopaque pin projecting over the left lung apex is likely external to the patient.
