As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen. Given a different patient positioning, the distribution of the bilateral pleural effusions is slightly different but there is no overall change in effusions. The drains and the pacemaker leads are in constant position. Moderate cardiomegaly persists. No new parenchymal opacities.
