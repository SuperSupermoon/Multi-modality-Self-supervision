I do not see any appreciably displaced rib fractures except for the right first rib proximally. Lungs are grossly clear. Small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate cardiomegaly are new compared to the ___. Drainage catheter projecting over the right apex and spine presumably relates to spinal surgery.
