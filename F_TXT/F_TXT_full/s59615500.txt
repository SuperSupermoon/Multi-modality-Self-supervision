Patient has severe emphysema. On ___, mild congestive heart failure increased heart size and pleural effusions and engorged the pulmonary vasculature. Subsequently patient has developed heterogeneous pulmonary opacification, most severe in the right lower lobe. I think this is more likely to be pneumonia than asymmetric edema. On the left is even more severe consolidation, indicated by air bronchograms projecting over the heart. This could be more pneumonia or severe left lower lobe atelectasis. Currently the heart is normal size, smaller than it was at its largest. There is no pneumothorax.
