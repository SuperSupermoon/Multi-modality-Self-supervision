Tracheostomy is in standard position. Right internal jugular catheter ends in lower SVC. A small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis is similar to the prior study. Increased opacification of the left chest is predominantly due to a large pleural effusion, obscuring the left lung. Mediastinal veins are not distended. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. No pneumothorax.
