Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. There is new right upper lobe consolidation consistent with aspiration pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis has increased. Mild vascular congestion is stable. If any, there is a small left pleural effusion. NG tube tip is out of view, below the diaphragm. Widened mediastinum due to projection and engorgement of the vessels is unchanged.
