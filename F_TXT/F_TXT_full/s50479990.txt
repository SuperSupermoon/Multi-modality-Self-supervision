Heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is slightly tortuous. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present. Emphysematous changes appear to be present within the upper lobes. More focal patchy opacities are noted in the lung bases which are nonspecific, and could reflect areas of aspiration or infection. No large pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present. Remote right distal clavicular fracture is seen. Multiple bilateral rib fractures also appear subacute to chronic in age.
