In comparison to previous radiograph of ___, a Dobhoff tube has reportedly been replaced, and it courses below the diaphragm with distal tip beyond the field of view. A second portion of the catheter overlies the midline of the chest and is presumably external to the patient. Clinical correlation suggested. No other relevant changes since recent study.
