AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. The left-sided PICC line has been pulled back by a few centimeters and is now seen to terminate just below the level of the carina. This implies a pull-back by approximately 5 cm. The present termination point corresponds to the mid portion of the SVC and excludes the possibility of mechanical contact with cardiac structures. No other new cardiopulmonary vascular abnormalities are identified.
