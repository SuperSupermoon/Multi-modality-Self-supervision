AP chest compared to ___: Lung volumes are lower, accounting for some of the generalized increase in radiodensity in the lungs, since ___ following extubation. Nevertheless, I suspect mild pulmonary edema is present. The large area of consolidation in the right perihilar lung is partially obscured now by increasing moderate right pleural effusion, but it has not improved. Greater opacification at the base of the left lung is most easily explained by increasing atelectasis, but pneumonia could be spreading. Right jugular line ends low in the SVC. Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead in standard placement. Upper enteric feeding tube passes to the second portion of the duodenum. Small left pleural effusion has increased along with the larger right. No pneumothorax.
