Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 6 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube is with side port within the stomach. There are low lung volumes. The heart size is likely mildly enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified. There is widening of the superior mediastinum likely due to supine technique and low lung volumes. Crowding of the bronchovascular structures is present, but no definite pulmonary edema is noted. Ill-defined patchy opacities are noted within the left upper lung field as well as both lower lung fields, which could reflect areas of atelectasis, aspiration, or infection. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
