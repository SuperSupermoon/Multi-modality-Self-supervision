AP chest compared to ___, 5:39 a.m.: There is no pneumothorax on either side and volume of pleural fluid has unchanged, though I am not sure how much there is in the right hemithorax, probably not a large amount on either side. Heart size however has increased slightly and there is increased interstitial pulmonary edema. Bilateral pigtail pleural drains are unchanged in their positions at mid level on both sides of the chest, left subclavian line ends in the mid SVC, right PIC line in the lower. NG tube ends in the upper stomach. ___ was paged at 10:20 at the time the findings were recognized.
