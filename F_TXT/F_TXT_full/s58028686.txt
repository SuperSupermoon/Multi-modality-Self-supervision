The tracheostomy is in place. An endogastric tube courses inferiorly out of the field of view. A left chest tube is in place. A right-sided PICC tip terminates in the mid-to-lower SVC. Diffuse subcutaneous emphysema is seen throughout the visualized soft tissues, limiting assessment of fine detail within the lungs. Within that limitation, there is no apparent large pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The lungs demonstrate some mild retrocardiac atelectasis.
