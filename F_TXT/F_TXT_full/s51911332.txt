AP chest compared to ___ through ___: A horizontal interface just above the right hemidiaphragm has been visible intermittently over the past several weeks. Viewed in coordination with the abdomen CT on ___ I think this is a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion and the lung is largely clear aside from associated atelectasis. Left lung is entirely clear. The heart is mildly enlarged, a chronic finding. Upper mediastinum is widened by tortuous head and neck vessels displacing the trachea slightly to the left. Dual-channel catheter ends in the right heart. No pneumothorax.
