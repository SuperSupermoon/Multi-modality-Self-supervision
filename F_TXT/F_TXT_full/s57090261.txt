In comparison to the prior exam, there is no significant change. The patient is rotated. Again, there is near-complete opacification of the right lung, due to a combination of consolidations and pleural effusion, as better evaluated on the concurrent CT of the chest. There is an opacity at the left base, which is more apparent due to rotation, but likely unchanged from the prior exam. The left upper lobe remains well aerated. An endotracheal tube is present approximately 4 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of view. The right Port-A-Cath is in unchanged position with the tip near the atriocaval junction. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not well evaluated.
