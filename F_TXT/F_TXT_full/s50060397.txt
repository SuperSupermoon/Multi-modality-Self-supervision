The endotracheal tube tip projects 4.5 cm above the carina. No change in the NG tube positioning. Compared with the prior study, moderate left-sided pleural effusion has increased in size, with adjacent compressive atelectasis. Small right pleural effusion is still present. There has been interval improvement in the bilateral multifocal opacities, suggesting they were likely due to pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
