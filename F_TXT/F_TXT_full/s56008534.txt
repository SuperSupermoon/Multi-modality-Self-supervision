CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. There are artifacts overlying the upper lungs. Allowing for this, no pneumothorax is identified. A right subclavian PICC line is present, tip over mid SVC. There is a moderate-sized right effusion and possible small left effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.Stable patchy retrocardiac opacity. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. Compared with ___ at 16:18 p.m. and allowing for differences in positioning, I doubt significant interval change.
