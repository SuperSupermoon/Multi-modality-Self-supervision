Lung volumes are low, exaggerating pulmonary vascular markings. There is minimal interstitial abnormality. A new left pleural effusion is seen. New retrocardiac density and right basilar consolidation most likely represent atelectasis, but aspiration cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is detected. Heart size is difficult to evaluate due to low lung volumes and portable technique. Aortic calcification is seen. Air is noted in the esophagus. Indentation of the right tracheal contour at the level of the thyroid gland raises the possibility of right thyroid enlargement or nodule.
