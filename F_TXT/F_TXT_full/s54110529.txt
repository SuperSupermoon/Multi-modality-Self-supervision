AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study of ___. Moderate cardiac enlargement as before with marked pulmonary congestion with typical perivascular haze mostly on the bases. Beginning central densities indicate development of pulmonary edema. Comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination suggests mild regression of the congestive pattern. No new discrete pulmonary abnormalities are seen. As before, the lateral pleural sinuses are mildly blunted on this portable chest examination suggesting some bilateral pleural effusions of small-to-moderate amount. No pneumothorax in the apical area.
