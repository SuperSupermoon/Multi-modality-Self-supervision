Single portable view of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes. Overall, there is mild pulmonary edema. A right middle lobe opacity is most likely due to the pulmonary edema, although in the correct clinical setting pnuemonia can be considered. Would recommend dieresis and then repeat of the radiograph. If pulmonary embolism is a concern, as indicated on the requisition, CT of the chest is required.
