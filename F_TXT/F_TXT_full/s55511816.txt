A portable AP chest radiograph shows minimal streaky left retrocardiac density suggesting subsegmental atelectasis. Increased distention of the azygos vein compared to an outside study from one day earlier may be related to patient's position and central pulmonary vasculature is not congested. Cardiac contour is unchanged compared to yesterday's exam.
