Low lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly, blunting of both costophrenic sinuses, likely caused by small pleural effusions. Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis and moderate scarring in the mid and lower right lung. Mild pulmonary edema is present. Left pectoral pacemaker is in situ. On the right, parts of an intravascular device are visualized, likely a Port-A-Cath. There is no pneumothorax, but bilateral mild apical thickening is seen. Status post rib fractures on the right is likely. Given the complex and obviously older nature of the lung changes, a lateral radiograph would be important for a more detailed assessment.
