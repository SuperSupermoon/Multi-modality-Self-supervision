In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the appearance of the left pigtail catheter with essentially complete re-expansion of the left lung. There may be a tiny residual apical pneumothorax. The opacifications at the bases are less prominent. This could represent improved atelectasis and pleural effusion, though it may merely be a manifestation of a more erect position of the patient. No evidence of appreciable vascular congestion.
