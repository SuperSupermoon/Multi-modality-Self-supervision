The endotracheal tube ends approximately 3 cm from the carina. A Swan-Ganz catheter overlies the expected area of the main pulmonary artery.

There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Moderate enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. A gastric tube and a coiled Dobbhoff both end in the region of the pylorus.
