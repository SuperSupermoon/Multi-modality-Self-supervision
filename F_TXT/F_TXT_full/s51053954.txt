AP chest compared to 7:37 p.m.: Left subclavian line ends in the upper SVC. No left pneumothorax, pleural effusion or ipsilateral mediastinal widening. Previous right mediastinal or paraspinal fluid collection is probably unchanged, and posteriorly layering right pleural effusion stable. There is considerable atelectasis at the base of the right lung and mild edema in the right lung has improved. I suspect the patient had been in the right decubitus position for a long period of time. Heart size is normal and the left lung is clear.
