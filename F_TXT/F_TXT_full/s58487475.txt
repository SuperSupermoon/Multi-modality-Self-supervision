AP chest compared to ___: Since ___, relatively symmetric bilateral perihilar consolidation, most likely edema, has improved substantially in the right lung, not on the left, where there is new moderate left pleural effusion. Overall, the findings are still most suggestive of cardiac decompensation, given the persistence of mediastinal vascular and pulmonary vascular engorgement. Upright conventional views would be very helpful to determine if there is additionally left lower lobe pneumonia, but the chest CT scan on ___ suggested concurrent residual pulmonary edema and scattered bronchopneumonia in the upper lungs and possibly more severe consolidative pneumonia in the left lower lobe.
