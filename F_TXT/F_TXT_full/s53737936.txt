In comparison with the study of ___, there are lower lung volumes. Again, there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with engorgement of vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Hazy opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm represents some combination of consolidation, pleural fluid, and volume loss in the left lower lobe. The right hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen, consistent with atelectasis and small right effusion. Central catheter tip is unchanged.
