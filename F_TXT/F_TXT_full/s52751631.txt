Study is somewhat limited due to patient rotation. The heart size remains moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are grossly unchanged allowing for patient rotation. There appears to be mild pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly improved from prior. Patchy opacity in the left lung base could reflect atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen although the left extreme costophrenic angle is excluded from the field of view.
