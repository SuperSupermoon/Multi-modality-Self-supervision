In comparison to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been essential resolution of previously seen right upper lobe opacity with residual right upper lobe scarring, better seen on CT. Enlarged left axillary lymph node and multiple epicardial lymph nodes are better assessed on CT. Subtle left basilar opacity is seen which is nonspecific, could be due to atelectasis, infection, or aspiration. Cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable. The left infrahilar region is somewhat ill defined, of indeterminate chronicity. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be helpful for further and better evaluation if/when patient able.
