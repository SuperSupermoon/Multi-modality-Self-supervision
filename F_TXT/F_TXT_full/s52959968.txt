There has been interval placement of NG tube, the tip of which extends into the distal gastric antrum or proximal small bowel. The remainder of the exam is essentially unchanged from the prior examination. Redemonstrated are decreased lung volumes bilaterally, and large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. Stable cardiomegaly is noted. There is an opacity once again identified overlying the right proximal clavicle, unchanged and appearance from prior examinations. Incidentally noted is a large gallstone in the right upper quadrant.
