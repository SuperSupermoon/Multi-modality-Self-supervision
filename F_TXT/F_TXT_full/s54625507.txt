Overlying trauma board slightly limits assessment. Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 7.5 cm from the carina. An orogastric tube tip courses into the stomach, below the diaphragm, and off the inferior borders of the film. New lucency is demonstrated within the medial aspect of the right lung base, with a deep sulcus sign on the right indicative of a right-sided pneumothorax. A right-sided chest tube is demonstrated, with tip terminating in the region of the medial right lung base. Small amount subcutaneous emphysema within the right lateral chest wall is also new. Heart size appears to be moderately enlarged. Superior mediastinal widening may be due to supine positioning and poor inspiratory lung volumes. Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities are present may reflect severe pulmonary edema, but areas of hemorrhage, infection, or aspiration cannot be excluded. The left costophrenic angle is not included in the field of view. No mediastinal shift is clearly evident on this study. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
