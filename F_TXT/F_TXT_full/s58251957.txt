Right hemi thorax is uniformly opacified by a collapsed right lung and some, probably significant volume of pleural effusion. Poor definition of the right main bronchus and reflects retained secretions or other endobronchial occlusion. Left lung clear. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC. No left pleural effusion or pneumothorax
