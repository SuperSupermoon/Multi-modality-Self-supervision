AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. Given lack of prior studies for comparison, evaluation is quite limited. There is a hyperinflated right lung suggesting underlying emphysema. Trace right pleural effusion and right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis. There is a double density obscuring the left mid and lower lung which could represent left pleural effusion, basilar consolidation, likely also a component of atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Heart size cannot be assessed. Also, mediastinal contour is impossible to assess given the adjacent opacity in the left hemithorax. The bony structures appear grossly intact.
