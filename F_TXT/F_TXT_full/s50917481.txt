As compared to prior chest radiograph from earlier this morning, there is no significant change. No pneumothorax identified. Moderate sized left-sided pleural effusion is unchanged. Platelike atelectasis is again seen in the left upper lobe. Known left perihilar mass and associated atelectasis is better assessed on prior CT examination.
