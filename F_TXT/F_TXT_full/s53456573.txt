The cardiac contours are difficult to assess because of moderate elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, but the heart is probably enlarged, at least to a mild degree. Pleural effusions and left basilar opacities in the lungs are also difficult to exclude because of hemidiaphragmatic elevation. However, new reticulation in the right mid lobe suggests mild fluid overload.
