Frontal chest radiograph. Supine positioning accentuates moderate cardiomegaly as well as vascular congestion which with mediastinal venous dilatation is more pronounced over three hours probably due to volume administration. Small right and moderate left pleural effusions have increased, but there is no pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities consistent with effusions and atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Rib fractures better seen on concurrent CT.
