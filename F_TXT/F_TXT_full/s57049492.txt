CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 7:56 a.m. and allowing for differences in technique, there is some increased density and ill definition of the left base, suggesting a small effusion and left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Again seen are prominent bilateral hila and right paratracheal soft tissues. There is upper zone redistribution, slightly more pronounced than on the earlier film.
