An orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, the tip projects over the gastric body. Lung volumes are decreased, accentuating the cardiac silhouette. The left costophrenic angle is not clearly visualized, could be secondary to a pleural effusion, atelectasis or could be due to patient's positioning and overlying soft tissues. The right costophrenic angle is not included in this examination. The upper lung fields are clear. No definite focal consolidation identified on this single portable radiograph.
