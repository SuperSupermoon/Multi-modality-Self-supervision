AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination with patient in semi-erect position. The latest examination interval was two days. Position of previously described wide caliber dialysis catheter is unchanged. The patient remains intubated, the ETT still terminating in the trachea some 4 cm above the level of the carina. Mild cardiac enlargement as before. No evidence of pneumothorax. Changes observed in the pulmonary vasculature suggest slightly less congestive pattern as perivascular haze is less prominent. No new infiltrates. Small amount of pleural effusion on left base, blunting the lateral pleural sinus as before. A Dobbhoff line is identified, seen to reach well into the stomach.
