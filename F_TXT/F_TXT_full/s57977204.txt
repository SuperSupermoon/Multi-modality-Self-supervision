An endotracheal tube is in standard expected position. There has been interval placement of a nasoenteric catheter with the tip in the stomach, projecting over the left upper quadrant. Moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged compared to recent prior examination from 20 minutes prior. A linear density along the left diaphragmatic contour is stable since most recent prior, but new from the initial trauma radiograph from one day prior, likely something overlying the patient. There has been no other significant change since recent exam.
