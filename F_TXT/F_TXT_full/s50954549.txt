The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is increased opacification at the right lung base compared to the prior study, which likely represents a combination of increased atelectasis and a small pleural effusion. The left lung is unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. An enteric tube is again seen with tip in unchanged position.
