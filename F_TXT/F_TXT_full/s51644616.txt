In comparison with the earlier study of this date, with the chest tube on water seal, there is little change in the appearance of the apical pneumothorax. Remainder of the study shows some increasing opacification at the right base consistent with pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis. This could in part be related to positional change of the patient.
