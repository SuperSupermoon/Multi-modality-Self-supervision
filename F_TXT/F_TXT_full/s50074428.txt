Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 7 cm from the carina an should be advanced to to 3 cm for more secure seating. There has been little change over the past several days. Extensive left pleural abnormality, probably largely fluid is unchanged. This is responsible for considerable atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette is stable, but mild pulmonary edema has increased since ___. A 2 cm wide round peripheral lesion in the right midlung has characteristics suggesting pulmonary infarction, but the chest CTA on ___ showing that lesion did not show a concurrent pulmonary embolus. Small right pleural effusion is stable. Right jugular line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction and an esophageal drainage tube passes into the stomach, but the tip is partially obscured by contrast agent. It should probably be advanced. There is no pneumothorax.
