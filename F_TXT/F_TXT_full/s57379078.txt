In comparison to the study of ___, the right-sided effusion appears to have resolved. The right lung is essentially clear now. However, there is still near-complete opacification of the left hemithorax due to the substantial loculated pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. No evidence of pneumonia within regions of well-ventilated right lung. A pigtail catheter is noted at the left lung base, unchanged in position. The left PICC line has changed in position and now crosses over to the right brachiocephalic vein, possibly entering right internal jugular vein.
