Compared to the prior film, the tip of the aortic balloon pump appears to lie higher. Though the aortic knob is not well delineated, it appears to lie at the top of the expected location of the aortic knob. ET tube tip approximately 3.9 cm above the carina. NG tube, beneath the diaphragm, with tip overlying fundus. Catheter from an inferior approach, question Swan-Ganz catheter, with tip overlying the region of the main pulmonary artery. Compared to the prior study, there may have been slight leftward shift of the mediastinum. Again seen are diffuse patchy opacities throughout both lungs, most pronounced in the upper zones, with relative sparing of the lower zones. Density of the left upper zone is more confluent than on the prior study. There are not fully characterized, but could represent an atypical distribution of CHF with pulmonary edema or other alveolar infiltrates.
