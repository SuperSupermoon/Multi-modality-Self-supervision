1. Patient is markedly rotated to the right which limits evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours, but they are likely essentially unchanged. There is persistent mild pulmonary edema in the setting of low lung volumes, which appears to be worsening when compared to the previous study. A diffuse pneumonia would be less likely. Small layering effusions likely unchanged. No pneumothorax. Linear opacity at the right lung base likely reflect subsegmental atelectasis. 2. Left internal jugular central line with its tip in the superior vena cava. Endotracheal tube has its tip 4.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
