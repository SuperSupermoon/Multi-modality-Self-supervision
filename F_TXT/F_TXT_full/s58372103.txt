The heart is mildly enlarged, slightly larger than on the prior study. There is pulmonary vascular redistribution and perihilar haze with small areas of alveolar infiltrate compatible with fluid overload. There is dense retrocardiac opacity consistent with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. The overall impression is that of worsening CHF. Dual-lead pacemaker is again seen, unchanged. Mediastinal clips and wires are again visualized.
