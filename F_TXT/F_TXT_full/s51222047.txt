Frontal view of the chest was obtained. The heart is mildly enlarged, similar to prior. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Left pleural effusion is similar to prior. Bibasilar opacities likely represent collapse of both lower lobes. Consolidation of left upper lobe is unchanged. Right subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the lower SVC. Tracheostomy tube, OG tube, and wires of the left chest wall pacer are in stable position.
