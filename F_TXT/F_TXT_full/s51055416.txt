As compared to previous study of 1 day earlier, bilateral pleural catheters remain in place, with a newly appreciated very small biapical pneumothoraces. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Bibasilar areas of atelectasis are again demonstrated, similar on the right but improved on the left. Left pleural effusion has nearly resolved in the interval, and a small to moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged.
