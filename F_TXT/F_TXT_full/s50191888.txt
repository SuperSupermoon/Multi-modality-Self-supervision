Heart is mildly enlarged and calcifications are seen in the aortic arch as before. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. There is a small round patchy area of opacity projecting over the right base. In the appropriate clinical context, this could represent a developing pneumonia. Bibasilar atelectasis again noted. No significant pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
