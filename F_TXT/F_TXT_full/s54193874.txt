Lung volumes are low. Allowing for this factor, heart size and pulmonary vascularity are normal. With the exception of crowding of bronchovascular structures at the lung bases, lungs as well as pleural surfaces are grossly clear. If clinical suspicion for acute pulmonary process persists, repeat radiograph with improved inspiratory level may be helpful for more full assessment of the lung bases.
