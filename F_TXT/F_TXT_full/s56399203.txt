AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding similar portable examination of ___. The previously existing small caliber pigtail catheter draining the left pleural base has been exchanged with a large caliber chest tube now seen to terminate in the left apical area. The amount of pleural effusion has decreased. There exist now a loculated pneumothorax on the left base at the site of the tube entrance but otherwise the lung remains aerated with no extension of the pneumothorax in the apical area. The previously described left-sided PICC line remains in unchanged position.
