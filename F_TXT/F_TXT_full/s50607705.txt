1. Right internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are unchanged. Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours in this post-operative patient status post median sternotomy with aortic valve replacement. There is persistent but improving mild pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac consolidation persists, and there is likely an associated layering effusion. These findings most likely reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although aspiration or pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
