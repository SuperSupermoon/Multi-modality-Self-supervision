Patient is status post median sternotomy and prosthetic cardiac valve replacement with mild cardiomegaly noted. The aorta is mildly tortuous with atherosclerotic calcifications seen at the aortic knob. Hilar contours are unremarkable. There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution, likely due to supine positioning, without overt pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation, large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected on this supine exam. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
