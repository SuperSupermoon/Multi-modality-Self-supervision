Back board hardware projects over the midline. Tracheostomy appears to be in standard position. Left PICC tip appears to have been advanced with tip now in the low SVC; this could also reflect patient arm positioning. Left pleural effusion is unchanged. Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis is seen. Subtle increased opacity in the right apex may represent a small amount of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is detected. Bilateral rib fractures are again noted.
