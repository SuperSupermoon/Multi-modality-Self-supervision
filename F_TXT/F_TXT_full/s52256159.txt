Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates unchanged position of right subclavian approach central venous catheter and apparently abandoned left approach central line tubing. The heart is top normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits allowing for rotation. Dense consolidation in the left upper lobe is progressively more dense as compared to prior exams, most compatible with pneumonia. A slightly less dense consolidation is likely present in the right lower lobe. Underlying lesion in the left upper lung cannot be assessed. Streaky bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis is present. There is a similar to slightly increased degree of central pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
