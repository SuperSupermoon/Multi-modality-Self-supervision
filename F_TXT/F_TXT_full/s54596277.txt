Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular distension appears similar. Interval resolution of left basilar opacities and partial clearing of right mid and lower lung opacities. The latter most likely represent resolving atelectasis, but coexisting infectious consolidation in the right lower lobe is also possible. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged.
