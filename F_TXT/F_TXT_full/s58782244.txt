Compared with the radiograph from earlier on the same date, the left pigtail catheter has been removed and a left chest tube is now in place. There is a persistent large amount of left pleural fluid, with an irregular contour of the left chest wall, possibly suggesting loculation. Small right effusion unchanged. The other monitoring and support devices are unchanged in the interval.
