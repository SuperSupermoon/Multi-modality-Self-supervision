Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained. Patient has a tracheostomy tube which appears grossly unchanged. NG tube courses into the left upper abdomen. A right arm PICC line is seen, tip extending into the lower SVC/right atrium. As seen previously, there is extensive opacity in the right lung concerning for pneumonia, though a component of loculated effusion is also suggested. There is likely superimposed pulmonary edema. No large left effusion. No pneumothorax. Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess.
