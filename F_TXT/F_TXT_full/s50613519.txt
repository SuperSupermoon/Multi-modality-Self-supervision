Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Mild pulmonary edema has improved. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Small left effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Bibasilar increased opacities greater on the left side are the combination of atelectasis, effusions, and the pulmonary edema. There is no evident pneumothorax.
