The patient is status post left-sided dual-chamber pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. The cardiac silhouette size appears moderately enlarged with a left ventricular predominance. The aortic knob is calcified. There are low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular markings, and result in mild apparent widening of the superior mediastinum. Fibrotic changes appear to be present and are most pronounced along the periphery and lung bases bilaterally, with coarse interstitial markings. There appears to be blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally, which could represent chronic pleural thickening, though small effusions can not be excluded. There is no overt pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. More focal opacity in the left lung base is present, and an underlying infectious process cannot be completely excluded. Leftward deviation of the superior trachea above the thoracic inlet is noted and may be due to tortuous vessels.
