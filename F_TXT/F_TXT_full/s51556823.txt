As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have decreased. The preexisting moderate pulmonary edema is therefore visually more obvious than on the previous image. Moreover, the size of the cardiac silhouette is increased as compared to the previous examination. The simultaneous presence of parenchymal opacities reflecting pneumonia cannot be excluded. There are no larger pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
