Single portable upright AP image of the chest. There are low lung volumes. There is an interval increase in the alveolar opacities bilaterally, consistent with moderate to severe new onset pulmonary edema. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears to be somewhat enlarged from prior exam, particularly in the right mediastinum. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. A pacer is seen overlying the left anterior chest with intact leads in appropriate position.
