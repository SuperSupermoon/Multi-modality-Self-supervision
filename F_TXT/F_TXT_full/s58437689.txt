As compared to the previous radiograph, the pleural gap has decreased in diameter, a pleural surface line at the left lung base is barely visible. The mediastinum has returned to its normal position. However, there is still minimal diaphragmatic depression, so that the suction on the left chest tube should probably remain in place. Unchanged evidence of a pneumomediastinum. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged massive air collection in the soft tissues. Unchanged appearance of the right lung.
