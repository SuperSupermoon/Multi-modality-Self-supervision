AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination with patient in upright position dated ___. On this supine positioned patient, diaphragms are relatively high positioned obscuring partially the cardiac silhouettes. There is still no evidence of cardiac enlargement and no pulmonary congestive pattern is identified. No acute parenchymal infiltrates are seen and no pneumothorax can be identified in the apical area.The pleural sinuses remain free.
