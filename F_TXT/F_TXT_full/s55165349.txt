In comparison with the study of ___, there appears to be increased prominence of indistinct pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. However, this is somewhat difficult to assess due to the extensive scattered radiation related to the size of the patient. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with blunting of the left and possibly right costophrenic angles. Marked displacement of the lower cervical trachea to the left is again seen, related to a thyroid mass. Central catheter remains about the level of the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and the superior vena cava.
