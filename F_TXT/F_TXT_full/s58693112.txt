Interval removal of lines and tubes, except for residual left internal jugular catheter unchanged in position. No definite pneumothorax, but there is likely mild pneumomediastinum manifested by a curvilinear lucency surrounding the cardiomediastinal contours. Marked worsening of left retrocardiac opacity likely due to atelectasis, and slight worsening of right basilar atelectasis. Bilateral small pleural effusions are present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
