In comparison with the study of ___, there is left apical pleural thickening with scattered calcifications in the apical region, all consistent with old granulomatous disease. Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion. There is mild asymmetry of opacification at the bases, more prominent on the right. Although this could represent a normal finding, in view of the clinical history the possibility of a developing right lower lung consolidation could be considered.
