1. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip just below the esophageal gastric junction. Advancement of the tube by approximately 5 cm would be recommended to ensure that the side port is subdiaphragmatic. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. Lung volumes remain low with improved aeration at the right base but interval appearance of retrocardiac opacity suggestive of atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. Possible layering left effusion. No evidence of pulmonary edema although the vasculature is crowded. No pneumothorax. Results were communicated to the patient's nurse, ___, by phone on ___ at 11:38 a.m. at the time of discovery.
