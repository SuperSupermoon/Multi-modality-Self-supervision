The NG and ET tubes have been removed. There is marked interval increase in size of the left-sided pleural effusion. Difficult to comment on the interval change of the left lung airspace consolidation, as the vague airspace opacification projecting over the left upper and mid lung zones may be secondary to pleural fluid or airspace consolidation. Mild mediastinal shift to the right. The major airways are patent. No pneumothorax. Small to moderate right-sided effusion unchanged. The right upper lung zone is clear. Evidence of previous cholecystectomy.
