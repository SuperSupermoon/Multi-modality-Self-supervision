An endotracheal tube has been placed since the prior examination, which terminates 3 cm above the carina. An orogastric tube courses towards the stomach. Its tip not visualized. The sidehole, however, appears to lie slightly above the left hemidiaphragm. Superimposed on background elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, there is persistent opacification at the right lung base with right infrahilar opacification and suspected pleural effusion. Aeration is much better in the left lower lung, however, which appears better expanded with reduction in opacification. There is no pneumothorax. Mild congestion appears similar to slightly decreased with enlarged indistinct vessels.
