A single portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a left pectoral cardiac device with multiple leads in place. A right abandoned lead is noted. The inspiratory lung volumes are low. Retrocardiac opacification may reflect a combination of pleural effusion with associated atelectasis but underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. The right lung shows no pleural effusion or focal consolidation. No pneumothorax is detected. The cardiac silhouette is massively enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are incompletely assessed in the setting of low lung volumes and massive cardiomegaly. There is calcification at the aortic knob.
