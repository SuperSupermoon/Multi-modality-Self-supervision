Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the morning. Right hydropneumothorax is probably unchanged, allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. Right lower lobe atelectasis has increased. Cardiomegaly is stable. Left lower lobe opacities have improved consistent with improving atelectasis. ET tube is in the standard position. NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right IJ catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
