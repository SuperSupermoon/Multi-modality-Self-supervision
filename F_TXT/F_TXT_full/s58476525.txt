Evaluation is slightly limited due to patient rotation and low inspiratory lung volumes. The cardiac silhouette size is top normal. Mild widening of the mediastinum is stable and likely related to vessel engorgement. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema is unchanged. Bibasilar opacities on the left greater than the right are slightly improved from the most recent prior study, possibly reflecting atelectasis. A small left pleural effusion cannot be entirely excluded. No significant right pleural effusion is detected. An endotracheal tube is in standard position. A right PICC line is unchanged with the tip terminating in the mid-to-low SVC. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this image.
