This patient is known for a chronic interstitial lung disease as shown in the previous CT scan. However, there are additional interstitial opacities that suggest a superimposed moderate pulmonary interstitial edema. The cardiac contour is mildly enlarged. There is no pleural effusion. The right jugular catheter is in adequate position.
