Lung volumes are low. Heart size is at least moderately enlarged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is noted, worse in the interval. Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present with bibasilar airspace opacities, most likely reflective of atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. Percutaneous catheter is noted with pigtail in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Left PICC tip now appears to be flipped, likely within the azygos.
