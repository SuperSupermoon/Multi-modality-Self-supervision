As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has been removed and the patient has received a tracheostomy tube. 1 of the 2 nasogastric tubes has also been removed. Finally the right internal jugular vein catheter has been removed. The remaining left subclavian catheter remains in place. The lung volumes remain low and the extent and severity of the known left apical and right basal parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting pneumonia, are unchanged. Mild cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema. No pleural effusions.
