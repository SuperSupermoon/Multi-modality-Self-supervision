AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar study obtained seven hours earlier during the same day. During the interval, one of the left-sided basal chest tubes has been removed. The second lower position tube remains. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the left hemithorax after tube removal and no new pulmonary abnormalities are seen. No mediastinal shift can be identified.
