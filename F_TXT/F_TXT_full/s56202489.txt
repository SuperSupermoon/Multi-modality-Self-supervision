The lungs are hyperexpanded. There are diffuse interstitial abnormalities and mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly likely reflecting some component of interstitial pulmonary edema. Opacities at the lung bases likely reflect a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. The aortic arch is calcified. There is no pneumothorax.
