A large-bore right-sided central venous catheter tip sits in the mid SVC. Sternotomy wires are unchanged. Mediastinal contours are unchanged and the heart size is likely large but masked by bilateral large pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, similar in extent to the prior exam from earlier this morning. The prosthetic valve is minimally perceptible. Clips are present in the left axilla. There is no pneumothorax. The degree of pulmonary edema within the lungs is unchanged.
