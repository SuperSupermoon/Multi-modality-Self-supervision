AP chest compared to ___: Moderate right pleural effusion has increased, making difficult to determine in the semierect patient whether there has also been an increase in generalized pulmonary edema, although I think there has been. Whether this is worsening diffuse alveolar damage or an overlay of pulmonary edema is difficult to say, but because mediastinal veins are also larger, I suspect it is volume or cardiac related. The extent of moderate cardiomegaly has also increased slightly. There is no pneumothorax. ET tube is in standard placement and an upper enteric drainage tube passes into minimally dilated stomach and out of view. I see no central vascular lines in the field-of-view.
