Left-sided pacemaker type device again seen with single lead overlying the right ventricle. No obvious pneumothorax is identified. Compared with the prior film, opacity at both bases is increased. This appears to reflect the presence of small bilateral effusions, with associated collapse and/or consolidation. Some of the lateral left mid zone patchy opacity appears improved. Otherwise, the overall appearance is similar prior. There is background hyperinflation, consistent with COPD. Upper zone redistribution noted. As before, there are background interstitial opacities in both lungs, which could be due to chronic lung disease or asymmetric pulmonary edema. However, a possible infectious etiology cannot be excluded.
