Overall, two right-sided chest tubes are similar in position compared to the prior exam. Small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. There has been slight interval improvement in the extent of the right subcutaneous emphysema. Large known upper lobe consolidation on the right appears similar to the prior exam with an interval increase in right lung base atelectasis. The left lung is clear aside from plate-like areas of atelectasis at the left lung base. There is no interval change in the appearance of the cardiac silhouette. There may be a small right-sided pleural effusion.
