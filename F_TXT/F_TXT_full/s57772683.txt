There are low lung volumes. This accentuates the size of the cardiac silhouette which is top normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but no overt pulmonary edema is present. Hazy and patchy opacities in the retrocardiac region and right lung base may reflect areas of atelectasis though aspiration or infection cannot be excluded. There are probable trace bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. There are no acute osseous abnormalities seen.
