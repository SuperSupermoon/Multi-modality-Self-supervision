AP chest compared to ___: Severe consolidation has not cleared from the left lower lobe, presumably the site of pneumonia. Milder peribronchial opacification in the right lower lobe should be followed. Pulmonary vascular congestion more pronounced accompanied by enlargement of the azygos vein suggests volume overload or incipient cardiac decompensation, even though heart size is normal. ET tube in standard placement, upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper portion of a non-distended stomach, and a left PIC line tip projects over the upper SVC. No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
