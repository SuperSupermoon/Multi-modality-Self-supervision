A left-sided chest wall pacer is noted with leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle, unchanged in their position. The cardiac size is difficult to approximate, but appears persistently enlarged. Interval increase in the degree of now moderate to severe pulmonary edema. Streaky bibasilar opacities likely reflect atelectasis, although superimposed infection is difficult to exclude. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions are noted, increased bilaterally from the prior examination.
