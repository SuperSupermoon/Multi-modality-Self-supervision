Since the prior radiograph on ___, acquired few hours apart, moderate-sized right apical pneumothorax has minimally decreased. The right midlung opacity has resolved, suggesting it was atelectasis. Mediastinal shift to the right side still persists, but has minimally improved. Mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion and left basal atelectasis is unchanged. Two chest tubes, one ending at the right lung apex, whereas another at the right lung base, are unchanged in position, whereas the third chest tube seen on the previous chest radiographs has been removed.
