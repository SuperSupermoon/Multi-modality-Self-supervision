Heart size remains moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged with mild atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is clearly identified. Multilevel degenerative changes are again seen within the thoracic spine.
