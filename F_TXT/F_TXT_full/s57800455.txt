In comparison with the study of ___, there are substantially lower lung volumes that accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. There is increased opacification at the right base that could reflect either atelectatic changes or superimposed aspiration. The left hemidiaphragm is not well seen, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small pleural effusion. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle could reflect pleural fluid on that side. If the condition of the patient permits, a lateral view could be helpful.
