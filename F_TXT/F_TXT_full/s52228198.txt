There has been placement of a right-sided central venous catheter with the distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. There are low lung volumes. There are diffuse airspace opacities and prominence of the parenchymal markings suggestive of pulmonary edema. Superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. There is normal osseous mineralization.
