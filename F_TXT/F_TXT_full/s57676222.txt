Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The patient's overlying chin obscures the medial bilateral upper lobes. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. Prominence of the pulmonary arteries is partially imaged and again seen. Evidence of diaphragmatic/pleural plaques is seen bilaterally suggesting prior asbestos exposure.
