AP chest compared to ___: Even with difference in radiographic positioning, there has probably been a modest increase in diameter of the cardiac silhouette, now mildly enlarged, that could be due to mild cardiomegaly or development of pericardial effusion. Increased caliber of the azygos vein suggests increased central venous pressure or volume. Pulmonary vasculature is also mildly engorged, but there is no edema or focal abnormality to suggest pneumonia. Pleural effusions are small if any. Dialysis catheter ends in the right atrium. A shunt catheter traverses the right neck, chest and passes out of view in the abdomen. Rightward deviation of the trachea is due to dilated head and neck vessels or a mass in or around the left lobe of the thyroid gland. Clinical correlation is needed.
