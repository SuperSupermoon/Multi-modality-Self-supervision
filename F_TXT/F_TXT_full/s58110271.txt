Left chest wall pacemaker generator with dual chamber leads. The right atrial lead projects over the midline and the presumed ventricular lead terminates over the central mediastinum rather than near the cardiac apex as is usually seen. Heart size is mildly enlarged. Represent redistribution and central pulmonary vascular congestion is noted. Mild interstitial edema is seen. No large pleural effusion. Small right pleural effusion is likely. No pneumothorax.
