In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a left mainstem bronchus shunt with substantial Re aeration of the left hemithorax. Persistent opacification at the left base most likely represents atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude. There are mild atelectatic changes at the right base. The pulmonary vessels are indistinct and mildly engorged, consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
