Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day early in the morning. There is no significant interval change. There is no evident large pneumothorax, but as before, differentiation of pneumothorax from known large apical bullae is difficult. There are no new lung abnormalities. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged. The tracheostomy tube is in standard position. Left PICC tip is in the lower SVC.
