Combination of widespread interstitial pulmonary abnormality and interstitial emphysema is unchanged for the past several days. Pneumothorax is minimal if any, bilateral pleural drainage tubes are still in place. Severe subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall and neck and large scale pneumomediastinum are not appreciably changed. ET tube, right jugular central venous infusion catheter and esophageal drainage tube are in standard placements respectively.
