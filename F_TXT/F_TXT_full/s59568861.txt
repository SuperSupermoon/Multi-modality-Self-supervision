Focal opacity in the right lower lobe is partially due to known lung cancer but may also have some component of hemorrhage from the recent biopsy. Apparent rightward deviation of the trachea may partially be due to patient positioning. A thin curvilinear pleural line is seen in the right apex, but unlikely to be pneumothorax as lung markings are seen beyond it. The left lung is clear. The heart size is normal.
