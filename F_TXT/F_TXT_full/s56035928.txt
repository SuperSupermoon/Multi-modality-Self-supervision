Comparison is made to prior study from ___. There is a large hiatal hernia which is now filled mostly with fluid. This limits evaluation. There has been development of bilateral pleural effusions since the previous study. Some coarsening of the bronchovascular markings. Atelectasis or consolidation to left retrocardiac area cannot be excluded due to the hiatal hernia. There is some generalized demineralization.
