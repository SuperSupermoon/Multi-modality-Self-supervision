A tracheostomy catheter appears in standard unchanged position. A catheter overlying the right mid clavicular line appears similar to prior examination, possibly a VP shunt. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged from prior. Linear bibasilar opacities are unchanged and likely reflect atelectasis. No confluent consolidation is identified. A significant widening of the right paratracheal stripe corresponds with a known large thyroid goiter, better characterized on prior chest CT. Leftward tracheal deviation appears stable. The remainder of the mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits for age. The heart size is borderline or slightly enlarged. There is pneumothorax.
