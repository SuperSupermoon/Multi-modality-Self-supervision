Portable single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with patient in upright position. A left PICC line terminates in the lower SVC. There is now an increased right upper lobe opacity in addition to the bilateral, right greater than left, opacities previously seen. This radiograph underestimates the extent of the moderate bilateral pleural effusions which are better assessed on the CT scan from today. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
