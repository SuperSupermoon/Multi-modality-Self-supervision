The enteric tube courses below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view within the stomach. An external cardiac defibrillator is partially imaged, unchanged. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is notable for moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged.
