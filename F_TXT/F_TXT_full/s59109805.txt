An AP view of the chest is submitted showing chain sutures in the right mid lung field and adjacent spiculated density corresponding to postoperative changes seen on CT from earlier today. A single surgical clip or fiducial marker is identified just inferior to this which is seen posteriorly on the CT. No pneumothorax is seen on this single view which appears to be an upright expiratory film. Chest port with intact tubing is seen over the right upper lung zone. The heart and mediastinal contours appear unchanged. There is gaseous distention of the stomach beneath the left hemidiaphragm which is slightly elevated on this image.
