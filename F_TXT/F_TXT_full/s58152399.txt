AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination obtained eight hours earlier during the same day. The previously identified right internal jugular central venous line remains in unchanged position. The patient remains intubated, the ET terminating in the trachea 5 cm above the level of the carina. During the interval, a right-sided thoracocentesis has been performed and the right-sided basal hazy density has markedly improved and the right lung base is now free with clear delineation of the diaphragmatic contour and absence of fluid accumulation in the right lateral pleural sinus. The left-sided basal density and partial obscuration of the diaphragm remains rather unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax on either side.
