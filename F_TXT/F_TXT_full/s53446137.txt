Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates very low lung volumes, which results in bronchovascular crowding. The low lung volumes likely accentuate the size the heart and mediastinum, which remain enlarged. Aorta is very tortuous. No pneumothorax. The nasogastric tube is coiled in the esophagus, and a portion of the coiled tube demonstrates an acute angle, which is concerning for potential damage to the tube.
