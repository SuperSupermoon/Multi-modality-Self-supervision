Upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval placement of a pigtail pleural catheter in the left hemithorax, with associated reexpansion of the left lung. A small basilar pneumothorax remains, improved since the prior study. No other significant change is noted compared to the prior study from two hours ago.
