As compared to the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, the patient is markedly rotated towards the right, limiting assessment of cardiomediastinal contours. Asymmetrical opacification in the left hemi thorax could be related to the effect of rotation and overlying breast tissue, but repeat, nonrotated radiograph would be helpful to exclude an acute parenchymal and/or pleural process. Exam is otherwise unchanged.
