Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Right lung and pleural surfaces are clear. On the left, a small pleural effusion has decreased in size since ___.

Although potentially due to atelectasis adjacent to the effusion, infectious pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Within the imaged upper abdomen, diffuse haziness is consistent with history of ascites.
