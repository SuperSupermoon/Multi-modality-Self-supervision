1. Status post placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter terminating at the proximal SVC/brachiocephalic-SVC junction without evidence of pneumothorax. Persistent low lung volumes. Perihilar opacities raising concern for worsening pulmonary edema, somewhat similar compared to the study from 16:05 but appear worse as compared to the study from 17:42 today. 2. Bilateral pleural effusions. Left base retrocardiac opacity may be due to combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion; however, underlying consolidation is not excluded.
