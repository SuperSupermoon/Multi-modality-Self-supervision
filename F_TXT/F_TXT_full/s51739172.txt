Extremely low lung volumes are again noted with crowding of the bronchovascular markings. There are persistent bibasilar opacities which could represent any combination of atelectasis and effusion with possible superimposed infection. Superiorly the lungs are clear of consolidation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged. No acute osseous abnormalities.
