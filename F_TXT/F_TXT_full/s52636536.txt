Cardiac silhouette size appears mild to moderately enlarged. The aorta is calcified. Prominence of the left hilar region could suggest underlying lymphadenopathy. Relatively symmetric diffuse hazy opacities are noted within both lungs, findings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema, though an atypical infection cannot be completely excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Surgical anchor projects over the right humeral head. Mild dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is noted.
