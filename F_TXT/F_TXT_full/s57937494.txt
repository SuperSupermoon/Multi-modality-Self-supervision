Large right pleural effusion has continued to grow, collapsing right middle and lower lobes. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess although is likely enlarged. Vascular engorgement in the left is exaggerated by expected redirection of blood flow from the right. There is no pneumothorax. Biapical scarring is unchanged. Left lung is otherwise clear.
