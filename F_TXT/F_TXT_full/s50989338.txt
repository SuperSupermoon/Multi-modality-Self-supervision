AP chest compared to ___ through ___: There is no appreciable pneumothorax, and right pleural effusion is minimal, in the fissure, following right lung surgery. Basal pleural tube in place. In addition to bibasilar atelectasis, there is a new roughly 35 mm wide round opacity projecting to the right of the spine just above the hemidiaphragm. This could be an artifact rather than a genuine finding, but if real, it is probably a hematoma in the right lower lobe. Opacification at the left lung base is atelectasis alone. Upper lungs are clear. Heart size is normal. ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach and would need to be advanced 10 cm to move all the side ports beyond the gastroesophageal junction. Review of the patient's recent CT scans, ___ and ___ shows rapid progression and equally rapid involution of multifocal areas of alveolar opacification and frank consolidation. Presuming the patient was not treated with high-dose steroids between ___ and ___, the pattern is one of reaction to exogenous substances, prescribed or otherwise.
