In the distally at another chest tube than in comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a right pigtail catheter that has drained a substantial amount of the pleural fluid. Left pigtail catheter is unchanged. No evidence of pneumothorax. Bibasilar opacification is again consistent with some pleural fluid and atelectasis.
