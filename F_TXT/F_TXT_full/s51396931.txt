Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained on ___. The ET tube tip is impinging the left tracheal wall and should be repositioned, currently 4.5 cm above the carina. Additional substantial progression of left lower lung consolidation is noted as well as of the right lower lobe. No frank edema is seen, although mild degree of congestion cannot be excluded. Left pleural effusion is most likely present. No pneumothorax is seen.
