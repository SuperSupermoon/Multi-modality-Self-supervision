AP portable upright view of the chest. Overlying EKG leads are present somewhat limiting the evaluation. An area of scarring is again noted in the right upper lung, not significantly changed. Also noted is scarring in the right left and right lower lungs. Opacity in the left lower lung is slightly increased which raises potential concern for a superimposed pneumonia. No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous structures are intact.
