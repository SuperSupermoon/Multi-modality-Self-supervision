An ET tube is present. The tip lies at the level of mid clavicular heads, 3.7 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, the tip overlies the upper stomach. Right IJ central line tip overlies the right atrium. No pneumothorax is detected. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged. Diffuse patchy opacities in both lungs, most pronounced in the left mid and right lower zones, together with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, are grossly similar to the prior study. No new area of focal consolidation is identified. No gross effusion. Small bilateral effusions would be difficult to exclude. No pneumothorax detected.
