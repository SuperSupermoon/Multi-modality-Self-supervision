The tip of the Dobbhoff tube extends to about the level of the ligament of Treitz. Endotracheal tube has been removed and the right IJ catheter extends to the lower SVC or upper right atrium. There is some increased opacification in both lower zones. Some of this reflects volume loss in the left lower lobe with probable vascular congestion. In the appropriate clinical setting, possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be seriously considered.
