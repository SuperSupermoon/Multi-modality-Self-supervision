There are bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the left than the right. No pneumothorax seen. No evidence of a pneumomediastinum however the small volume of air seen on the prior CT chest is unlikely to be visible on chest radiographs. Pacemaker wires are unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study.
