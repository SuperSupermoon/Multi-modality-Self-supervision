Status post right thoracic surgery, most likely lobectomy, recording rib defects and clips in situ. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The cardiac silhouette is of normal size. The left hemithorax is normal. At the site of resection on the right, there is no evidence of recurrence. However, CT should be performed given the substantially higher sensitivity of this technique.
