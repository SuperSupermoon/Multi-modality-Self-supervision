CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Compared with ___ at 8:48 a.m. and allowing for differences in technique, I doubt significant interval change. Again seen is cardiomegaly, with increased retrocardiac density, and a small left effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. There may also be a small layering right effusion, with hazy opacity at the right base. There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora. Left IJ central line overlies mid SVC.
