There is increased retrocardiac opacity; however, this may be technical or external in nature given the configuration and its inferior extension to a level below the expected lower margin of the lung into the upper abdomen. Elsewhere, the lungs are clear. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but stable in configuration given differences in technique. Hypertrophic changes are noted in the spine.
