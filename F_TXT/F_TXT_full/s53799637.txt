No definite focal consolidation is seen. Relative increase in opacity projecting over the left lung base as compared to the right is felt to be due to overlying soft tissue rather than actual consolidation. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
