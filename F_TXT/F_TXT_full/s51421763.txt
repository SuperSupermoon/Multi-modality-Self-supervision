There are least four contiguous displaced right-sided rib fractures. There is no right pneumothorax or intrathoracic bleeding. A small left pleural effusion may be present. Bibasilar atelectasis is mild, but the upper lungs are grossly clear. The aorta is heavily calcified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise within normal limits.
