Small right pleural effusion has improved since yesterday. In addition, newly developed right lower lung opacity on ___ has almost completely resolved and was either atelectasis or aspiration. No new discrete lung opacities of concern. Pleural effusion if any is small on the left side. Top normal heart size is unchanged, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is no demonstrable pneumothorax. The study is not designed for assessment of bones; however, within the limitation, there is displaced posterior ninth and tenth rib fracture which was appreciated in the prior radiographs as well. The tip of the epidural catheter ends at the mid thorax.
