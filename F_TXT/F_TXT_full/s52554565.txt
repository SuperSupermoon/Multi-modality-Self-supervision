A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube terminating 2.5 cm from the carina. The enteric tube terminates within the stomach, but the side port is in the distal esophagus. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
