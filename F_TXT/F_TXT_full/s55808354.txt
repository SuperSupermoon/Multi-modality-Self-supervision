In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes. There has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 3 cm above the carina. Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base with probable small effusion. The right lung is essentially clear. The primarily fibrotic, bilateral paramediastinal opacities seen on CT are not well visualized on radiographs.
