In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued widening of the superior mediastinum. If there is any serious concern for bleeding into the mediastinum, CT should be obtained. There is some increased opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm. This is consistent with fluid in the pleural space and underlying volume loss in the left lower lobe. Right lung remains essentially clear.
