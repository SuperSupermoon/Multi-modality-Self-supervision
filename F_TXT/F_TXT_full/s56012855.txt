Endotracheal tube tip is 0.5 cm above carina, similar, should be pulled back. Stable position of vascular stent projected over right lower hilum. Subclavian central line tip at the confluence of brachiocephalic veins, stable. Enteric tube has been removed. There is residual contrast in the renal collecting system. Very shallow inspiration. Stable bilateral perihilar, basilar opacities, likely atelectasis. Trace left pleural effusion, similar. Shallow inspiration accentuates heart size, pulmonary vascularity.
