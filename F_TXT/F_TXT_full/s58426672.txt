AP chest compared to ___: Between 5:41 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. on ___, patient had right thoracotomy and two apical and a basal pleural drains were placed and there was a substantial decrease in the volume of homogenous opacity in the right upper chest, presumably hematoma. A triangular opacity at the apex of the right lung has been present since that time. If the middle lobe has not been resected, I think that is middle lobe collapse. Aeration in the right lung is therefore limited to the lower lobe which is edematous, although moderate pulmonary edema yesterday has generally improved. There is still substantial atelectasis at both lung bases medially, and there may be a small left pleural effusion. The heart is borderline enlarged, unchanged. Tip of the endotracheal tube is at least 22 mm above the carina. Upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper-to-mid portion of a non-distended stomach. There is no appreciable pneumothorax. Dr. ___ was paged at 11 o'clock when the findings were recognized.
