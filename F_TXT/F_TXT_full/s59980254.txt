Comparison is made with prior study, ___. NG tube is coiled in the esophagus. The tip is going back to the proximal esophagus. It should be repositioned. Cardiac size is top normal. The aorta is tortuous. Right subclavian catheter tip is in the lower SVC. Multiple surgical clips project in the left lung. Increasing opacity in the left lower lobe is likely a combination of atelectasis and effusion. Mild vascular congestion is stable. There is no pneumothorax. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Radiolucency projecting in the right upper quadrant/under the diaphragm is new. I doubt that this corresponds to a pneumoperitoneum. It is likely projection of the right hemidiaphragm. Please repeat radiograph, PA and lateral or decubitus lateral to exclude pneumoperitoneum. These findings were discussed with the clinical team by Dr. ___ in the afternoon of ___.
