The ET tube is slightly high-riding, ending 1-2 cm above the clavicles. The left-sided PICC line ends in the right atrium. Nasogastric tube enters the stomach, distal tip not visualized. Bilateral airspace opacities have increased. A small left layering pleural effusion has also slightly increased. Stable retrocardiac left basilar opacification may be due to atelectasis.
