As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Clips projecting over the right axilla. Substantial asymmetrical apical pleural thickening, more extensive on the right than on the left. Scarring with volume loss at the right lung bases and subsequent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Multiple calcified granulomas in the right upper lobe. All changes are constant as compared to the previous examination. In particular, there currently is no evidence for interval appearance of pneumonia. No signs of pulmonary edema.
