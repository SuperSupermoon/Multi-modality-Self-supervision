AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed. The ET tube tip is 3.5 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The left internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Minimal interstitial pulmonary edema is redemonstrated. The right mediastinal asymmetry is redemonstrated. In the absence of the prior studies available for comparison, assessment with chest CT for precise characterization of this abnormality is recommended.
