A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes with prominence of the cardiac silhouette. Again seen is a tortuous/unfolded aorta, unchanged. There is mild prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings without overt pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is identified. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
