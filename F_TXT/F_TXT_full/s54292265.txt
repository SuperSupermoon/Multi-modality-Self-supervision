As compared to the previous radiograph, the right pleural effusion has minimally decreased in extent and provides now an improved visualization of the right heart border. However, the overall extent of the effusion remains substantial. There is no evidence for the presence of a right pneumothorax. The heart remains moderately enlarged. The left lung is unremarkable.
