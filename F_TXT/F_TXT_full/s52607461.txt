AP portable upright view of the chest. Evaluation is limited due to lung volumes being low and abdominal pannus projecting over the left lung base. Allowing for this, no definite consolidation large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Please note, the left lung base is suboptimally assessed. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears stable. Patient is slightly rotated to the left. A left humeral head replacement noted. No acute bony abnormalities.
