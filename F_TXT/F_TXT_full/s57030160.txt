A right central venous access catheter terminates in the distal SVC. A new moderate-to-large right pneumothorax, with an apical and basilar component is identified. Two chest tubes enter at the base of the right lung and terminate at the apex, in adequate postion. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. Mediastinal shift is difficult to asses due to positioning. However, no significant mediastinal shift is identified. The left lung is clear. No definite pleural effusion.
