Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained. A right internal jugular central venous catheter is seen terminating in the low SVC without evidence of pneumothorax. There are prominent right greater than left perihilar opacities. No large pleural effusion is seen, although a trace right pleural effusion would be difficult to exclude. Cardiac silhouette is top normal. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
