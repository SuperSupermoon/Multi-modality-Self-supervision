The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the expected location of the stomach Patchy bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, are concerning for pneumonia or aspiration, less likely atelectasis.

Due to patient rotation, the overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are difficult to assess. Probable layering right effusion. No pneumothorax. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Persistent low lung volumes.
