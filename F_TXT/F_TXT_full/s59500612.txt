Endotracheal tube tip is at the level of the carina, approaching the right mainstem bronchus. Enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm, through the stomach, and off the inferior borders of the film. Mild cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications are seen within the aorta. Mild pulmonary edema is present with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right. Hazy opacity in the right mid lung field and right lung base could reflect atelectasis though infection is not excluded. There is no pneumothorax. Chronic deformities of the proximal humeri are re- demonstrated with absence of the humeral heads.
