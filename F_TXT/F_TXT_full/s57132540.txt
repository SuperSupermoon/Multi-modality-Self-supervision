Patient has had median sternotomy, and pleural calcification suggests either a remote pleural insult to the left hemi thorax or perhaps asbestos exposure. Recently, on ___ he was in mild pulmonary edema. There is no longer pulmonary edema. A ring shadow projecting over the left second anterior interspace could be pleural calcification or a small cavity in the lung. The 88 mm wide nodular opacity projecting over the anterior right fourth interspace could be the right nipple or a small lung nodule. I see no pneumonia or pulmonary edema currently. If this this source of coughing is not obvious, CT scanning might be reviewing. Heart size top- normal. No pleural abnormality.
