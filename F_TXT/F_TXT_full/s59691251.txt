A tracheostomy is in place. A left-sided PICC tip sits at the lower SVC. The lung volumes are low, obscuring and exaggerating the heart size; mediastinal contours are stable. There is a small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. The right costophrenic angle has been excluded from the study. There is no large pneumothorax.
