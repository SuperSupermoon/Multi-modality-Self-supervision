As compared to the recent radiograph from earlier today, the patient has been intubated, with endotracheal tube terminating 1 cm above the carinal with the neck in a flexed position. This could be withdrawn several cm for standard positioning. Exam is otherwise remarkable for worsening bibasilar opacities, persistent large left lower lobe mass, persistent left and increasing right pleural effusions. No other relevant changes since recent study of several hr earlier.
