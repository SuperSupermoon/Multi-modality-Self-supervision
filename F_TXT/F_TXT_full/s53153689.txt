An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.3 cm above the carina, at the level of the mid clavicular heads. An NG tube is present. The tip is difficult to trace beyond the lower mediastinum due to underpenetration. If clinically indicated, repeat view can be attempted at no additional charge to the patient. A dual-lumen right IJ catheter is present. Tips overlie the proximal SVC. There are low inspiratory volumes and patchy opacity at both lung bases, consistent with atelectasis and/or consolidation. There is obscuration of the left costophrenic angle, which could reflect a small left effusion. Upper zone re-distribution, but no overt CHF. Compared with supine film from ___ (today's film obtained upright), the patchy bibasilar opacities are similar, slightly worse on the left. CHF findings may be slightly improved. Differential for the bibasilar opacities includes areas of aspiration and penumonic infiltrates, as well as atelectasis.
