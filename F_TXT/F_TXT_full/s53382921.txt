CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. No previous chest radiographs on PACS record for comparison. There are low inspiratory volumes. This likely contributes to accentuation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and vascular markings. Although the vessels appear prominent and there is atelectasis at both bases, the significance of these findings is indeterminate, given the low lung volumes. No definite area of aspiration. No effusion.
