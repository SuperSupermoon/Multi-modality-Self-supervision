There is continued opacification of the left lung base with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, again consistent with pleural effusion and consolidation. Increased haziness at the right lung base may also indicate a small pleural effusion. There is no pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette appears smaller than on the most recent prior study. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There has been interval placement of a tube overlying the lower left hemithorax.
