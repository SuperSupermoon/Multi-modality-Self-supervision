In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. Tracheostomy tube, cervical fusion hardware, and left PICC line are unchanged. There is continued mild pulmonary edema with retrocardiac opacification, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and possible associated pleural effusion. The right hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen, suggesting development of pleural fluid and atelectasis at the right base as well.
