The cardiac silhouette continues to be enlarged, but without gross change. Again noted is a left-sided pacemaker type device with appropriate position of leads over the right atrium and right ventricle. There is moderate pulmonary edema, possibly slightly worse compared to the chest radiograph from 2 hours earlier. No gross effusions identified on this AP film. No pneumothoraces detected.
