AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position. The heart size is within normal limits considering AP single portable technique.No pulmonary vascular congestion is identified. No evidence of acute parenchymal infiltrates is seen on this single chest view. The lateral pleural sinus remains free of any fluid accumulation and there is no evidence of pneumothorax in the apical area. Observe that our records do not include a previous chest examination available for comparison. The patient appears rather heavy which detracts somewhat of the pulmonary image quality in general, but again no acute abnormalities are seen on this single chest view examination.
