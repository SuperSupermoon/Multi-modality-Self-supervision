CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW. Low inspiratory volumes. Prominence of cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by low lung volumes and is overall similar to a CT scan from ___. There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF. There is more patchy opacity at both bases which could represent consolidation related to CHF, though the possibility of a concurrent infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded. Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles is noted. Compared with a chest x-ray from ___, inspiratory volumes are lower, but there has been some improvement in the bilateral alveolar opacities.
