As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.7 cm above the carina. The pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities have increased in extent and severity. In addition, new bilateral pleural effusions are seen. The right PICC line remains in constant position. The patient is slightly rotated on today's examination and the pre-existing scoliosis contributes to asymmetry of the appearance of the mediastinum. Mediastinal morphology should receive close consideration on the next followup radiograph.
