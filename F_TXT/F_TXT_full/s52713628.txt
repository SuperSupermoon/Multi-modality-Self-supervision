In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube. The tip lies above the clavicles, approximately 5.7 cm above the carina. There are lower lung volumes with a mildly elevated left hemidiaphragm. Atelectatic changes at the left base are seen. The Dobbhoff tube again extends to the upper stomach, with the tube coiling on itself so the metallic tip lies just beneath the left hemidiaphragm.
