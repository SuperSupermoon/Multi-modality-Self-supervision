The patient is status post recent median sternotomy and mitral valve surgery. Indwelling support and monitoring devices are similar in position. There is no visible pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for differences in lung volumes. Small left and moderate right pleural effusion are again demonstrated with interval improvement and adjacent bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. Asymmetrical left apical thickening with volume loss is likely a sequela of previous radiation therapy.
