In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, there is been a substantial in the right pleural effusion, now small to moderate, after interval placement of a right-sided chest tube. There is substantial associated right basilar atelectasis, but no pneumothorax. Heart size is difficult to determine, but there is a mild pulmonary edema. An ET tube terminates just above the clavicles.
