Tracheostomy and sternotomy wires are in place. A pleural pigtail catheter projects over the right costophrenic angle. A left PICC line tip terminates at the mid SVC. A peripheral catheter is identified with the tip terminating in the right axilla. As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there still remains a tiny apical right pneumothorax. There is opacification of the left hemidiaphragm which likely relates to atelectasis and pleural effusion. There is right basal atelectasis. There is severe cardiomegaly.
