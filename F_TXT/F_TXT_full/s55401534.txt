Homogeneous opacity persists in the right mid and lower lung region, obscuring both the right heart border and right hemidiaphragm. Correlative CT imaging from ___ demonstrates collapse of the right middle and right lower lobe as well as a right pleural effusion. The left lung is clear except for minimal atelectasis at the left lung base and a probable very small left pleural effusion. A nasogastric tube has been exchanged for a new wider-caliber tube, which terminates in the proximal stomach and could be advanced for more standard positioning.
