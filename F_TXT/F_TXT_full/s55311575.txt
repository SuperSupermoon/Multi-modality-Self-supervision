AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination of ___. On the present image, the patient is intubated with the ETT terminating in the trachea 4 cm above the level of the carina. No pneumothorax has developed. Overlying cables and electrodes appear to be external. Identified is a catheter approached from below passing the right atrium and the right ventricular outflow tract so to terminate in the proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery. A second external device consists of an intra-aortic balloon pump device that terminates appropriately in the upper portion of the descending aorta. Its termination point is just below the expected lower contour of the aortic arch. Chest findings have changed dramatically since the preceding chest examination of ___ when the patient was in acute advanced pulmonary edema with additional evidence of bilateral pleural effusions. Pleural effusions have disappeared as at least on the supine image the lateral pleural sinuses are completely free. Lungs demonstrate still a typical pulmonary edema pattern with subtle haze bilaterally in the central lung regions. These findings, however, have improved markedly and there is no evidence of any remaining peripheral pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate. No pneumothorax is present in the apical area. The overall heart size is presently not significantly enlarged as can be identified on a single portable chest view. An NG tube is also seen to reach well below the diaphragm including its side port.
