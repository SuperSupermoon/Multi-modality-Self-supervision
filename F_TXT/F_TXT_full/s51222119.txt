Since prior studies, there has been increased diffuse lung opacification most pronounced in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe. Left chest wall mass causing bony destruction, better seen on recent PET-CT. Mediastinal contour is normal. Cardiac contour is ill-defined secondary to lung opacity. There is no pneumothorax.
