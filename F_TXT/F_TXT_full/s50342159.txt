There relatively low lung volumes. No focal consolidation is seen. There is slight blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles, similar to prior which may be due to overlying soft tissue versus trace pleural effusion. No pulmonary edema is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable to slightly less prominent compared to the prior study.
