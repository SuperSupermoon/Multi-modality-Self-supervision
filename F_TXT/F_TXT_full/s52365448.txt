Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Bilateral asymmetrically distributed heterogeneous alveolar opacities have slightly improved in the interval, particularly in the right middle and lower lung regions. Residual opacities are most severe in the right upper lobe adjacent to the minor fissure. The lung apices remain relatively spared of this process.
