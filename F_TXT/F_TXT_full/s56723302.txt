Interval pullback of the right chest tube which now has its tip overlying the right mid lung, but the side port now projects over the lateral ribs and subcutaneous tissues. Advancement of 1-2 cm would be advised. This recommendation was called to the patient's nurse, ___, on ___ at 10:05 a.m. who states that the housestaff are aware. There is persistent layering right effusion and layering left effusion with more focal persistent airspace consolidation in the left base with associated air bronchograms. Although this may represent compressive atelectasis, basilar pneumonia cannot be excluded. Linear opacity in the left mid lung persists and likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis. There is also likely mild vascular congestion. The tracheostomy tube and right subclavian central line are unchanged in position. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in positioning between studies. The evaluation for pneumothorax is limited given supine technique.
