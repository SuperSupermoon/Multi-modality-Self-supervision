Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is new retrocardiac opacification which likely corresponds to left lower lobe collapse. There is moderate central vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema. Significantly calcified aortic arch is again noted. Elevation of the left mainstem bronchus is likely a function of left atrial enlargement. There is likely a small left pleural effusion.
