AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in upright position. Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. Previously present mild enlargement of the heart appears stable. Configuration suggests mild enlargement of left atrial contour resulting in a double contour within the right-sided heart shadow. The pulmonary vasculature shows an upper zone redistribution pattern with mild perivascular haze. There is no evidence of advanced interstitial or alveolar edema. Similar as shown on the previous examination, there is mild blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus, probably indicative of scar formation as the posterior pleural sinus was free on the preceding examination. When comparison is made of the frontal views, there is a suggestion of some increased plethora of the pulmonary vasculature and slightly increased perivascular haze, but again acute pulmonary edema is not present. The present portable examination excludes the development of a new discrete pneumonic infiltrate.
