The new left IJ dialysis line tip projects in the low SVC. The right IJ tip is at the cavoatrial junction. The orogastric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm and out of view. The endotracheal tube terminates 6.5 cm above the carina, which may be positional in nature. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged. Tenting of left diaphragm and left-sided effusion/consolidation is unchanged since the prior day. No evidence of pneumothorax. Median sternotomy wires are intact.
