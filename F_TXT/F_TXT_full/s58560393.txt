Compared with the prior film, the chest tube is been removed. There is a new small left pleural effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Note is made of trace pneumomediastinal air, which has decreased compared with the prior film. No pneumothorax is detected. There are lower inspiratory volumes. Allowing for this, no definite change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Atelectasis at the right base. Mild vascular plethora is likely accentuated by low lung volumes. Sternotomy wires again noted. Right IJ central line tip overlies the mid/ distal SVC.
