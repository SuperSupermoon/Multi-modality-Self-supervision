Endotracheal tube is identified. Although tip is 3.0 cm cranial from the carina, it appears somewhat more lateral than expected to the left and confirmation of placement in the airway is suggested. Enteric tube is seen with tip in the gastric body, side port just above the GE junction. Low lung volumes are noted. No focal consolidation identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
