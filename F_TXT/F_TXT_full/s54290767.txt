The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. Given this, there is opacity at the left costophrenic angle with lateral left base opacity which may be due to pleural effusion with atelectasis and/or pleural thickening. No definite focal consolidation is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. There may also be a trace right pleural effusion/pleural thickening. No pneumothorax is seen.
