The patient is status post median sternotomy. A right lower lobe opacity reflects a fat containing Bochdalek's hernia as seen on the reference chest CT. There are bibasilar opacities, possibly reflecting atelectasis. No pleural effusion or overt pulmonary edema is noted. The heart is normal in size, and the thoracic aorta is enlarged as noted on the prior chest CT.
