Heart size is mildly enlarged, unchanged. Substantial calcifications of the mitral annulus are present. Lungs are overall well inflated but clear. Sclerotic changes in the left scapula might be potentially present as well as in the left humeral head. No focal consolidation to suggest acute infectious process noted. There is also most sclerotic appearance of the right first rib, most likely related to degenerative changes.
