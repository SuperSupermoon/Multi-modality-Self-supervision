As compared to the previous radiograph, the widespread bilateral parenchymal opacities, likely reflecting a combination of pulmonary edema and infection, are constant in appearance. They have neither increased nor decreased since the previous exam. Currently, there are no larger pleural effusions and the size of the cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. No pneumothorax. No new parenchymal changes.
