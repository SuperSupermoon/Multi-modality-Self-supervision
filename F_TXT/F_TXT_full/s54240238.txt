Slight interval improvement in bilateral airspace process, left greater than right, with associated layering effusions, left greater than right, all superimposed upon known emphysema. Findings consistent with improving moderate to severe pulmonary edema, less likely an acute infectious process. Right internal jugular large bore catheter unchanged in position. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable. Calcification of the aortic knob and descending aorta. Deformity of the left midclavicle suggesting old fracture. No pneumothorax.
