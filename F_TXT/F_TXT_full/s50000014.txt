Lung volumes are low. Retrocardiac opacity with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm and lateral border of the descending aorta is nonspecific and could reflect any of a combination of atelectasis, focal pneumonia or even a small effusion. Right infrahilar opacity with slight indistinctness of the right heart border could reflect infection in the appropriate clinical scenario. Apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm may be related to positioning and technique versus volume loss. There is cardiomegaly, but no CHF. Aortic calcifications are present. No pneumothorax.
