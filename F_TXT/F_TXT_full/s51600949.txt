AP chest compared to ___: The more focal consolidative abnormalities present on ___ are not as clear. I cannot tell whether this because they have improved or whether, more likely, they are not as obvious against a background of increasing moderately severe pulmonary edema and moderate right pleural effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly has worsened in the interim. No pneumothorax.
