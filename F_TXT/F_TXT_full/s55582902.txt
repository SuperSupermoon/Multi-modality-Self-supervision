Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. Moderate cardiomegaly is similar to ___. Left brachiocephalic and SVC vascular stents are in similar position to prior. There is calcification of the aortic knob. The pulmonary vascular markings are indistinct, compatible with congestion. There is a vague right lower lobe opacity, which likely represents mild atelectasis. No large pleural effusion is noted. No pneumothorax. Osseous structures appear unremarkable.
