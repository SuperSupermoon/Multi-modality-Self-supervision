An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.4 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present -- the tip is poorly visualized over the lower mediastinum but probably extends beneath the diaphragm. A left IJ central line is present -- its position is similar to the film from ___ at 2:15 a.m., perhaps slightly retracted compared with then. Its position is not fully characterized on this film -- it does not extend into the SVC, but may overlie the innominate vein. A dual-lumen right-sided central line is present, tips over mid/lower SVC and distalmost SVC near RA junction. Again seen is moderately-severe cardiomegaly, with increased interstitial and alveolar markings, suggesting CHF and pulmonary edema. There is a small right effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation. The possibility of background acute or chronic process is difficult to exclude.
