A left sided single lead pacer is seen with the lead terminating over the expected location of the right ventricle, although the tip is not completely imaged. The heart is enlarged likely reflecting cardiomegaly, although a pericardial effusion should also be considered. There is likely a layering left effusion with retrocardiac opacity which could reflect partial lower lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia in this area cannot be excluded. The remaining left lung and and right lung are clear. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
