Left chest wall dual lead pacing device is noted. Low lung volumes are seen with pulmonary vascular congestion. No visualized parenchymal markings identified at the left lung apex. Although no discrete pleural reflection is identified, this raises concern for underlying pneumothorax. Alternatively, could represent an underlying bleb. Moderate cardiac enlargement is accentuated by low lung volumes. Median sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are noted. Posterior left seventh, through tenth rib fractures are noted.
