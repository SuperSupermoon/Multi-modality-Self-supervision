As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. The patient carries a left-sided chest tube. At the site of tube insertion, there is an accumulation of air in the soft tissues. A millimetric left apical pneumothorax is seen. No evidence of tension. Unchanged position of the left PICC line. Atelectasis at the left lung bases, in part projecting over the left costophrenic sinus, but no evidence of pleural effusion. The right lung continues to be unchanged, minimal basal atelectasis, but no new parenchymal opacities. The mediastinal contours are constant in appearance.
