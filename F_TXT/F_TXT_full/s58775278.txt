Stable bilateral parenchymal opacities compatible with known metastatic disease, although given that it is more confluent at the right base, superimposed pneumonia or aspiration should also be considered. Probable layering right effusion or pleural thickening. Left Port-A-Cath unchanged in position. No pneumothorax. Asymmetric right apical pleural thickening could reflect post radiation changes or metastatic pleural involvement and/or loculated fluid.
