There is hyperinflation of the lungs and upper lobe predominant emphysema. Diffuse predominantly mid and lower lobe interstitial lung opacities are present, representing either atypical/opportunistic infection (such as Pneumocystis), dependent distribution of interstitial edema or inflammatory airway disease mimicking interstitial lung disease. The cardiomediastinal shilhouette and hilar are normal. There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
