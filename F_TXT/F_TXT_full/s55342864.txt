In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip at the upper clavicular level, approximately 5 cm above the carina. The cardiac silhouette seen somewhat more prominent as does the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion and dilatation of the azygos vein, raising the possibility of some right-sided cardiac failure. There is also a nasogastric tube in place with its tip crossing the lower margin of the image at the mid body level. Atelectatic changes are seen at both bases.
