Low lung volumes are relatively unchanged over multiple prior studies. There is no new focal opacity suggestive of pneumonia. Minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle is likely due to overlying soft tissues. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. There is no acute osseous abnormality.
