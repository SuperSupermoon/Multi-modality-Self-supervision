There is a new right chest tube and small right apical pneumothorax. The lung volumes are lower with increasing basilar opacities, which likely represents CHF with pulmonary edema, with some associated atelectasis. Other etiologies for an interstitial infiltrates, such as atypical infections and hypersensitivity pneumonitis remain in the differential, but relatively rapid advancement compared with ___ is more suggestive of CHF. There are small bilateral pleural effusions and unchanged mild cardiomegaly and prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Multiple pulmonary nodules described on the ___ CT scan are difficult to appreciate radiographically.
