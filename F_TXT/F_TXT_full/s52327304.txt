Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. The left costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image. There are relatively low lung volumes. There is slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle which may be due to overlying soft tissue, though a trace pleural effusion is not excluded. Mild basilar atelectasis is seen without definite focal consolidation. The aorta is tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is top normal. There is no overt pulmonary edema.
