Dramatic interval change in the appearance of the lower neo esophagus. Dr. ___ ___ me that the patient has had recent, interval upper abdominal surgery and I do not know what the radiographic appearance was or should have been following that surgery. It is unclear whether the neo esophagus is distended by a large bezoar or whether there is intussusception of the more distal GI tract into the neo esophagus or alongside the neo esophagus into the mediastinum. A small volume of subdiaphragmatic gas could be explained by recent surgery, a but radiographically I cannot exclude perforation and pneumoperitoneum as well as pneumomediastinum. Heart size is normal but mild interstitial edema is new. Opacity at the base the left lung is atelectasis. There is no good evidence for pneumonia or pneumothorax.
