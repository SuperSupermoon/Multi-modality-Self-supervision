The ETT terminates 3.7 cm above the carina. A feeding tube terminates in the stomach with the side hole at the level of the diaphragm. Diffuse hazy opacities are seen throughout the lungs bilaterally. More focal consolidative opacities are seen adjacent to the right hilum and in the left upper lung laterally. Findings may represent moderate to severe pulmonary edema, but cannot exclude an underlying pneumonia or aspiration in the right clinical setting. No pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured by the adjacent opacities but may be slightly enlarged.
