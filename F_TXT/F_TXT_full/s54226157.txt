Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier. Increased opacity in the right lung is likely due to increasing pleural effusion and increasing multifocal enlarged areas of atelectasis. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity is unchanged, consistent with almost complete collapse, better seen in prior CT from ___. There is no evident pneumothorax. Lines and tubes are in unchanged standard position. Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema are stable.
