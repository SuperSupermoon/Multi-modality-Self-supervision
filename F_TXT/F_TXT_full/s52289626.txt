Right pleural effusion has increased in size and is now moderate. There is a probable small right apical pneumothorax at the level of the third posterior rib. Lack of visibility of this finding on the prior study may have been related to differences in patient positioning. Again demonstrated is complete collapse of the left lower lobe secondary to a known central mass which has been more fully characterized by CT of ___. Worsening left upper opacity may reflect an evolving pneumonia or asymmetrical edema. Left pleural effusion and pleural calcification appear unchanged.
