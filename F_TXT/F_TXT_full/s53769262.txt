AP chest compared to ___, the only prior chest radiograph currently available: Discrete areas of abnormality are present in both lungs, any of which could be infection. The largest region of abnormality is in the lingula, partially obscuring the left heart border, but there is peribronchial opacification in the right lower lung. Chronic right rib fractures are probably responsible for some of the heterogeneous opacification in the right mid lung zone, in combination with local pleural thickening. Possibility of small bilateral pleural effusions should be considered. Healed left upper rib fracture is also noted. A lateral chest radiograph would be extremely useful in distinguishing consolidation from pleural and other findings.
