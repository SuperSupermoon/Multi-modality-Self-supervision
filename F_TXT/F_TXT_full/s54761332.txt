There is no placement of a new Dobbhoff tube, which courses down the left lower lobe bronchus. This needs to be removed immediately and replaced. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted, otherwise the lungs are clear and the cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
